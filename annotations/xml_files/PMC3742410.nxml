Practices (N=16) will be eligible to participate if they are registered to prescribe methadone and/or at least 10 patients of the practice are currently receiving addiction treatment. Patient must meet the following inclusion criteria to participate in this study: 18 years of age or older, receiving addiction treatment/care (eg, methadone), or known to be a problem drug user. This study is based on a complex intervention supporting SBI for problem alcohol use among problem drug users (experimental group) compared to an &#x0201c;assessment-only&#x0201d; control group. Control practices will be provided with a delayed intervention after follow-up. Primary outcomes of the study are feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to patients and practitioners. Secondary outcome includes the effectiveness of the intervention on care process (documented rates of SBI) and outcome (proportion of patients with problem alcohol use at the follow-up). A stratified random sampling method will be used to select general practices based on the level of training for providing addiction-related care and geographical area. In this study, general practitioners and practice staff, researchers, and trainers will not be blinded to treatment, but patients and remote randomizers will be unaware of the treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>This study is ongoing and a protocol system is being developed for the study.

Such alcohol use may decrease in response to psychosocial interventions whose benefits have been demonstrated in general adult populations. For example, a comprehensive review by Raistrick et al presented data on the effectiveness of many such interventions, including screening, further assessment, brief interventions, and alcohol-focused specialist treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>].</p><p>Primary care may have an important role in addressing problem alcohol use among problem drug users. Its potential impact on screening for alcohol problems and providing appropriate interventions in the general population has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>], although a recently published randomized trial indicates that more intensive primary-care-based interventions provide little by way of additional benefit to patient information alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>]. Internationally, screening and brief interventions (SBI) are recommended as a treatment of choice for reducing alcohol use among problem drinkers in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>], but these have not been tested in people who are addicted to other substances and who attend primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]. It is important to address this issue because of the serious complications associated with problem alcohol use in this population, that is, the potential to increase the likelihood of a relapse to problem drug use, medical/psychological complications, liver disease, and so on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>].</p><p>Similar to other evidence-based interventions, the evidence on SBIs translates slowly into practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>], and the findings from implementation studies are contradictory. For example, while a systematic review of interventions focused on increasing the use of SBI for hazardous alcohol consumption in primary care recommended complex, multicomponent strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>], a recent trial concluded that such a &#x0201c;tailored, multifaceted program aimed at improving general practitioner (GP) management of alcohol consumption&#x0201d; failed to show an effect and proved difficult to implement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>]. This also contradicts the conclusions of a recent paper, &#x0201c;real world evidence supports theory&#x0201d; of SBIs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>].</p><p>More impetus to this contradictory debate has been added by recent implementation studies and a controlled trial among problem drug users in secondary care that demonstrated feasibility of implementing SBIs among problem drug users in secondary care but suggested a controlled pilot study was necessary to establish key parameters for a similar evaluation in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>]. The present study is designed to evaluate these issues.</p></sec><sec><title>Previous Work in Ireland and Its Relation to Complex Intervention Theory</title><p>This protocol builds on our ongoing program of research that indicates (opiate) addiction treatment should also incorporate interventions that address problem use of alcohol and other illicit substances. For example, a national cross-sectional study reported that 35% of 196 patients attending GPs for methadone treatment also had problem alcohol use [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>], while findings from a subsequent qualitative study highlight the need for a complex intervention to address this problem in primary care [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>].</p><p>The UK Medical Research Council (MRC)&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Framework for the Development and Evaluation of Complex Interventions for Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>], which suggests following core phases to the development of complex health service interventions, informed the development of the intervention under study.</p><sec><title>Preclinical Phase: Theory and Problem Identification</title><p>A national prevalence study showed problem alcohol use among patients attending general practice for methadone maintenance was high (35%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>]. A review of scientific evidence found no studies examining this issue in primary care, but research in secondary or community care settings suggests that this type of intervention can be effective among problem drug users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 1: Modeling</title><p>The development of the complex intervention and clinical guidelines is informed by Cochrane Systematic review, qualitative interviews with health care providers and patients, and clinical guidelines.</p><p>Cochrane Systematic review was used to assess &#x0201c;psychosocial interventions for problem alcohol use in illicit drug users&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]. Qualitative interviews with health care providers and patients that showed that barriers to implementation of alcohol intervention for drug users in primary care include patient factors, health care professional factors, and structural issues. The implementation strategies should utilize educational and support systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]. Clinical guidelines&#x02014;informed by the findings of qualitative interviews, expert opinion through a Delphi-facilitated expert consensus process, and a Cochrane Systematic Review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]&#x02014;advocate SBI for problem alcohol use among problem drug users.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 2: Exploratory Study</title><p>A pilot study in addiction clinics showed that SBIs are effective in reducing alcohol consumption among opiate-dependent patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>]. There is a current proposal to establish the acceptability and effectiveness of the intervention by conducting a feasibility study in primary care.</p><p>This protocol reflects the development and piloting phases of the MRC&#x02019;s &#x0201c;Framework for the design and evaluation of complex interventions to improve health&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>]. The present study will provide key parameters regarding the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention to patients and practitioners. As such, this research is essential to inform the design and conduct of a larger cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT).</p><p>The specific objectives of the study are as follows. First, this study aims to develop a complex intervention that will enhance SBI for problem alcohol use among problem drug users in primary care. This study will help to establish the practical feasibility and acceptability of complex intervention (1) by conducting a pilot study (with randomization at the level of practice), (2) exploring the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention under study and related research procedures to GPs, practice nurses, and patients, and (3) exploring the fidelity of the interventions as delivered in practice. Finally, we can decide to inform the subsequent design of a definitive cluster RCT by describing the optimum configuration of the complex intervention and by estimating the key parameters in such a trial (ie, practice/patient recruitment and retention rates, intraclass correlation coefficient for primary outcome measures, and the likely effect of intervention under study on these measures).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Overview of Study Design</title><p>Psychosocial intervention for alcohol use among problem drug users (PINTA) is a pilot feasibility study of a complex intervention to promote SBI for problem alcohol use among problem drug users, with cluster randomization at the level of general practice, and integrated qualitative process evaluation, involving general practice in two regions.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Population</title><sec><title>Recruitment and Random Selection of Practices</title><p>The following practices will be invited to participate, given written information on the study and their interest in participating:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>All practices in two regions&#x02014;Health Services Executive (HSE) Midwest and Dublin Mid-Leinster regions</p></list-item><list-item><p>All practices that have been involved in previous related research with our group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref29">29</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>General practices in the study regions that are affiliated with two of the Ireland&#x02019;s six medical schools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref31">31</xref>]</p></list-item></list><p>Practices will be eligible to participate if they are registered to prescribe methadone and/or have at least 10 patients currently receiving addiction-related care.</p><p>Of those who confirm their <italic>interest</italic> in the study and who are eligible to participate, a stratified random sampling technique will be used to select 16 practices.</p><p>Sampled GPs will be contacted about their participation, given further information on the study (eg, what their involvement will entail) and consulted about patient recruitment. The research team will telephone those not replying. Each practice will be visited by the principal investigator or lead researcher and provided with the information about the research program.</p><p>To ensure comparability between intervention and control groups for key practice characteristics, a restricted allocation involving stratified approach to randomization will be adopted. Prior to randomization, GPs who express their interest in participating will be grouped according to the level of training in providing addiction-related care (level 1 and 2), geographical location (Dublin/Midwest), with 16 randomly selected GPs using an independent remote randomization service.</p><p>To prescribe methadone, GPs are subject to clinical audit and must complete special training, while GPs providing methadone treatment for 15 or more patients are subject to more regular audit and advanced training. GPs who prescribe methadone for less than 15 patients are referred to as &#x0201c;level 1 GPs,&#x0201d; and those prescribing for 15 or more as &#x0201c;level 2 GPs.&#x0201d; Initiation of methadone therapy, treatment of patients with more complex medical and psychosocial needs (including alcohol dependence), and unstable drug use are only permitted by specialist addiction treatment services or by &#x0201c;level 2 GPs.&#x0201d; A more complex, difficult cohort of patients is attended by level 2 GPs and this might have implications for the success of the intervention. Therefore, it will be introduced in the data analysis as a potential confounder.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification and Recruitment of Patients</title><p>Before introducing the complex intervention, each participating practice will engage in an intensive, 2-week period of patient recruitment, an approach we found most effective in previous qualitative work with this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]. This 2-week period will be supported by a member of the research team and will aim to: (1) establish a &#x0201c;disease&#x0201d; register of patients, (2) obtain contact details for and informed consent from eligible patients, (3) review the clinical records of patients who consent to participate in the study, and (4) collect baseline data, including patient demographics and current care process/outcome measures from clinical records.</p><p>Patients will be eligible to participate if they are 18 years of age or older, receiving addiction treatment/care (eg, methadone), or known problem drug user, and attending a participating general practice for general medical care. They will be excluded from the study if they have language difficulties (ie, unable to speak, read, and write English well enough to complete study questionnaires), are acutely intoxicated, and/or are cognitively impaired (including severe mental health illness) to the extent that they are unable to provide informed consent to participate.</p><p>Systematic random sampling of patients in participating practices is difficult in studies among this population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>]. Hence, a standardized nonprobability sampling framework will be used to identify <italic>consecutive</italic> patients from each practice on whom data will be collected for the purpose of the study. Potential patient selection bias will be assessed in the exploratory data analysis, by comparing the sociodemographics of the included patients with all patients, who were identified as problem drug users, in each practice.</p><p>Patients who consult a GP taking part in the study, and who in the clinical opinion of the GP are eligible to participate in the study (see inclusion criteria above), will be given written information on the study. Those interested in participating will be invited to meet a researcher who will be at the practice during the recruitment period. At this meeting, interested patients will be given further information on the study and will have an opportunity to ask questions from the researcher. If patients consent to participate, they will be asked to sign a consent form and complete a self-/interviewer-administered questionnaire that includes problem alcohol use and other outcome measures, if necessary with the assistance of the researcher at T1 (ie, Time 1, at baseline) and T2 (ie, Time 2, at 3 months follow-up). This applies to patients in both the intervention and control groups.</p><p>Following completion of the self-/interviewer-administered questionnaire with the researcher, patients in the intervention practices will be screened for problem alcohol use and delivered the brief intervention by their GP/practice team (at their earliest convenience). Patients in the control arm will receive the &#x0201c;Less is more&#x0201d; leaflet (a guide to rethinking your drinking, HSE, 2008) from the researcher. A &#x0201c;thank you&#x0201d; letter will be sent to all GPs and patients within 2 weeks of receiving completed study instruments/intervention. A reminder letter will be sent to all GPs and patients 5 weeks before the follow-up assessments, informing them of the anticipated time/date of their appraisal. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref> presents the CONSORT diagram of participant flow and follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Power Calculations and Sample Size Estimates</title><p>The goals of this study are to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of the complex intervention. As observed in previous studies, with respect to the feasibility component, the present study aims to achieve 20% recruitment/consent rate (ie, number of invited GPs who confirm their interest in the study) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>], 75% participation rate (ie, the number of participants allocated to the intervention arm who will receive/complete SBI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>], and 75% retention or follow-up rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>].</p><p>Based on the recommendations for good practice in pilot studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref33">33</xref>], we estimate that 160 patients (attending 16 general practices) will be adequate to calculate the actual recruitment and retention rates (ie, <italic>feasibility</italic>) for a sample of patients recruited in primary care and provide data on <italic>acceptability</italic> of study processes and outcome measures, which will inform a future definitive trial. This pilot study is not powered to determine effectiveness of SBI on reduction of alcohol consumption among problem drug users. The proportion of patients who reduce their alcohol consumption will be used to predict the sample size and length of follow-up for a future definitive RCT.</p><fig id="figure1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>CONSORT diagram: participant flow and follow-up.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="resprot_v2i2e26_fig1"/></fig></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><sec><title>Overview</title><p>A staggered intervention design will be adopted, whereby participating practices randomized to the intervention arm of the study will be provided with the complex intervention for the duration of the study period, while practices randomized to the control arm of the study will provide usual care to patients for the duration of the study and will be provided with the complex intervention thereafter (ie, delayed intervention). Such an approach was used successfully in our previous cluster randomized controlled study to improve screening for hepatitis C among problem drug users attending general practice in Ireland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Control Intervention</title><p>All practices (control and intervention arms) will be required to establish a &#x0201c;disease&#x0201d; register of &#x0201c;problem drug users&#x0201d; before the study onset. They will identify potential participants and recruit them for the study. At this stage, participants will be asked to sign an informed consent form. The research team will conduct interviews (telephonic or in person) to determine problem alcohol and other drug use and demographic details at baseline and at 3 months follow-up. Researchers will facilitate data collection (including morbidity and primary/secondary care utilization) from clinical records. Participating practices will be offered &#x020ac;50 per patient recruited to study upon receipt of completed data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref34">34</xref>].</p><p>We consider the above engagement with practices as close to &#x0201c;usual care&#x0201d; as possible while still allowing evaluation of the complex intervention. To enable the development of a practice register of people with problem drug use, clinical records and prescribing information will be reviewed. For practices who use electronic patient records, an International Classification of Primary Care disease code (P19) will be assigned to patients who meet the criteria of European Monitoring Center for Drugs and Drug Addiction for problem drug use. For practices who use paper records, this register will be developed in a hard copy.</p></sec><sec><title>Experimental Intervention</title><p>A complex intervention will be delivered to practices assigned to the intervention arm at two levels: (1) practice level and (2) patient level.</p><p>Interventions that are delivered at practice level include CME/CPD-accredited education delivered both internally (practice-based academic detailing) and externally (seminar), dissemination of clinical guidelines, other resources to facilitate implementation at practice level (eg, contact details/referral information for local services).</p><p>All practices will participate in the external education (seminar).
