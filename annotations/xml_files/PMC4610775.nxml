The study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Second People&#x02019;s Hospital of Huai&#x02019;an, and informed consents were obtained from all the participants. Patients with dizziness, transient ischemic attack, and 70% or more internal carotid artery stenosis on one or both sides as determined by neuroimaging examination such as digital subtraction angiography and magnetic resonance imaging were included in the study.<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-5595" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Patients were excluded if they had a history of major medical illness, such as heart failure, pulmonary insufficiency, renal insufficiency, hepatic dysfunction, or blood diseases unfit for antiplatelet therapy.<xref rid="b4-dddt-9-5595" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Participants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either a UK treatment (UK group) or a conventional treatment (control group) using a computer-generated random sequence. The UK group consisted of 45 patients (24 men and 21 women) aged from 42 years to 84 years, including 21 cases of unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis, twelve cases of bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis, eight cases of unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis associated with vertebral artery stenosis, and four cases of unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis associated with middle cerebral artery stenosis. The control group also consisted of 45 patients (26 men and 19 women) aged from 40 years to 79 years, including 19 cases of unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis, eleven cases of bilateral internal carotid artery stenosis, ten cases of unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis associated with vertebral artery stenosis, and five cases of unilateral internal carotid artery stenosis associated with middle cerebral artery stenosis. All patients had experienced at least 1 month of nervous-system dysfunctions. No severe cerebrovascular problems such as stroke occurred during the study period. Clinical symptoms of cerebral ischemia, such as paralysis of limbs and/or disturbance of consciousness, were observed in most of the cases.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Procedures</title><p>The study procedure is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-dddt-9-5595">Figure 2</xref>. During the study period, all patients were given 75 mg of clopidogrel and 100 mg of enteric-coated aspirin orally once a day in addition to the use of salvia, puerarin (Conba Phamaceuticals, Zhejiang, People&#x02019;s Republic of China), and an anti-free-radical agent, edaravone (Lijun Phamaceuticals, Xian, People&#x02019;s Republic of China), as conventional treatment in the control group. In addition, UK was injected into patients in the UK group at a dose of 0.15 paranitroanilinum (PNA)/d every day for 21 days. There was no daily and total effect of a daily injection of UK on blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, and heart rate. Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) scale was performed to evaluate the efficacy of UK on the cognitive status before treatment and at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after treatment in all patients. MMSE scale was scored by experienced neurologists, who had over 10 years of experience in professional neuropsychological scale assessment and were blinded to the clinical findings. Moreover, 5 mL blood samples were collected via cubital vein from patients before treatment and at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after treatment. The blood samples were centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 10 minutes, and sera were immediately collected and stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C. Then, serum concentrations of A&#x003b2; were determined using solid-phase sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit as per the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions (Adlitteram Diagnostic Laboratories, San Diego, CA, USA).

Meanwhile, improved cognitive status in patients accompanied by A&#x003b2;1-40 decrease at 4 weeks after treatment and by A&#x003b2;1-42 decrease at 8 weeks after treatment, possibly through decreased production or increased clearance of A&#x003b2; fragments in cerebral tissues due to improved cerebral blood flow by UK.
