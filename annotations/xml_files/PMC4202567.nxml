Neuroimaging studies have shown that one of the most important areas corresponding to the working memory is the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLFPC).

Introduction</title><p>Working memory refers to a the ability responsible for the limited and temporary storage and processing of information for manipulating, recalling or association with other incoming information. According to the central executive model (Baddly, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">1986</xref>), an attentional control system should be responsible for the strategy selection, control and co-ordination of the various processes involved in short-term storage and more general processing tasks. An important characteristic of this system is a limitation of resources and variations in processing, storage and functions (Salmon et al, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>).</p><p>According to Baddley (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>), working memory transiently stores and processes information underlying attention. These comprise functions such as learning, language and reasoning which are supported with complex cognitive operations. Furthermore, it plays a critical role in cognitive processes which are central to one's daily life. Several brain regions are shown to be involved in working memory processing. They include dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), inferior frontal gyrus, hippocampus, globuspallidus, caudate nucleus, putamen, amygdala (Sadleir, Vannorsdall, Schretlen, Gordon, <xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), dorsal occipital area, frontal eye field, intraparietal sulcus, inferior temporal gyrus, posterior middle frontal gyrus, and the superior parietal lobule (Pessoa et al., <xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Functional neuroimaging studies however have suggested a dominant role for DLPFC in this respect (Paulesu et al, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). This area becomes highly activated when precise information monitoring for spatial, non-spatial, verbal and visual stimuli is required (Funahashi et al., <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>). Meanwhile, the medial parts of prefrontal cortex contribute to the maintenance and retrieval of the recently encoded information (Zimmer, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, Mottaghy et al. <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>).</p><p>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive method to manipulate the cortical activity using a continuous weak electric current induced by large electrodes placed on the scalp of the subject (Nitsche, et al., <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The amount of the electrical current going to the brain is enough to cause focal and prolonged, but yet reversible shifts on cortical excitability (Wagner et al., <xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>, Miranda et al., <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). These manipulations have diverse effects on brain functioning, depend on site, polarity and size of the stimulation (Javadi &#x00026; Walsh, <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). This method has been proposed to be applied for the rehabilitation of working memory deficits seen in mental or neurological disorders such as Alzheimer, depression or Parkinson's Diseases (Ferrucci et al, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Kalu et al, <xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Boggio et al, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), while more evidence is required to support this application. A growing body of evidence has substantiated that different tDCS electrode positioning result in various modulatory effects both normal subjects and patients (Boggio et al., <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ferrucci et al, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Fregni et al., <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Marshall et al., <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Fregni et al. (<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) found that 1 mA of online anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC for a period of 10 minutes, enhances the accuracy of the 3-back working memory task, compared to sham and cathodal tDCS applied to the same area. However, bilateral tDCS stimulation of DLPFC during the modified Sternberg working memory task either for the anodal or cathodal stimulation, increases reaction time (Marshall et al., <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Ohn et al. (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) assessed the working memory during 30 minutes under 1 mA anodal tDCS stimulation applied to left DLPFC. They identified a linear improvement of the working memory over time. In a similar report, a 2 mA tDCS stimulation was shown to improve the working memory in patients with Parkinson's Disease, whereas 1 mA stimulation led to no significant effect (Boggio et al. <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>). Ferrucci et al. (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) showed that either the anodal or cathodal stimulation over the cerebellum did not alter the working memory proficiency in Sternberg's test. In another study, they reported that one anodal session of temporal cortex in patients with Alzheimer's Disease improved memory performance, whereas the impact of applying several sessions of stimulation on long-term improvement remained controversial. More recently, Mulquiney, et.al (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) have found that the anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC may significantly improve the performance speed in a 2-back working memory task, while this is not shown to have effects on the accuracy of performance. These finding would imply that effect of tDCS heavily depend on various variables, including: the side, the power, the polarity of stimulation.</p><p>Taken the above insights together, the aim of the current is to investigate any possible effects of the simultaneous excitation of the bilateral DLPFC on working memory.</p></sec><sec id="S0002"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="S20003"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Sixty healthy college students (30 male) were recruited from Shahid Beheshti University. Participants were randomly assigned into two subgroups (15 female in each) with respect to the side and polarity of the stimulation, i.e. left anodal/ right cathodal vs. left cathodal/ right anodal stimulation of the DLPFC. The mean and standard deviation of age for the groups were; 22.3 years, (sd= 0.86) And 21.2 years, (sd=0.67). The difference in age was not significant. Participants gave an informed consent form for taking part in the study. All of them met the inclusion criteria for tDCS (Nitsche, et al., <xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>), and none had previously experienced tDCS experiments. Exclusion criteria were substance abuse, history of serious head injury, or any other serious medical condition interfering with tDCS application or working memory performance.</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>2.2. Design</title><p>The study had a single-blinded 2x2x2 repeated measure design. Each participant underwent two sessions with at least 3 days interval to minimize any potential carry over effect of stimulation. They received active or sham tDCS stimulation for 20 minutes while performed the task just before and after to the stimulation. The stimulation session's order was randomized and counterbalanced across participants to overcome the learning effect on the outcome measures. A same 2-back working memory task was used in all pre/ post assessments. This task is a sensitive measure to cognitive changes in a variety of disorders and has minimal learning effects, making it an ideal task for repeated testing (Maruff et al., <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Mulquiny et al., <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). All stimulation sessions were carried out by the same researcher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Sequence of task presentation and stimulation. Participants were first required to perform 2-back working memory task. Then the tDCS stimulation was applied over left and right DLPFC, during 20 minutes. Finally, post 2-back working memory task was assessed.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="BCN-4-224-g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="S20005"><title>2.3. Procedure</title><p>Participants were briefed about the procedure at the beginning of each session. The location of right and left DLPFC were determined based on Dasilva et al.'s (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) method. Each participant was instructed to response to a computerized working memory task by pressing button 1 or 2 as he or she decided whether each figure was identical to the one presented two earlier in the sequence. They were instructed to press the key 1 if the presented figure was the same as the figure presented two stimuli previously, and if not to press the key 2.</p></sec><sec id="S20006"><title>2.4. Measures</title><sec><title>2.4.1. Working Memory Task</title><p>A visual sequential 2-back figure working memory (Mull &#x00026; Seyal, <xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) was used in this study. Subjects were presented with a pseudo-random set of six figures. The stimuli were generated using the MATLAB software. A 2-back working memory task, is considered as an active task, since the working memory should be continuously updated (Zimmer, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Subject were asked to press the key 1 if the presented figure was the same as the figure presented two stimuli previously, and if not, press the key 2. One hundred figures which were divided into six different series were prepared in the task and totally 20 correct responses were obtained from each set. Figures were presented randomly and sequentially while for each figure the subject had to memorize it then press the key 1 or 2 based on what image he or she sees in the next sequence. Subjects&#x02019; speed as well as correct responses was recorded. The applied 2-back working memory task remained the same for all participants.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4.2. Stimulation</title><p>Stimulation was applied with a battery-driven device (Activa Dose Iontophoresis manufactured by ActivaTek), which was capable of delivering the anodal, cathodal direct current and sham direct current required for this study. Direct current was delivered through two 25 cm2 (5&#x000d7;5) electrodes, covered by sponge pad soaked in sodium chloride solution. The stimulator was set to fade in and out over a period of 30s at the beginning and the end of the stimulation session.</p><sec><title>2.4.2.1. Active Stimulation</title><p>Active stimulation was applied at 2 mA. The left cathodal/right anodal stimulation was conducted with the anode placed over the right DLPFC and cathode over the left DLPFC, and in the reverse order for the left anodal / right cathodal stimulation. The electrodes were positioned with an elastic band according to electrode placement measuring method.</p></sec><sec><title>2.4.2.2. Sham Stimulation</title><p>During sham stimulation by positioning electrodes as same as active tDCS condition a constant current faded in for 30 s before being immediately faded out for 30 s, and the tingling sensation associated with tDCS was noticeable only for the first 1 min. This coding and setting required the subject to be blind, resulting in a single-blinded experiment.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2.4.3. Statistical Analysis</title><p>For both accuracy and speed, we conducted a 2 &#x000d7; 2 &#x000d7; 2 ANOVA repeated measure (pre/post &#x000d7; electrode position&#x000d7; stimulation) of participants&#x02019; working memory. We conducted a general linear model repeated measures analysis on the factors working memory scores (pre vs. post) and tDCS stimulation condition (active vs. sham stimulation) was employed. To determine more specifically whether the accuracy after tDCS differed in stimulation condition paired samples for the intra group active versus sham comparisons, two-tailed analysis with significance level of P &#x0003c; 0.05, not adjusted for multiple comparisons were performed. The dependent variables were checked for the normal distribution.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="S0012"><title>3. Results</title><sec id="S20013"><title>3.1.

Discussion</title><p>We attempted to investigate the effects of the bilateral stimulation of the DLPFC on working memory. Our results indicated that the left anodal / right cathodal stimulation of the DLPFC impaired the accuracy of the task performance as compared to the sham stimulation of the same area. Both stimulation types had no effects on the speed of working memory performance. Our results were incongruent with previous studies (Fregni et al, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ohn et al, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; javadi &#x00026; walsh, 2011; Javadi &#x00026; Cheng, 2011), which showed that anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC enhances the working memory performance.</p><p>These data raises the question of whether the difference in our results with previous studies is due to the type of stimulation electrode position. In other words, could simultaneous stimulation of right DLPFC with left DLPFC interferes with the working memory performance.</p><p>Incongruent with literature about brain stimulation effects on working memory, the present study showed that the left anodal stimulation of DLPFC with simultaneous cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC not only failed to enhance the accuracy performance of the participants, but also decreased the accuracy in their working memory performance. Though, we should consider to the role of the cathode electrode applied over the right DLPFC.</p><p>Some neuroimaging studies (Funahashi et al, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">1990</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">1991</xref>; Salmon et al, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>) have demonstrated the right DLPFC activation during a visual working memory task. Likewise, some other report have showen that this region is involved in working memory (D'Esposito et al, 1998; Smith and Jonides, 1999). Moreover, lesion studies (Goldman &#x00026; Rosvold, <xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">1970</xref>; Bauer &#x00026; Fuster, <xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">1976</xref>; Funahashi, Bruce, &#x00026; Goldman-Rakic, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>) have indicated that when this area is damaged, the working memory is notably affected. It has been found that transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the right DLPFC with disruption of function, results in impaired visual working memory capacity (Oliveri et al., <xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Turatto, Sandrini, &#x00026; Miniussi, <xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>, Sligte et al, <xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). It should be noted that this study measured the working memory performance with a visual 2-back working memory task. Thus, present results are in line to confirm the role of the right DLPFC on visual working memory, based on which dampening the right DLPFC leads to the performance deterioration in some aspects of cognitive functions such as the visual working memory.</p><p>To distinguish the role of the right and left DLPFC in visual working memory, our results suggest that the involvement of the left prefrontal area in visual working memory depends on the verbal encoding of visual stimuli (Smith and Jonides, 1997), whereas the stimuli used in this study were unfamiliar and unmeaning images, thus so difficult to use in verbal encoding with. Therefore, with respect to more dominant role of the right prefrontal on image-based visual working memory than the left DLPFC (Hong et al, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>), we may assume that the disruption of the right DLPFC function in left anodal/right cathodal stimulation impaired the accuracy by interfering in processing of visual stimuli in working memory performance.</p><p>On the other hand, methodological consideration should be entertained. Our study, however differs with previous studies in a several ways. The stimulation intensity in our study was 2 mA, while the previous studies used 1-2 mA. This consideration is important that stimulation intensity is a critical parameter, in which Boggio et al (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>) showed that 2 mA versus 1 mA current stimulation over the left DLPFC can enhance the working memory in patients with Parkinson's Disease. In addition, we tested the working memory performance before and after the stimulation, whereas others (Fregni et al, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ohn et al, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Boggio et al, 2008; Jvadi and Walsh, 2011) tested this during the online stimulation. Some evidences suggest that stimulation of the brain areas during the task accomplishment have different effect in comparison with offline stimulation (Nitsche &#x00026;Paulus, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>). Moreover, the duration of stimulation in this study was 20 min, which was higher than other studies. We applied bilateral stimulation, in which Ohn et al (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) confirmed that longer stimulation was enhanced working memory performance. Although, some other studies (Fregni et al, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ohn et al, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Javadi &#x00026; Walsh, 2011; Mulquiney et al, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Javadi&#x00026; Cheng, 2011) used unilateral stimulation of the left DLPFC, It has been shown that electrode positioning affects the flow of the current and so likely the stimulated brain area (Im et al, <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Nitsche M, Paulus, <xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). However, considering Marshall et al (<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>) study in which they used the bilateral intermittent stimulation of the lateral prefrontal cortex, it should be noted that this type of electrode positioning impairs the response selection-related processing. Taken together, it seems that the bilateral stimulation of DLPFC in present study was responsible for the impairment of accuracy and exerted declining effects on working memory. This observation is important as it might indicate that the bilateral stimulation can affect brain in a different way compared to unilateral stimulation. Therefore, it seems likely that other unilateral or bilateral electrode positioning lead to a significant improvement in the working memory accuracy.</p><p>With regard to the speed of working memory, bilateral stimulation of DLPFC results in slowing the speed in working memory (Marshall et al, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Discrepancy in our finding with others&#x02019; results may be due to the task type and current. We examined the 2-back working memory task, whereas they tested Sternberg's working memory task. In addition, we applied the constant current, while they used an intermittent stimulation during the experiment. In another study, Left anodal stimulation of the DLPFC enhanced the speed of the performance in working memory task (Mulquiney et al, <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) whereas, some other works (Fregni et al, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>; Ohn et al, <xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Javadi and Walsh, 2011; Jvadi &#x00026; Cheng, 2011) showed that the anodal stimulation of the left DLPFC did not alter the speed of working memory performance. In the present study, the bilateral stimulation effect on speed was in line with the two later reports. Thus, we can acclaim that type of electrode positioning may meaningfully affect the operations in working memory.</p><p>With respect to tDCS, in future studies it may also be advantageous to investigate the role of the right DLPFC in working memory performance with other electrode positioning. In the previous brain stimulation studies, little attention is paid to the role of the right DLPFC in working memory performance. While the right DLPFC is shown to be involved in an extended range of working memory dimentions (Zimmer, <xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Paulesu et al, <xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>; Salmon et al, <xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Moreover, it should be noted that there is little definite evidence explaining whether the effect of tDCS in working memory is indeed via modulation of the DLPFC excitability and if yes, under what possible mechanism(s)? Further studies should proceed to investigate the functional differences between the right and left DLPFC in visual working memory.</p><p>In summary, our study indicated that tDCS effect on working memory performance, is dependent to the electrode positioning, and Bilateral stimulation of DLPFC have negative effect on the accuracy of performance upon a working memory task.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are grateful to Dr.Vahid Nejati for providing the n-back task and Mehrshad Golesorkhi for the helpful revision of our manuscript.</p></ack><ref-list id="references"><title>References</title><ref id="CIT0001"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name><surname>Baddeley</surname>, <given-names>A.</given-names></string-name></person-group> (<year>1992</year>). <article-title>Working memory</article-title>. <source>Science</source>. <volume>225</volume>, <fpage>556</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>559</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">1736359</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="CIT0002"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><string-name><surname>Baddeley</surname>, <given-names>A.</given-names></string-name>, <string-name><surname>Logie</surname>, <given-names>R.
