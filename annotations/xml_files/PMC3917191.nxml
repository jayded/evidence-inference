Among all malignancies, it has the greatest effects on emotional and mental aspects of the patients. While 25-33% of patients with non-hematological malignancies suffer from anxiety disorder, some studies have reported the rate among patients with leukemia as high as 50%. Anxiety can negatively affect other important characteristics and parameters in patients with cancer. Furthermore, cancer increases the patients&#x02019; spiritual needs. Therefore, spirituality has a significant role in adapting to leukemia and coping with its consequent mental disorders such as anxiety. This study was hence performed to determine the effects of a spiritual care program on anxiety of patients with leukemia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>This randomized clinical trial was conducted in Sayyed-Al-Shohada Hospital affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Isfahan, Iran) in 2012. Sixty four adult patients with leukemia were randomly divided into the experiment and control groups. The spiritual care program including supportive presence and support for religious rituals was implemented for 3 days. Anxiety subscale from the 42-item depression, anxiety and stress scale was completed before and after the intervention for both groups. Data was analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistical methods (Chi-square, paired and independent <italic>t</italic>-tests) in SPSS<sub>18</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>There was no significant difference between the two groups before the intervention. However, after the intervention, mean score of anxiety were significantly lower in the experiment group than in the control group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). There was also a significant difference in the scores of the experiment group before and after the intervention (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01). Such a difference was absent in the control group.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Our spiritual care program could successfully decrease anxiety levels in patients with leukemia.

For example, in 2006, a study on 85 American patients with cancer showed that obtaining higher scores in the spiritual domain had no impact on levels of anxiety and depression.[<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] Likewise, Koszycki <italic>et al</italic>. showed the absence of a statistically significant correlation between spirituality and psychological adjustment among patients with cancer.[<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]</p><p>Despite the special importance of spiritual health and care, position, history and depth of spirituality in Iran, the penetration of spiritual beliefs into every Iranian's mind and the importance of spiritual care in controlling anxiety as a common disorder among leukemic patients, we failed to find a similar Iranian study in the available literature. On the other hand, cultural and racial factors, spiritual beliefs and customs of every race and nationality can have considerable impacts on the results of studies on anxiety.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] Due to the mentioned reasons and contradictory results of previous research, we designed and implemented a spiritual care program and evaluated its effects on anxiety of patients with leukemia admitted to intensive care unit of Sayyed-Al-Shohada Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) in 2012.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>In this pretest-posttest randomized clinical trial, spiritual care and anxiety were considered as independent and dependent variables, respectively. Patients admitted to intensive care unit of Sayyed-Al-Shohada Hospital (Isfahan, Iran) were included if they were definitely diagnosed with leukemia by a Hematologist, consented to participate and were Shiite, Native Iranian and Persian speaker. Patients who were unaware of their disease, had mental retardation, blindness, deafness or active mental diseases or were undergoing chemotherapy, radiotherapy or surgery were not included. The subjects were excluded in case of unwillingness to continue the study, any troubles that prevented the person from participating or transfer of the patient to another hospital. The participants were randomly allocated to experiment and control groups (<italic>n</italic> = 32 in each) using envelopes containing numbers from a table of random numbers.</p><p>Data were collected through a two-part questionnaire. The first part assessed demographic and disease-related data (age, sex, education, marital status, employment, type of leukemia, type of treatment and elapsed time from diagnosis). The second part comprised the anxiety subscale from the 42-item depression, anxiety and stress scale (DASS-42). DASS-42 is <sup>1</sup>a self-report scale, which was designed by Lovibond in 1995 to measure anxiety, depression and stress.[<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] The subscale of anxiety (items number 2, 4, 7, 9, 15, 19, 20, 23, 25, 28, 30, 36, 40 and 41) include statements to measure physiological over-arousal, fears and situational anxiety.[<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref><xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>] The questions of this scale are scored from zero to three and the total scores of the anxiety subscale are categorized as normal (0-7), mild (8-9), moderate (10-14), severe (15-19) and extremely severe (over 20).[<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]</p><p>Lovibond and Lovibond tested DASS-42 on a non-clinical sample of 2914 patients to measure its psychometric properties. They calculated the reliability of anxiety subscale as Cronbach's alpha = 0.84.[<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] In Iran, Afzali <italic>et al</italic>. found all three subscales to have high Cronbach's alpha coefficients (&#x003b1; = 0.85 for the anxiety subscale).[<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]</p><p>Before initializing the study, approvals were obtained from the School of Nursing and Midwifery (Isfahan University of Medical Sciences) and Hospital authorities. The selected subjects were then assured about data confidentiality and their access to final results and asked to sign informed consent forms.</p><p>A researcher (a man for male patients and a woman for females) presented at the bedside of the experiment group and implemented the spiritual care program. DASS-42 was completed before the intervention and at the end of the 3<sup>rd</sup> day by an unaware co-researcher who had been briefed explained by the researcher before the beginning of the study. The planning and implementation of the spiritual care program was closely monitored by the main researcher. Based on a previous study by Moeini <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] the patients in the experiment group received the spiritual care at 16:00-20:00 for 3 days.</p><p>The planned spiritual care program included two major components of supportive presence and support for religious rituals. The researcher supported the patients through encouraging them to express their feelings, needs and concerns through verbal and nonverbal communication, providing them with a detailed description of the disease and its therapeutic process and responding to their questions in this regard, taking their hands while talking and touching them using a supportive approach and using active listening technique. Furthermore, the researcher avoided any prejudgments about the patients&#x02019; appearance, accent and behavior, particularly at admission. In all stages of the intervention, patients were called with their name to preserve their dignity and respect.</p><p>In order to support religious rituals, patients were provided a pack containing a prayer rug and rosary and a veil for women. Patients were also informed about their free access to an MP3 player and earphones to listen to Quran, Prayers and Azan. Reading the Tawasol Prayer and Quran on the patient bedside was also implemented by a clergyman.[<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref><xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref><xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref><xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]</p><p>Data was analyzed using the descriptive (absolute frequency, relative frequency, mean and standard deviation) and inferential statistics (Chi-square test, paired <italic>t</italic>-test and independent <italic>t</italic>-test).

High school graduates constituted 46.9% of the experiment group and 50.0% of the control group.

The mean elapsed time from diagnosis was 24.32 (13.84) months in the experiment group and 18.08 (14.09) months in the control group. Most patients in both groups had the history of hospitalization and all subjects had undergone chemotherapy.</p><p>According to independent <italic>t</italic>-test results, no significant difference existed between the mean scores of anxiety of the two groups at the beginning of the study (15.31 [8.77] in the experiment group and 13.28 [8.28] in the control group; <italic>t</italic> = 0.95; <italic>P</italic> = 0.34). The spiritual care program decreased the mean score of anxiety to 6.06 (4.31) in the experiment group.

In contrast, paired <italic>t</italic>-test showed a significant difference between the scores of anxiety in the experiment group before and after the intervention (<italic>t</italic> = 8.29; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>D<sc>ISCUSSION</sc></title><p>Since the groups were randomly allocated, they were not significantly different in terms of demographic characteristics, type of leukemia, type of treatment, elapsed time from diagnosis and mean scores of anxiety at baseline. After the spiritual care program; however, the mean scores of anxiety were significantly lower in the experiment group than in the control group. Similarly, Yoon and Park showed that a spiritual nursing intervention could significantly reduce situational anxiety of the experiment group compared to the control group (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;5.99; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01).[<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] Puig <italic>et al</italic>. conducted a spiritual intervention on women with cancer and found significantly lower scores of anxiety in the experiment group than in the control group.[<xref rid="ref58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>] On the contrary, Ikedo <italic>et al</italic>. reported no significant difference in scores of anxiety following the implementation of a spiritual care program.[<xref rid="ref59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>] Differences in cultural and religious characteristics of the study populations, type of spiritual care program, sample size and type of disease might have been responsible for such an inconsistency.</p><p>In addition to the difference between the experiment and control groups, we also found a significant difference between the mean scores of anxiety before and after the spiritual care program in the experiment group. Delaney and Barrere performed a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental study to assess the impact of spiritual care on anxiety rate and spirituality of patient with cardiovascular diseases in New York. Their intervention included music sessions, guided visualization using a CD, praying and walking in a garden.
