<bold><italic>Background and Objective</italic></bold>: Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is the main concern for 40-70% of patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Our objective was to compare carbon dioxide gas at low pressure and standard pressure for the occurrence of PONV on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Methods:</italic></bold> This double- blind trial was conducted on 50 women patients aged between 18 to 60 years with acute cholecystectomy. The patients were divided into two groups: low pressure (LP) (received LP gas, 7-9 mmHg) and standard pressure (SP) (received SP gas, 14-15 mmHg). Nausea and vomiting in patients at hours 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24 after the surgery were recorded.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> The frequency of PONV in the LP and SP groups did not demonstrate statistically significant different (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003e; 0.05). Nevertheless the frequency of shoulder pain after 4 hours at the LP group compared with SP group was significantly different (<italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0.023).</p><p>
<bold><italic>Conclusions: </italic></bold>The use of low pressure gas compared to standard pressure gas to create pneumoperitoneum could not reduce the PONV whereas the frequency of shoulder pain in LP group was reduced. Low pressure gas was associated with reduction of surgeon visibility and subsequently more prolonged surgery duration. </p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key Words</title><kwd>Carbon dioxide</kwd><kwd>Cholecystectomy</kwd><kwd>Laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>Nausea</kwd><kwd>Pneumoperitoneum</kwd><kwd>Postoperative period</kwd><kwd>Pressure</kwd><kwd>Vomiting</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Laparoscopic cholecystectomy was introduced in 1992 as the gold standard intervention for gallstone operation.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> It can be associated with complications including dehydration, gastric aspiration and wound dehiscence.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup>

<bold><italic>Study design and population: </italic></bold>This double-blind trial was performed in a hospital affiliated to pain research center in Jundishapur University located in Ahvaz, Southwest Iran, from Dec. 2012 to Sep. 2013. A total of 50 women patients aged between 18 to 60 years old with acute cholecystitis were enrolled into the study. Exclusion criteria was defined as the patients who had cholangitis, history of motion sickness, malignancy, smoking, pregnancy and the patients who had received anti-emetic agents during the past 24 hours. Ethics Committee of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences approved the study. A consent Form was received from the patients prior to the study.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Intervention and measurement: </italic></bold>Fifty qualified patients were randomly allocated for elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy to receive either standard pressure gas (14-15 mmHg) (n=25) or low pressure gas (7-9 mmHg) (n=25). Randomization was performed based on Color Cards (Blue &#x00026; Red Cards).The patients belonged to class 1-2 in American Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA). All the laparoscopic cholecystectomies which performed by the same surgeon, standard monitoring and anesthetic management were standardized. Anesthesia was induced with: Midazolam 0.05 mg/kg, Fentanyl 2 mcg/kg, Thiopental 5 mg/kg and Cisatracurium 0.1 mg/kg. Mechanical ventilation was adjusted to maintain end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> tension 35-40 mmHg throughout the surgery. After induction of anesthesia, a nasogastric tube was passed into the stomach for suction and then removed. The patients were monitored for blood pressure and heart rate during the surgical procedure. At the end of the laparoscopic operations, surgeon was asked to state the quality of surgical field visualization. Also, when the patients were awake, questioner (who did not know the pressure gas) evaluated the nausea, vomiting and shoulder pain. The method used for pain control after operation was the infusion of Apotel 1 gr at recovery and repeat it after 6 hours and also, NSAIDs suppositories / PRN.</p><p>The patients were monitored for emetic symptoms within the first postoperative 24 hours for five times. Nausea and vomiting in patients were recorded at hours 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24, and after the surgery. Assessment of nausea intensity is difficult because the nausea is subjective, so in order to increase the accuracy of nausea assessment we used the visual analogue scale (VAS).<sup>9 </sup>According to VAS, the number &#x0201c;zero&#x0201d; indicates that the patient does not feel any nausea and number &#x0201c;10&#x0201d; represents that the most severe level of nausea perception. [ 0-1 (no nausea), 1-4 (mild) , 4-7 (moderate) and 7-10 (severe)] .Vomiting was estimated based on frequency of emetic episode per 24 hours.[1-2 (mild) , 3-4 (moderate) and more from 5 (severe)]. The patients with persisted nausea for more than 20-30 min received Ondansetron 4 mg and were excluded the study<bold>. </bold>Also, shoulder pain in recovery room and 4 hours after the surgery were examined.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Statistical considerations: </italic></bold>The power of this study was considered 80%. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 19. The results were shown as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation (SD) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of differences were calculated. We used Fisher exact and Chi Square tests to compare the variables between two groups. <italic>P </italic>&#x0003c; 0&#x000b7;05 was considered significant. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>There was no significant difference between two groups based on demographic characteristics and surgical data, (P&#x0003e;0.05) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table-I</xref>). The frequency of nausea and vomiting in patients at hours 0-4, 4-8, 8-12, 12-24, and after the surgery did not demonstrate statistically significant difference between LP and SP groups (P&#x0003c;0.05) (Tab2&#x00026;3). In this study, the total dose of antiemetic medication (Ondansetron) used for moderate or severe nausea and vomiting were 30.65 and 34.80 mg respectively. Regarding the shoulder pain, the patients were questioned while leaving the recovery room and 4 hours after the operation. When leaving the recovery room, 5 and 12 patients in the LP and SP groups complained of shoulder pain, the difference was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e; 0.023). Furthermore, 4 hours after the surgery, 3 and 9 patients in the LP and SP groups complained of shoulder pain, and the difference was significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003e; 0.005).

One of them is the dilation of brain vessels by CO<sub>2</sub> increasing intra cranial pressure (ICP) and consequently the possibility of nausea and vomiting.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> Clinical and laboratory studies have revealed that ICP elevation is not directly relevant to the hemodynamic changes caused by the increased intra-abdominal pressure. The possible mechanism of increased ICP associated with insufflation may be impaired venous drainage of the lumbar venous plexus following increased intra-abdominal pressure.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> PONV is affected by many factors which related to patients, surgery and anesthesia. These variable items requires 5-Hydroxytryptamin (5.HT) secretion in a cascade of events concluding both the central nervous system and Gastro-intestinal tract.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> In addition, serotonin may play a role in pathogenesis of PONV. Various other mechanisms have been proposed for PONV after laparoscopic, including the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on the occurrence of ischemia in visceral tissues.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> PONV is decreased with the administration of high concentration oxygen,<sup><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> fluid therapy,<sup><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> and sympathomimetic agents.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>Likewise Propofol usage for anesthesia preservation has a positive effect on PONV reduction when N<sub>2</sub>O is administered as the unique anesthetic agent, it is recognized to cause of PONV.
