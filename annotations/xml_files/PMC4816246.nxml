several vitamins and minerals, and the prevention of enteric infection.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup> However, gastric acid requires tight physiologic regulation and effective mucosal defense mechanisms in order to prevent damage to the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup></p><p>Acid-related diseases of the upper gastrointestinal tract encompass several conditions with distinctive, but overlapping, pathogenic mechanisms that occur when the normal balance between gastric acid (and pepsin) secretion and gastroduodenal mucosal defense mechanisms becomes disrupted.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref></sup> The common factor among these disorders is the excessive exposure of sensitive tissues to gastric acid, and the most common and well-defined disorders are gastroesophageal reflux disease and peptic ulcer disease.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> In gastroesophageal reflux disease, inappropriate reflux of gastric contents into the esophagus occurs, mainly due to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">4</xref></sup> This is one of the most common gastrointestinal disorders worldwide, with weekly symptoms experienced by between 5&#x00025; (East Asia) and 20&#x00025; (North America) of the population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">5</xref></sup> In peptic ulcer disease, the gastric or duodenal mucosal defenses become compromised due to various mechanisms, for instance <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> infection or excessive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) use.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref></sup> Although eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> has led to a decrease in <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positive ulcers, this has been offset by greater resistance to antibiotics and an increase in the prevalence of NSAID-induced ulcers and <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative/NSAID-negative ulcers.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup></p><p>Gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) is the key enzyme responsible for the final step of gastric acid secretion from stimulated parietal cells.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> Upon activation, the process of acid secretion requires recruitment of H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase from cytoplasmic tubules into the microvilli of the secretory canaliculus of the parietal cell.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> It pumps out H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> at a pH of 0.8 against a large concentration gradient (&#x0003e;10<sup>6</sup>-fold) by ATP-driven exchange of one H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup> for one K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">7</xref></sup> The H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase is able to maintain gastric juice at an acidic normal median fasting pH of 1.7 (range 0.3&#x02013;2.9) in the stomach, whereas prolonged exposure to even weakly acidic pH levels would be considered pathologic in the esophagus.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">9</xref></sup></p><p>Inhibition of gastric acid secretion remains the cornerstone of treatment for acid-related disorders.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">10</xref></sup> Current approaches to the treatment involve either preventing parietal cell stimulation using H2 receptor antagonists or inhibiting the gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase using proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> PPIs provide more effective symptom resolution and disease healing than H2 receptor antagonists.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> The current PPIs are prodrugs that require acid activation in the secretory canaliculus and irreversibly inhibit H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase activity.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup> However, agents that inhibit H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase via new modes of action are in development, most notably the potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs), which are stable and active in an acidic environment and inhibit the gastric H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase by reversible K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-competitive binding.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">6</xref></sup></p><p>TAK-438, 1-[5-(2-fluorophenyl)-1-(pyridin-3-ylsulfonyl)-1<italic>H</italic>-pyrrol-3-yl]-<italic>N</italic>-methylmethanamine monofumarate, (vonoprazan) is a potent, novel, orally active P-CAB discovered by Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Ltd, Japan and selected as a candidate for development as a treatment for acid-related diseases.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref></sup> This water-soluble pyrrole derivative has a significantly different chemical structure than other P-CABs and, importantly, lacks the imidazopyridine ring structure that could be linked to liver enzyme elevation observed in some earlier investigations of P-CABs in man.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup> Preclinical data suggest that TAK-438 provides more profound and longer-lasting suppression of gastric acid secretion compared with either PPIs or other P-CABs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> This appears to be a consequence of the following: (1) high accumulation in gastric glands due to its high pK<sub>a</sub> (relative to PPIs and other P-CABs) and (2) slow clearance from gastric glands and its slower dissociation from H<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>,K<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>-ATPase once bound (relative to other P-CABs).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup></p><p>Acid-related diseases remain a major healthcare problem and unmet needs persist, despite the improvements in management provided by the PPIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">20</xref></sup> The majority of currently approved PPIs need to be taken before meals, have a slow, cumulative onset of action over several days of dosing, and do not always sufficiently inhibit acid secretion at night.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref></sup> At the time of conducting these phase I studies, the preclinical profile of TAK-438 suggested that it has many characteristics that could address these unmet needs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref></sup> Because of its gastric tissue accumulation, slow clearance, and acid independence, it should be possible to take TAK-438 without regard to meal time and it would be expected to provide a rapid onset of action from the first dose, as well as preventing nocturnal acid break-through and reducing acid reflux symptoms.</p><p>In addition, PPIs' acid-suppressive efficacy varies due to polymorphisms in the hepatic cytochrome that affect their metabolism, whereas TAK-438 is metabolized mainly by CYP3A4 (and not CYP2C19) and may have less inter-patient variability.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">21</xref></sup> In this article, we describe the results of two phase I studies investigating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single rising doses of TAK-438 in healthy male subjects in Japan and the UK. These studies provide the first clinical evidence to support the potential of this novel P-CAB as a treatment for acid-related diseases.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Subjects were enrolled in one of two similarly designed phase I, single rising-dose, randomized, double-blind, single-center, placebo-controlled studies to evaluate the single-dose safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of TAK-438 at oral doses of 1, 5, 10, 15 (UK only), 20, 30 (UK only), 40, 80 (Japan only), and 120&#x02009;mg (Japan only) in healthy male subjects at the Medical Co. LTA Honjo Clinic in Japan (seven cohorts) and at Richmond Pharmacology Ltd, St George's University of London in the UK (seven cohorts). The Japanese study was conducted between 10 September 2007 and 14 December 2007 and the UK study between 21 October 2007 and 28 February 2008.</p><p>In the Japanese study, each cohort comprised 12 subjects randomized to TAK-438 (<italic>n</italic>=9) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>=3). In both studies, the investigator recruited subjects from a database of healthy volunteers maintained by the investigational site. Each cohort comprised nine subjects randomized to TAK-438 (<italic>n</italic>=6) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>=3). Placebo was administered using the same number of tablets required to achieve the TAK-438 dose within each cohort.</p><p>The studies were reviewed and approved by their respective ethics committees and were conducted in accordance with the Good Clinical Practice guideline, all applicable local regulations, and the 1996 Declaration of Helsinki. The Japanese ethics committee approved the protocol on 18 August 2007 and an updated protocol on 22 September 2007. The UK ethics committee EC approved the protocol on 14 September 2007, Amendment 001 to the protocol on 20 September 2007, and Amendments 002, 003, and Revised 003 on 28 January 2008.

No food was permitted for 4&#x02009;h post dose, but 200&#x02009;ml water was given at 2 and 4&#x02009;h post dose.</p><p>The objective of the single-dose escalation scheme was to escalate to the maximum tolerated dose or to a maximum area under the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve (AUC) for TAK-438. The starting dose was 1&#x02009;mg TAK-438 and the decision to proceed to the next dose in the next cohort was made after blinded review of 24-h safety and pharmacokinetic data from the preceding cohort. The next cohort was dosed only if the preceding dose level had been well tolerated (both studies) and if the predicted mean exposure at the next dose level did not exceed the no-observed-adverse-effect level AUC in dogs (UK criterion only). The different doses were chosen following agreement with the respective regulatory authorities.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Participants had to be healthy adult Japanese males aged 20&#x02013;45 years (Japan) or Western non-Japanese males aged 18&#x02013;45 years (UK), with a body weight &#x02265;50&#x02009;kg (Japan), and body mass index 18.5&#x02013;25.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (Japan) or 18.0&#x02013;30.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> (UK) at screening.

All pharmacokinetic parameters (except <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) were log-transformed before analysis.</p><p>The pharmacodynamic analysis set comprised all subjects who received TAK-438 on day 1 and who had sufficient intragastric pH data. In the Japanese study, insufficient gastric pH data was defined as an outlier (0.0 or &#x02265;10.0) within any 10-min period or missing pH data at one or more out of 12 time points and the individual subject was excluded from pharmacokinetic analyses. Subjects with outliers or missing pH data at less than one out of 12 time points of the 24- or 12-h period were included in the summary; however, the missing or outlier data were excluded. The average pH value was calculated by subject from the data collected during each monitoring period. The device used in the UK study was very reliable and standard calibration was performed before and after the recordings. If a significant interruption of the pH monitoring occurred, this was indicative of an irreversible mechanical break in the catheter and no data were recorded from this point.</p><p>Descriptive statistics were used to summarize pH HTRs, mean pH, and serum concentrations of gastrin and pepsinogen I and II in each treatment group. Primary safety analyses and baseline demographic summaries were performed on the safety analysis set (i.e., all subjects who were enrolled and received a single dose of TAK-438 or placebo on day 1).

The results of both studies were comparable and so are reviewed together in this section.</p><p>TAK-438 was safe and well tolerated at all doses tested (1&#x02013;120&#x02009;mg), with no adverse events reported in Japanese subjects and only 12 treatment-emergent adverse events in the 10 subjects in the UK study. There were no serious adverse events in either study. Plasma concentrations of TAK-438 increased slightly more than dose proportionally. Saturation of first-pass metabolism may contribute to the non-linearity of the plasma pharmacokinetics. Median <italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub> of TAK-438 was &#x02264;2&#x02009;h and estimated mean terminal elimination half-life was &#x02264;9&#x02009;h. The combination of the mechanism of action (direct activity on the acid pump) and median plasma half-life of TAK-438 is noteworthy compared with the indirect mechanism of action and very short half-lives of PPIs.</p><p>The intragastric pH&#x02013;time parameters showed dose-dependent acid suppression at doses of 20&#x02013;120&#x02009;mg over the entire 24-h period, with a clear dose&#x02013;response relationship for pH &#x02265;4 and pH &#x02265;5 HTR. The 24-h pH &#x02265;4 HTR was broadly similar for the Japanese and UK subjects, suggesting no substantial differences based on region, although the pH &#x02265;5 HTR was more divergent. Small differences between the studies could be related to the small study population and differences in ethnic demographics and physiology. For example, Asian people typically have a greater response to acid-suppressing drugs, including PPIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> Efficacy of PPI treatment in Asian compared with Caucasian populations appears to be influenced by variability in the metabolism of drugs (CYP2C19 polymorphisms), high <italic>H. pylori</italic> prevalence, a lower parietal cell mass, and lower acid output (even after correcting for body weight, sex, and age).<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">25</xref></sup> This could also be extrapolated to Japanese people.</p><p>The 24-h pH HTR reported in our studies (pH &#x02265;4 HTR with TAK-438 40&#x02009;mg: 92&#x00025; (Japan) and 87&#x00025; (UK)) suggests superior acid suppression with TAK-438 than that reported with PPIs.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">26</xref></sup> It is also worth emphasizing that this high level of acid suppression with TAK-438 occurred after just a single dose, showing a rapid onset. The nighttime pH HTR (pH &#x02265;4 HTR with TAK-438 40&#x02009;mg: 100&#x00025; 12&#x02013;24&#x02009;h post dose in the Japan study, and 90&#x00025; from ~20:00&#x02013;08:00 in the UK study) also indicate potential superiority over PPIs (nighttime pH &#x02265;4 HTR up to 72&#x00025; depending upon dose and timing.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">28</xref></sup> This finding is of particular interest for the management of patients with nighttime acid reflux.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref></sup></p><p>It is generally accepted that suppressing gastric acid secretion enhances healing of damage associated with acid-related disorders, with better healing achieved when intragastric pH &#x0003e;4 is sustained for as long a duration as possible.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">30</xref></sup> Furthermore, in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy, the role of antisecretory agents is to increase the intragastric pH.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">31</xref></sup> Therefore, the better acid control with TAK-438 (pH&#x02265;5 HTR with 40&#x02009;mg dose: 91&#x00025; (Japan) and 70&#x00025; (UK)) and a faster onset of acid suppression than that seen with PPIs could increase the efficacy (earlier onset of effect) of antibiotics in <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">36</xref></sup></p><p>An exploratory analysis of the dose-normalized pharmacokinetic parameters plotted against the CYP2C19 genotype from Japanese data indicated no tendency for CYP2C19 genotype to increase or decrease pharmacokinetic parameters, suggesting that TAK-438 may offer consistently profound and sustained efficacy regardless of CYP2C19 status. This is in contrast to PPIs, which appear to vary in efficacy and in potential for drug&#x02013;drug interactions depending on patients' CYP2C19 status.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">38</xref></sup></p><p>TAK-438 is estimated to be excreted in the urine within 48&#x02009;h after study drug administration. The urinary excretion of TAK-438 in the 48-h period after study drug administration indicated a dose-dependent increase for TAK-438 doses of 1&#x02013;120&#x02009;mg (Japan) and 1&#x02013;40&#x02009;mg (UK) and is estimated to be excreted within 48&#x02009;h.</p><p>In these studies, mean serum gastrin and pepsinogen concentrations were increased above placebo concentrations at most TAK-438 doses. However, mean gastrin levels were within the expected range and increased to similar levels to those observed with PPI therapy (200&#x02013;400&#x02009;pg/ml)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">41</xref></sup> The levels observed for pepsinogen I and II did not indicate corpus atrophy for any subjects at any of the dose levels. Unlike other P-CABs, such as AZD0865, TAK-438 did not increase serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations, probably due to distinct differences in its chemical structure.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">15</xref></sup></p><p>The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic findings after a single dose in these healthy volunteer studies demonstrate a rapid and profound inhibition of gastric acid secretion that was well sustained over a 24-h period and suggest that TAK-438 may prove to be beneficial for the treatment of patients with acid-related disorders. These results support those observed in preclinical animal studies and were predicted based on the compound's high accumulation.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">19</xref></sup></p><p>Nevertheless, findings of the present studies should be considered in light of their practical limitations, including the relatively small study populations of healthy volunteers and minor methodological differences between the Japanese and UK studies, such as different imposed regional dose ranges.</p><p>In conclusion, TAK-438 produced rapid, profound, and sustained suppression of gastric acid secretion at single oral doses of 20&#x02013;120&#x02009;mg, regardless of CYP2C19 status and region, and was well tolerated in healthy male subjects in two phase I studies. The 24-h intragastric pH HTRs showed dose-dependent acid suppression, with pH &#x02265;4 HTR &#x02265;87&#x00025; and nighttime pH &#x02265;4 HTR &#x02265;90&#x00025; following a single dose of 40&#x02009;mg. TAK-438 may, therefore, represent an efficacious, safe, and well tolerated alternative to PPIs for the treatment of acid-related disorders, particularly in preventing nocturnal acid break-through and reducing acid reflux symptoms.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Highlights</title><p><inline-graphic xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="ctg201518i1.jpg"/></p></sec></body><back><notes><p><bold>Guarantor of the article</bold>: Yuuichi Sakurai, MSc.</p><p><bold>Specific author contributions</bold>: A.N., K.A., H.J., G.K., M.H., and Y.S. were involved in the study concept and design.
