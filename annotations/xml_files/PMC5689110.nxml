Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio by using an interactive voice/web-response system to low-dose aripiprazole (5&#x02009;mg/day if &#x0003c;50&#x02009;kg; 10&#x02009;mg/day if &#x02265;50&#x02009;kg), high-dose aripiprazole (10&#x02009;mg/day if &#x0003c;50&#x02009;kg; 20&#x02009;mg/day if &#x02265;50&#x02009;kg), or placebo for 8 weeks. Randomization was stratified by region (North America or Europe) and baseline body weight (&#x0003c;50&#x02009;kg vs. &#x02265;50&#x02009;kg). The primary efficacy endpoint was mean change from baseline to week 8 in the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale Total Tic Score (YGTSS-TTS) for the intent-to-treat population.</p><p><bold><italic>Results:</italic></bold> Between November 2012 and May 2013, 133 patients were recruited and randomized to low-dose aripiprazole (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;44), high-dose aripiprazole (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;45), or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;44). Least-squares mean treatment differences versus placebo in change from baseline to week 8 in the YGTSS-TTS were statistically significant (high dose, &#x02212;9.9 [95% confidence interval, CI, &#x02212;13.8 to &#x02212;5.9], low dose, &#x02212;6.3 [95% CI, &#x02212;10.2 to &#x02212;2.3]). At week 8, 69% (29/42) of patients in the low-dose and 74% (26/35) of patients in the high-dose aripiprazole groups demonstrated a Clinical Global Impression&#x02013;Tourette's Syndrome improvement score of 1 (very much improved) or 2 (much improved) compared with 38% (16/42) in the placebo group. The most common adverse events (AEs) were sedation (low dose, 8/44 [18.2%], high dose, 4/45 [8.9%], placebo, 1/44 [2.3%]), somnolence (low dose, 5/44 [11.4%], high dose, 7/45 [15.6%], placebo, 1/44 [2.3%]), and fatigue (low dose, 3/44 [6.8%], high dose, 7/45 [15.6%], placebo, 0).

The most severe tics occur between 6 and 15 years of age and can negatively affect quality of life (e.g., social and academic functioning) (Leckman et al. <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Cutler et al. <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). For &#x0003e;30 years, haloperidol and pimozide were the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)&#x02013;approved pharmacotherapies for TD (US Food and Drug Administration <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">1984</xref>; Haloperidol tablet <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) that led to off-label use of atypical antipsychotics along with behavior therapies (e.g., habit reversal therapy), for symptom relief (Dutta and Cavanna <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 (US Food and Drug Administration <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), with origins from advocates for TD, was created to stimulate the development of new, verified treatments for rare diseases such as TD. Aripiprazole received orphan designation from the FDA for &#x0201c;treatment of Tourette's Syndrome.&#x0201d;</p><p>Although the exact pathogenesis of TD is unknown, atypical antipsychotics became a part of the treatment paradigm because dopaminergic and serotonergic disturbances were implicated (Steeves and Fox <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). The atypical antipsychotic aripiprazole is a dopamine D<sub>2</sub>- and serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)<sub>1A</sub> receptor partial agonist and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor antagonist (Abilify<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2016) that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of TD. Efficacy was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled clinical study that enrolled patients who were 6&#x02013;18 years of age (Yoo et al. <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Aripiprazole is also indicated for children and adolescents with schizophrenia (ages 13&#x02013;17), bipolar I disorder (ages 10&#x02013;17), and irritability associated with autistic disorder (ages 6&#x02013;17) (Abilify<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2016).</p><p>In previous small (e.g., <italic>n</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;100) or uncontrolled studies in patients with TD, treatment with oral aripiprazole demonstrated efficacy in the suppression of tics while being generally well tolerated (Yoo et al. <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rizzo et al. <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wenzel et al. <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Here, we present results from the largest multinational, double-blind study to date that evaluated the efficacy and safety of oral aripiprazole in children and adolescents with TD and was part of the clinical evidence for the FDA approval of aripiprazole.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s003"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that included patients from hospitals, private practices, and research clinics at 76 sites in the United States, Canada, Hungary, and Italy (NCT01727700; list of investigators who screened or enrolled patients available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Data</xref>; Supplementary Data are available online at <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.liebertpub.com/cap">www.liebertpub.com/cap</uri>).

Patients with a history of psychotic disorders and those with primary mood disorders (DSM-IV-TR), other neurologic disorders that may have accompanying abnormal movements, autism spectrum disorder, or severe obsessive-compulsive disorder were excluded. Also excluded were patients taking psychostimulants for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder who experienced new or exacerbated treatment-related tics and those with a psychoactive-substance use disorder within the previous three months (DSM-IV-TR) and/or a positive drug screen.

The study sponsor's biostatistics department provided the random allocation schedule that was designed to assign patients in a 1:1:1 ratio to a treatment regimen by using a block size of three. Blinding was achieved by using placebo tablets that were identical in appearance to the aripiprazole tablets. Treatment assignment codes were available only to an independent biostatistician. Except in cases of emergency unblinding, patients, investigational site personnel, study sponsors, and all other trial personnel remained blinded to treatment assignments.</p><p>The study included a pretreatment phase for a maximum of 42 days in length with screening and washout (where applicable), and a treatment phase with baseline visit on day 0. On treatment phase completion, patients could enter an open-label study; those who discontinued the trial or who did not enter into the open-label extension were followed for 30&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><fig id="f1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label><bold>FIG. 1.</bold></label><caption><p>Study design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="fig-1"/></fig><p>Treatment with aripiprazole was initiated at 2&#x02009;mg/day and then increased to 5&#x02009;mg/day after 2 days of treatment. Thereafter, patients &#x0003c;50&#x02009;kg who were randomized to low-dose aripiprazole remained on 5&#x02009;mg/day, whereas patients &#x02265;50&#x02009;kg and patients in the high-dose groups had their daily doses increased stepwise by 5&#x02009;mg/day at the end of each week of treatment until they reached their target randomized dose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. S1</xref>). The target dose for patients &#x0003c;50&#x02009;kg was 5&#x02009;mg/day (low dose) or 10&#x02009;mg/day (high dose). The target dose for patients &#x02265;50&#x02009;kg was 10&#x02009;mg/day (low dose) and 20&#x02009;mg/day (high dose). If the randomized dose was not tolerated, a one-time dose reduction to the next lower dose level or to 2&#x02009;mg/day for the 5-mg/day group was permitted.</p><p>Clinic visits were scheduled at the start of weeks 1, 2 (&#x000b1;1 day), 4, 6, and 8 (&#x000b1;3 days), when efficacy, safety, and other outcomes were assessed. Telephone calls to parents or guardians of patients were made at the start of weeks 3, 5, and 7 (&#x000b1;1 day) to confirm safety and tolerability.</p></sec><sec id="s006"><title>Outcomes</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the YGTSS-TTS mean change from baseline to week 8. The YGTSS is a semi-structured scale that measures tic severity within the previous week. The YGTSS-TTS is a summation of motor and vocal tic severity scores (scale: 0&#x02013;5) across five dimensions: number, frequency, intensity, complexity, and interference (Leckman et al. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). The YGTSS also includes an impairment rating scale that focuses on psychosocial aspects (Leckman et al. <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint were based on age (7&#x02013;12 years vs. 13&#x02013;17 years), baseline YGTSS-TTS (&#x0003c;30 vs. &#x02265;30), and region (North America or Europe). All raters were trained on the YGTSS by ProPhase, LLC (New York, NY) in face-to-face training. A rater certificate was granted on meeting inter-rater reliability standards. Raters were re-assessed every 6 months after they received their initial certificate.</p><p>The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the week 8 Clinical Global Impression&#x02013;Tourette's Syndrome (CGI-TS) improvement scale score. Additional efficacy outcomes included a mean change from baseline to week 8 in total YGTSS score and CGI-TS severity score, response rates (&#x0003e;25% improvement from baseline to endpoint in YGTSS-TTS or a CGI-TS improvement score of 1 [very much improved] or 2 [much improved]), and treatment discontinuation rates. A more stringent <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of response, defined as percentage of patients with &#x0003e;50% improvement from baseline on YGTSS&#x02013;TTS, was also performed. Additional <italic>post hoc</italic> efficacy outcomes included change from baseline in YGTSS total motor tic score, total vocal tic score, and impairment score.</p><p>Other outcomes (described briefly in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>) included Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham-IV rating scale (SNAP-IV; assesses inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, and oppositional defiant symptoms), Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R), and Pediatric Anxiety Rating Scale (PARS) scores.</p><p>Safety and tolerability endpoints included treatment-emergent adverse events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms, body weight, and clinical laboratory tests. The mean change in weight from baseline at the end-of-treatment visit was calculated, and a potentially clinically relevant weight change was defined as &#x02265;7% increase or decrease from baseline. The Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), the Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS) assessed extrapyramidal symptoms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>). The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) evaluated suicidality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Table S2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s007"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample size was estimated at 126 patients to provide &#x02265;80% power to detect a treatment difference (standard deviation, SD) of &#x02212;5 (8.5) between placebo and at least one out of two aripiprazole doses in the primary endpoint. Efficacy was analyzed in all randomized patients (intent-to-treat [ITT] population) and in randomized patients with no major protocol violations (per-protocol population). Prespecified major protocol violations included &#x0003c;80% compliance with the investigational medicine product and use of prohibited medication that had a potential effect on efficacy evaluation.</p><p>The primary efficacy and key secondary endpoints, including subgroup and subscale analyses, were analyzed by using a mixed-model repeated-measures (MMRM) linear model (time variable: visit week) with statistical significance at alpha level 0.05 (two-sided) and treatment, region, weight group, and visit week as factors; baseline YGTSS-TTS as a covariate (for the primary efficacy endpoint); and treatment-by-week interactions in the model. The Hochberg procedure was used to adjust for multiplicity in testing two comparisons (low- or high-dose aripiprazole vs. placebo) of the primary and key secondary endpoints. If both doses demonstrated statistically significant improvements compared with placebo for the primary endpoint, then the key secondary endpoint was tested with comparisons for both doses versus placebo. Adjustments were not made for multiple comparisons over time (i.e., by treatment week).</p><p>Changes from baseline to week 8 in total YGTSS and CGI-TS severity scores were summarized by using descriptive statistics and compared between aripiprazole groups and placebo by fitting an MMRM linear model to the change scores (reported as least squares [LS] means). The repeated-measures generalized linear model was used to analyze the ordinal responses of CGI Improvement and the change from baseline in CGI Severity, respectively. Fixed categorical effects included treatment, week, treatment-by-week interaction, region, weight group, and baseline CGI severity score, and week was the time variable for repeated measures.</p><p>Response rates, including the <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of proportion of patients with &#x0003e;50% improvement from baseline in YGTSS-TTS, were analyzed by using observed case data, and treatment discontinuation rates were analyzed by using all randomized patients; both adjusted for region and weight group by using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel method. No multiplicity adjustments were applied to any of the other efficacy endpoints (i.e., <italic>p</italic>-values unadjusted for multiplicity were reported). Pre-specified (a priori) statistical analyses were performed by using SAS version 9.3; SAS version 9.4 was used for <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses.</p><p>Patients in the ITT population who received &#x02265;1 dose of study medication were analyzed for safety (safety population). C-SSRS scores and AEs were analyzed by using descriptive statistics. SNAP-IV, CY-BOCS, CDRS-R, PARS, SAS, AIMS, and BARS scores were also analyzed by using an MMRM linear model.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s008"><title>Results</title><p>Of the 171 patients screened between November 2012 and May 2013, 133 were randomized at 76 sites in four countries: the United States (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;92), Canada (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;27), Hungary (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;9), and Italy (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;5).

Overall, for the safety sample, the mean change in weight (kg, SD) from baseline to week 8 was 1.8 (2.0), 1.0 (2.0), and 0.6 (2.1) in the low-dose aripiprazole, high-dose aripiprazole, and placebo groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s009"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study demonstrated the efficacy of high-dose and low-dose aripiprazole for the treatment of tics in children and adolescents with TD. Improvements in the primary (YGTSS-TTS) and key secondary (CGI-TS improvement scale score) endpoints were observed as early as week 1 of treatment and were sustained throughout the study. Overall, a 45.9% and 54.2% decrease from baseline in YGTSS-TTS was observed with low- and high-dose aripiprazole, respectively. This magnitude of change (&#x0003e;25%) is predictive of a CGI improvement scale score of 1 or 2 (very much improved or much improved) based on a pooled analysis of two 10-week studies comparing behavioral interventions in patients with TD (mean age, 22.0 years) (Jeon et al. <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). For all efficacy endpoints, with the exception of the CGI-TS improvement and severity scale scores, the magnitude of improvement was dose related (i.e., greater improvements with high- vs. low-dose aripiprazole).</p><p>Analyses using the more stringent <italic>post hoc</italic> defined response rate were consistent with results from the a priori defined response rate, demonstrating that a greater percentage of patients treated with low- or high-dose oral aripiprazole achieved &#x0003e;50% improvement in YGTSS-TTS at week 8 compared with the patients in the placebo group. Of note, when using the more stringent response criteria, the response ratio versus placebo was higher than that using the less stringent a priori defined response rate. The higher response ratio versus placebo using the more stringent criteria reflects the higher placebo response rate using a priori criteria.</p><p>Improvements at week 8 on the YGTSS-TTS motor tic, vocal tic, and impairment scores were greater in the low- and high-dose aripiprazole groups versus placebo. These findings are consistent with results for the primary endpoint, and they indicate that improvements in all three components contribute to the overall primary outcome. Improvements versus placebo on the primary endpoint were significant in the low-dose and high-dose aripiprazole groups in North America and only in the low-dose aripiprazole group in Europe. The small sample sizes in the rest of the Europe stratum (range for <italic>n'</italic>s at week 8: 3&#x02013;5) do not allow for reliable inferences to be made; study sample size estimates did not take into account power calculations for subgroup analyses.</p><p>Oral aripiprazole was generally well tolerated. Symptoms associated with psychiatric comorbidities did not worsen with aripiprazole treatment. Although a greater proportion of patients exhibited extrapyramidal symptoms with aripiprazole, only one patient reported parkinsonian resting tremor (in the high-dose group); nevertheless, mean SAS and AIMS scores improved significantly in the high-dose group versus placebo. The improvement in SAS scores in the aripiprazole groups may partially reflect fewer tics with aripiprazole treatment.</p><p>Results from this trial complement other studies of aripiprazole for the treatment of TD. The efficacy of aripiprazole was recently demonstrated in a 10-week study in 61 Korean children with TD, with significant reductions from baseline to study end in YGTSS-TTS and CGI-TS Severity of Illness score versus placebo (Yoo et al. <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Further, in a case series of 100 patients with TD (mean age, 27.1 years), aripiprazole treatment considerably reduced tic severity in 82% of patients, with 99% of patients reporting positive results (Wenzel et al. <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). These two studies, along with a third study that assessed aripiprazole's metabolic effect in children (mean age, 11.0 years), reported aripiprazole to be safe for use in children and adolescents with TD (Yoo et al. <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Rizzo et al. <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Wenzel et al. <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>The AEs observed in this trial are consistent with other pediatric studies of oral aripiprazole in schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, and autistic disorder (Findling et al. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Marcus et al. <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Owen et al. <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). Although a higher rate of discontinuations was observed with high-dose aripiprazole versus low-dose aripiprazole or placebo, this rate was consistent with short-term (i.e., 4&#x02013;8 weeks) pediatric studies of oral aripiprazole (mean ages, 9.3&#x02013;15.4 years) at doses of 5-, 10-, 15-, or 30&#x02009;mg/day (discontinuation rates, 13.0%&#x02013;22.2%) (Findling et al. <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Marcus et al. <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Owen et al. <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and a 4-week risperidone trial in pediatric and adult patients (mean age, 24.7 years) with TD (discontinuation rate, 21.0%) (Bruun and Budman <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">1996</xref>). Overall, the AE profile reported in this trial demonstrates that oral aripiprazole is safe for use in children and adolescents with TD and may potentially be better tolerated than other approved treatments for tic disorders (e.g., haloperidol) (Shapiro et al. <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">1973</xref>; Sallee et al. <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>).</p><p>Other atypical antipsychotics, including quetiapine (Copur et al. <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Huys et al. <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and risperidone (Huys et al. <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), have consistently reported efficacy for the treatment of tics. Quetiapine treatment resulted in a 65% and 74% reduction in the tic severity at weeks 4 and 8, respectively (Copur et al. <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Patients treated for 8 weeks with risperidone showed a 32% reduction in tic severity from baseline compared with a 7% reduction with placebo (Scahill et al. <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). However, safety concerns remain, including weight gain, fatigue, and overall tolerability with these drugs. Different antipsychotics differ in their potential to induce side effects such as weight gain and cardiovascular risks; aripiprazole has a low potential to induce metabolic side effects, but as with other second-generation antipsychotics, regular monitoring is warranted (De Hert et al. <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Guidelines for the treatment of tic disorders recommend a hierarchical, multimodal approach (Roessner et al. <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Pringsheim et al. <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Murphy et al. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Patients should be carefully evaluated for coexisting conditions, and initial treatment selection should prioritize the condition causing the most impairment, which in some cases may be a comorbid psychiatric disorder (Roessner et al. <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Murphy et al. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Treatment guidelines recommend consideration of both behavioral and pharmacologic approaches (Roessner et al. <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Verdellen et al. <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Pringsheim et al. <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Steeves et al. <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Murphy et al. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The randomized controlled Comprehensive Behavioral Intervention for Tics (C-BIT) study, which evaluated a behavioral intervention based on habit reversal, demonstrated a 7.6-point reduction in YGTSS-TTS after 10 weeks of treatment, a significant improvement over the 3.5-point reduction attained with the control treatment (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001; effect size, 0.68) (Piacentini et al. <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>).</p><p>There are no studies directly comparing C-BIT or other forms of habit reversal therapy with pharmacologic or combined therapies in youth with TD. However, based on its demonstrated effectiveness and low risk of adverse effects, habit reversal is recommended as a first-line treatment option (Pringsheim et al. <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Steeves et al. <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Comparative studies of behavioral and pharmacologic approaches could advance the therapeutics of TD and extend the reach of treatment guidelines. Currently, however, a careful appraisal of risk-benefit profiles as well as preference and availability can guide physicians in selecting the most appropriate treatment modality for their patient (Pringsheim et al. <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Steeves et al. <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Murphy et al. <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>This study was one of the studies that led to the approval of aripiprazole by the FDA for the treatment of TD. Dosing adjustments were recommended in the <italic>US Prescribing Information</italic> based on the results from this study. For patients weighing &#x0003c;50&#x02009;kg, the recommended initiation dose is 2&#x02009;mg/day, with a target of 5&#x02009;mg/day and a maximum dose of 10&#x02009;mg/day. For patients weighing &#x02265;50&#x02009;kg, it is recommended to initiate dosing at 2&#x02009;mg/day and increase it to 10&#x02009;mg/day on day 8, with the maximum dose being 20&#x02009;mg/day (Abilify<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2016).</p><p>To date, this study is the largest double-blind, placebo-controlled, multinational trial in children and adolescents with TD. Relative to some phase 3 trials in other disease states, this sample size was small, and this study was not powered to detect statistically significant treatment differences within subgroups. However, it is difficult to recruit children and adolescents for clinical trials, and the potential study population is much smaller for rare diseases. Future research studies should consider primary analyses of patient subgroups (e.g., comorbid conditions) or pooling data across trials to obtain greater power to detect treatment differences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s010"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our findings support the efficacy and safety of aripiprazole for children and adolescents with TD.

Overall, a 45.9% and 54.2% decrease from baseline in total tic score was observed with low- and high-dose aripiprazole, respectively. A consistent and significantly greater response rate versus placebo was observed in both aripiprazole dose groups by using both standard and more stringent definitions of response. These results are consistent with findings from other smaller studies and studies performed in other regions of the world (e.g., Asia) in children and adolescents with TD. The U.S. FDA approval of oral aripiprazole in December 2014 provided a new option for the first time in &#x0003e;30 years for the treatment of tics in children and adolescents with TD. Oral aripiprazole might be considered a suitable treatment option for patients and caregivers with tolerability concerns.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplemental data</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip" xlink:href="Supp_Data.zip" orientation="portrait" xlink:type="simple" id="d38e2556" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><sec id="s012" sec-type="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The initial draft of this article was written by Jessica Holzhauer, DVM, with assistance from Amy Roth Shaberman, PhD, medical writers from C4 MedSolutions, LLC (Yardley, PA), a CHC Group company, with funding from Otsuka Pharmaceutical Development &#x00026; Commercialization, Inc.</p></sec><sec id="s013"><title>Authors' Contributions</title><p>The corresponding author had full access to all the data in the study and had final responsibility for the decision to submit it for publication.
