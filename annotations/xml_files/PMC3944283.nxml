training on lower limb muscle activity and static balance of chronic stroke patients.
[Subjects] The subjects were twenty-five inpatients receiving physical therapy for chronic
stroke. [Methods] The chronic stroke patients were divided into two groups: thirteen
patients were assigned to the ankle-foot orthosis group, while the remaining twelve
patients wore only their shoes. Each group performed balance training for 20 minutes,
twice per day, 5 days per week, for 6 weeks. The lower limb muscle activities of the
paralyzed side tibialis anterior, medial gastrocnemius, and the stability index were
measured before and after the 6-week intervention. [Results] Comparison of the groups
indicated a significant difference in the muscle activity of the paralyzed side tibialis
anterior and the stability index of the eyes-open standing position. After the
intervention, the ankle-foot orthosis group evidenced a significant difference in the
muscle activities of the paralyzed side tibialis anterior and paralyzed side medial
gastrocnemius as well as the stability index of the eyes-open standing position,
eyes-closed standing position, eyes-open standing position on a sponge, and eyes-closed
standing position on a sponge. The group that only wore their shoes showed significant
differences in the stability indexes of eyes-open standing and eyes-open standing on a
sponge. [Conclusion] Using the ankle-foot orthosis was effective during the initial
training of lower limb muscle activities and the static balance training of chronic stroke
patients. However, it was not effective for a variety of dynamic situations.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Ankle-foot orthosis</kwd><kwd>Lower limb muscle activity</kwd><kwd>Static balance</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Stroke patients are characterized by an asymmetric posture due to decreased movement, and
this asymmetric posture makes balance control in a standing posture difficult, as a result
of the center of pressure moving toward the lower limb of the unaffected side, triggering
problems with postural control ability<xref rid="r1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><sup>)</sup>.
Loss of balance ability in stroke patients may cause increased postural sway, reduction of
weight on the lower limb of the affected side, and increased fall risk<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>In general, balance or postural stability refers to maintaining the center of mass within
the support surface to maintain static action and to perform desired motions. Balance
ability is essential for functional activities, as well as for actions such as sitting,
standing, and walking<xref rid="r3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><sup>)</sup>. To maintain and
adjust balance, the proprioceptive, visual, and vestibular senses must interact<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, 65% of stroke patients experience
loss of tactile and proprioceptive senses, largely because of impaired in proprioception
resulting from lowered muscle tone<xref rid="r5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Various methods exist to resolve problems of balance of stroke patients. These include
therapeutic exercises, such as weight shifting to the lower limb of the affected side,
proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation techniques, Bobath techniques, neurodevelopmental
facilitation techniques, and task-oriented exercises<xref rid="r6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,
<xref rid="r7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><sup>)</sup>. Repetitive exercise is necessary to
improve balance, and ankle-foot orthoses are used for hours when there is excessive
spasticity or deformity. Ankle orthoses stabilize the ankle joint and compensate for
insufficient ankle dorsiflexion and mediolateral instability of the subtalar joint,
increasing balance ability. They also facilitate medial shift of the center of mass and
weight shift toward the foot of the affected side, reducing asymmetric body posture<xref rid="r8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>Dysfunction of the foot and the ankle joint of stroke patients are closely associated with
functional and kinetic aspects of the lumbar region and lower limbs, inevitably triggering
overall body imbalance<xref rid="r9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><sup>)</sup>. The ankle joint
and the hip joint play important roles in providing body stability during stroke patients&#x02019;
balance training. The first type of postural control strategy is the ankle joint strategy,
which primarily improves standing balance through muscle contraction of the ankle joint<xref rid="r10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>While walking with an ankle-foot orthosis, the moment of the dorsiflexion angle during the
stance phase and plantarflexion during the terminal stance may increase<xref rid="r11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><sup>)</sup>. In a static standing position, the ankle joint is used
frequently<xref rid="r12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><sup>)</sup>, and according to
comparisons of muscular strength between those who have experienced falls and those who have
not, the extensors of the hip joint and the plantar flexor of the ankle joint show
significant differences<xref rid="r13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><sup>)</sup>, indicating
that loss of balance ability is closely related to the weakening of ankle strength<xref rid="r14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><sup>)</sup>. Therefore, the purpose of this study was
to examine the effects of balance training with an ankle-foot orthosis on stroke patients&#x02019;
lower limb muscle activities and static balance maintenance.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>SUBJECTS AND METHODS</title><p>The subjects of this study were 25 stroke patients, and they were randomly assigned to a

Prior to participation in this study, the purpose was explained to the
subjects and their guardians, and they consented to participate voluntarily. The research
and development review board for human subjects of Hallym University approved this study.
All procedures conformed to the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki. Inclusion
criteria were: a diagnosis of stroke within the previous 6&#x02013;12 months; no evidence of
vestibular system disorders, neurological deficits in the bilateral lower limbs, or visual
or auditory disorders; a mini&#x02013;mental state examination-Korean score of 23 or higher; a Berg
Balance Scale score of 40 or higher without any musculoskeletal deficit that affected
standing balance; and agreement to wear a plastic ankle-foot orthosis of the plantar flexion
90&#x000b0; ankle stop-type.</p><p>A Tele Myo 2400T dynamic electromyograph (EMG, Noraxon Inc. Arizona, USA) was employed to
measure muscle activities of the lower limbs. The electrodes were attached to the affected
side over the tibialis anterior muscle at one-third of the distance from the proximal
tibialis anterior muscle, and the muscle belly of the medial gastrocnemius muscle 2&#x02005;cm
proximal from where the Achilles tendon encounters the medial gastrocnemius muscle. The
collected surface EMG signals were digitized using Myoresearch-XP 1.07 software: EMG signals
were sampled at 1000&#x02005;Hz, bandpass-filtered between 20 to 500&#x02005;Hz, and processed with a 60&#x02005;Hz
notch filter.</p><p>A Tetrax Portable Multiple System (Tetrax, Tetrax Ltd, Ramat Gan, Israel) was used to
measure balance ability<xref rid="r15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><sup>)</sup>. When a subject
places a foot on the force plate, the data of the pressure on the force plate is amplified
and filtered before being delivered to a computer. It is then analyzed using the Tetrax
software program. For the measurement of static balance ability, the stability index was
obtained, and the collected data were recorded as percentages of the subjects&#x02019; body
weights.</p><p>The ankle-foot orthosis used in this study was a joint type, and it was appended and raised
by 1/8 of an inch so that the medial malleolus and the lateral malleolus did not meet, and
the arch support maintained or supported the longitudinal arch when it was worn. The medial
and lateral sides of the caput metatarsals tend to widen when they support weight;
therefore, each of the medial sides and the lateral sides were widened by 1/16 inch and the
orthosis was made to be a plantar flexion 90&#x000b0; ankle stop-type using a 5&#x02005;mm thick
thermoplastic material that melted at 170&#x02005;&#x000b0;C. The shoes were made of rubber so as not to
slide. Bands wrapped around the top of the shoes so that they were not easy to remove, and
they were made lightweight so that they could be used indoors.</p><p>Prior to and after the balance training, muscle activities and balance ability were
measured. Four balance exercises were conducted, two on flat ground and two on a balance pad
(balance pad, Airex, Switzerland) for a total of 20 minutes (<xref rid="tbl_002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref><table-wrap id="tbl_002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title> Program for balance training</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Period</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Composition</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Training methods</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Time</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rest</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">0&#x02013;6 weeks</td><td align="left" rowspan="4" colspan="1">On the floor </td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standing on two feet </td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 m</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 s</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standing with both knees flexed</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1 m</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 s</td></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Standing on the affected leg while holding a chair with the

position in bare feet for five seconds. Data were recorded for three seconds from the
tibialis anterior muscle and the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the affected side; the first
and the last one seconds were excluded from the data analysis. Muscle activity signals of
each muscle were converted to root mean square values, and expressed as % maximum voluntary
isometric contraction (%MVIC).</p><p>For the measurement of balance ability, the subjects stood on a hard surface with their
eyes open and with their eyes closed and on a soft pillow with their eyes open and with
their eyes closed. They maintained the standing position without holding a support.
Measurements were made three times in each position, and the average values were used the

stroke patients on muscle activities and static balance of the lower limbs of stroke
patients. After the six weeks of balance training, the data of the two groups were compared
to examine muscle activities and static balance around the ankles related to wearing of the
ankle-foot orthosis. The stability index was significantly different in the NO condition
between the groups, and the AFO group showed statistically significant differences in all
conditions between prior to and after the balance training. The changes in AFO group muscle
activities were significantly greater than those of the shoes group.</p><p>After balance training with the ankle-foot orthosis, there was no significant difference in
the medial gastrocnemius muscle activity of the affected side, but there was a significant
difference in the tibialis anterior muscle activity of the affected side. During balance
training with the ankle-foot orthosis, the muscle activity of the tibialis anterior muscle
of the affected side decreased and the muscle activity of the medial gastrocnemius muscle
increased. However, in the group without the ankle-foot orthosis, there was no pre-post
statistically significant difference in either the muscle activity of the tibialis anterior
muscle or the medial gastrocnemius muscle of the affected side. This result is consistent
with a study in which the ankle muscle activities of nine males and one female in a static
standing posture were examined, and the use of the ankle plantar flexor was predominant<xref rid="r18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><sup>)</sup>. It is also in agreement with a study in
which the anterior-posterior center of pressure of six multiple sclerosis patients and four
ordinary subjects were examined in a standing position and the use of the gastrocnemius was
predominant<xref rid="r19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><sup>)</sup>. However, an ankle-foot
orthosis used postural adjustment by 42 stroke patients whose onset of a stroke was 6 months
prior or earlier, and 61 stroke patients whose onset of a stroke was 12 months ago or
longer, was effective at providing stability for the ankle of early phase stroke patients
but not chronic phase stroke patients, as structural changes has occurred, including changes
in alignment and muscle shortening<xref rid="r20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><sup>)</sup>.</p><p>There was a statistically significant difference in the stability index of NO between the
AFO and shoes group, but there were no statistically significant differences in NC, PO, and
PC between the two groups. In the group who wore the ankle-foot orthosis, there were
significant differences in the stability indexes of NO, NC, PO, and PC, and in the group who
wore only shoes, there were significant differences in NO and PO. This result is similar to
that of study in which postural sway of 28 stroke and traumatic brain injury patients was
measured with and without an ankle-foot orthosis; when the ankle-foot orthosis was worn,
postural sway was small<xref rid="r2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><sup>)</sup>. Our results are
also consistent with those of a study in which balance maintenance of 11 stroke patients and
10 ordinary subjects wearing an ankle-foot orthosis was examined: weight shift to the
lateral side and an increase in weight bearing on the affected side resulted in more use of
an ankle strategy than a hip strategy for stability<xref rid="r4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><sup>)</sup>. In the rehabilitation process of stroke patients, improvement of
balance ability is important. In prescribing orthoses, improvement in balance ability and
gait should be considered. In general, use of an ankle-foot orthosis may be helpful for some
stroke patients&#x02019; balance, but stroke patients differ in degree and area of anatomical
damage. Therefore, changes must be made in accordance with their environment and condition.
Balance training variables appropriate for patients should be selected, and effective
treatment methods should be utilized to maximize patients&#x02019; potential capabilities.
Generalization of this study is limited, as only those patients meeting the selection
criteria were examined. Future research that includes the same kind of patients with
classification of etiology and brain lesions is necessary.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="r1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group><name><surname>Ikai</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Kamikubo</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Takehara</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><etal>et al.</etal></person-group>: <article-title>Dynamic postural control in patients with
