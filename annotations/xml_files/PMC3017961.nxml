With the advances in medicine over the years, the types of ailments being treated have changed. Today, most of the common health problems are traceable to lifestyle. Despite advances in pharmacotherapeutics, the need for lifestyle modification, including physical exercise, healthy habits (abstention from smoking), proper diet, and stress adaptability have become the cornerstone in the management of most of these chronic ailments.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT2">2</xref>] Most systems of complementary and alternative medical modalities (CAM) have become popular because they insist on a healthy lifestyle as a prerequisite to any medication. Thus, the promotion of a positive Quality of Life (QoL) and the movement towards healthier mental, social, and spiritual health has become a necessity which can be improved by community-based, mind-body training programs.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT3">3</xref>] The problems of lifestyle (diet, addictive habits, poor physical activity, and poor stress adaptability) are traceable to poor mastery over the mind. Yoga, as a mindfulness practice, tries to correct the basic limitations of the mind by improving self awareness, self control, and self esteem.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT4">4</xref>] Due to its strong scriptural and experimental knowledge base, yoga has the potential to become an essential baseline modality in all health work, be it for cure or prevention or the promotion of positive QoL.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT5">5</xref>] Yoga offers society a conscious process to solve the problems of unhappiness, restlessness, emotional upsurges, hyperactivity etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT6">6</xref>] Several studies have revealed that yoga has shown markedly higher scores in life satisfaction and lower scores in excitability, aggressiveness, openness, emotional ability, and somatic complaints. Significant differences were also observed with respect to coping with stress and mood.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT7">7</xref>] There are other studies that have independently shown the beneficial effects of yoga on different aspects of health, including physical stamina,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT8">8</xref>] visual perception,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT9">9</xref>] performance,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT10">10</xref>] memory,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT11">11</xref>] intelligence,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT12">12</xref>] and concentration,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT13">13</xref>] using many of the well known standard measures available as research tools. As a holistic science, yoga also provides us with a holistic tool of measurement of the growth of a personality from an instinctual level to higher states of freedom, bliss, and mastery.</p><p>The Gita inventory (GIN)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] is now available as a standardized, psychological tool, and is based on the concept that there are three different levels of human existence in which the mind is always in a dynamic equilibrium between three types of response patterns called <italic>Gunas</italic>. The three patterns are <italic>Sattva</italic> (gentle and controlled), <italic>Rajas</italic> (violent and uncontrolled) and <italic>Tamas</italic> (dull and uncontrolled). In an ideal situation of perfect health, an individual has the complete freedom to use any of these three patterns of responses. Ill health or limited health occurs if <italic>Rajas</italic> or <italic>Tamas</italic> becomes dominant, as one loses freedom and gets habituated to either of these response patterns. Hence, the degree of positive health can be measured by a tool that can grade these three patterns of behaviour.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT15">15</xref>]</p><p>Yoga concepts also include another important measure of an evolving personality, which is the knowledge about one&#x02019;s unlimited potential to move towards perfect harmony with Nature. This is reflected to some extent in modern psychology as self esteem with clear-cut definitions and tools for assessment&#x000b7; Hence, this study includes one of the standard available measures called a self esteem questionnaire (SEQ)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] to see if these concepts correlate with the Gita concepts measured in GIN.</p><p>Whereas yoga is getting popular, the relative roles of yoga and physical exercises have not been studied with regard to their effects on <italic>Gunas</italic> and self esteem. Hence, the present study was designed to find out the effect of the Integrated Approach of Yoga Module on <italic>Gunas</italic> and self esteem in normal healthy adults through a randomized controlled trial.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Two hundred twenty-six subjects who consented to participate in the study, were randomly allocated into two groups of equal size. Inclusion criteria included (a) normal healthy volunteers, (b) both sexes, (c) age between 18&#x02013;71 years, and (d) literates. Exclusion criteria: (a) subjects with any ailment, (b) substance abuse, and (c) smokers.</p><p>Informed consent was obtained from all the subjects who participated in the study and also from the institutional heads where the classes were conducted. The institutional ethical committee of the parent institution had cleared the project proposal.</p><p>This study had a prospective, randomized, single-blind control design to compare the efficacy of yoga (Y) with that of physical exercise (PE) as a control intervention in normal healthy volunteers in a south Indian population. Motivational lectures were arranged in public centers such as colleges, health clubs, Rotary clubs, Lions clubs, and apartment complexes. The classes were planned in five different centers in Bangalore City.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Randomization</title><p>Those who consented to participate in the study and who satisfied the inclusion and exclusion criteria were randomly allotted into two groups by using five different random number tables (different table for each center) generated from the random number generator program.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] After reading the instructions in the informed consent form about the design of the study, these 226 subjects agreed to be in the allotted group. The experimental group was given Y practices and the control group was given PE for one hour daily on an empty stomach (6 to 7 a.m.). The classes were conducted on six days a week for eight weeks and attendance was maintained by the teachers. Trained experts in either Y or PE conducted parallel sessions for the two groups in different rooms of the same building. It was ensured that there was no interaction between the subjects. The tests were self-administered by encouraging subjects to sit in a quiet place free from distractions and influences from other people, before the intervention and eight weeks after the intervention.</p><p>Masking: The answered questionnaires were coded and kept away for future scoring. A psychologist who was not involved in subject allocation or supervision of the classes, scored the questionnaires that were decoded only after the scoring of both pre- and post- data was completed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Assessments</title><p>Assessments were done using the following questionnaires:</p><p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Gita Inventory of Personality (GIN): The GIN inventory is based on the concept of <italic>Gunas</italic> (personality) from the Bhagavadgita, a traditional text of yoga, which was developed by Das in 1991.

In the PE group, no significant changes are seen for any of the transition [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0007">Table 7</xref>].

The upward trend in the central tendency of the scores on the GIN seems to be quite consistent with the Gita concept. This concept proposes that the <italic>Gunas</italic> initially vary in their dominance in determining the personality of an individual (canto 14),[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] but that gradually the individual&#x02019;s personality mostly settles on one of the <italic>Gunas</italic> (canto 14)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT16">16</xref>] and ultimately, though very slowly, through a sort of moral evolution, moves from <italic>Tamas</italic> and <italic>Rajas</italic> to <italic>Sattva</italic>, and finally goes beyond the <italic>Gunas</italic> and attains liberation (cantos 7 and 14).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT17">17</xref>] This trend of shift towards an increase in <italic>Sattva</italic> and a decrease in <italic>Tamas</italic> after eight weeks of integrated yoga practices, but not after PE, is clearly demonstrated in this study.</p><p>Furthermore, in the famous scriptural text, the <italic>Gita</italic> a <italic>guna</italic> indicates a specific behavioral style. <italic>Sattva</italic> indicates purity, wisdom, bliss, serenity, love of knowledge, spiritual excellence, and such other noble and sublime qualities. <italic>Rajas</italic> indicates egoism, activity, restlessness, and hankering after mundane things such as wealth, power, valor, and comforts. <italic>Tamas</italic> implies qualities such as bias, heedlessness, and inertia, besides perversion in taste, thought and action.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT14">14</xref>] <italic>Rajas</italic> and <italic>Tamas</italic> are said to be the manifestations of a violent state of mind in which a person lacks mastery over upsurges of emotions and impulsive behavior. Yoga is known to be useful in promoting positive health at the physical, mental, social, emotional, and spiritual domains, which results in becoming energetic, confident, masterful over the sense organs, possessing harmony and coordination between right and left brain functions, as well as becoming stress-free. These are attributed to the calmness of the mind leading to forbearance and stability of the nervous system,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT24">24</xref>] which are the qualities of a <italic>Sattva</italic> -dominant person.</p><p>A similar study by Dasa[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT25">25</xref>] was conducted by the use of <italic>mahamantra</italic> (chanting of a specific pious chant) and the Vedic Personality Inventory in a three-armed, randomized, prospective, controlled study on 62 volunteers. They showed that the <italic>mahamantra</italic> group had increased <italic>Sattva</italic> and decreased <italic>Tamas</italic> with no significant change in <italic>Rajas</italic> scores, which is also a measure of the three <italic>Gunas</italic>. In their study, they also showed a significant reduction in stress, anxiety, and depression after a month of chanting <italic>mahamantra</italic>, 20 minutes daily for four weeks. The present study has also demonstrated a significant improvement in <italic>Sattva</italic> and <italic>Tamas</italic> scores and a reduction in <italic>Rajas</italic> in females and seniors, which was not found in the earlier study conducted by Dasa.

In the older group, significant changes observed in the Yoga group were for GSE, MSE, SSE, and FSE [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0009">Table 9</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T0009" position="float"><label>Table 9</label><caption><p>Descriptive statistics for self esteem: Age and gender distributions</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Domains</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">Yoga<hr/></th><th align="center" colspan="3" rowspan="1">PE<hr/></th></tr><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean &#x000b1;

The practice of breathing exercises, <italic>pranayama</italic>, and the systematic breathing during <italic>asanas</italic> regularizes the breathing mechanism, trains the proper use of abdominal and chest muscles, and also improves the vital capacity and stamina, which in turn can influence better self esteem.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT27">27</xref>] Yogic breathing exercises positively affect the mood and they have clinical potential as self-control techniques for improving and stabilizing affective states.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT28">28</xref>]</p><p>COM (the ability to evaluate and understand one&#x02019;s personal resources), BPA (body image as a contribution of physical appearance and capabilities) in younger groups and BPA in males were significantly improved in the PE group. Atlantis <italic>et al</italic>. studied the efficacy of exercise-based intervention of eight weeks&#x02019; duration in a population of Australian employees and showed that the intervention significantly improved the QoL in comparison to a waiting list control group (measured by SF-20). They showed an improvement of 12.8% in physical functioning, 9.90% in general health, 44.50% in vitality, and 15.90% in mental health scores.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT22">22</xref>]</p><p>Thus, Yoga helps in the improvement in <italic>Gunas</italic> (personality) and self esteem. These findings reveal that Yoga has greater influence on holistic personality growth (<italic>Gunas</italic>) when compared to routine physical exercise. Hence, it can be considered independently to promote quality of life and health, prevent chronic diseases, and to promote socio-economic development.</p><p>Finally, the fact that there were no significant correlations between the Gita Inventory and the parameters of the Self Esteem questionnaire is noteworthy. This lack of correlation between the two instruments shows that they measure orthogonal qualities.</p><p>Furthermore, we can observe that, like physical exercise, Yoga is traditionally acceptable in India, is easy and cost-effective to perform, and has become popular around the globe. Yet another point of this design is a matched intervention in the form of exercises. However, a third group with no intervention would have given greater insights to the comparisons.</p><p>In summary, this randomized interventional study has shown that the improvement in the Yoga group is more when compared to the physical exercises&#x02019; group for all the <italic>Gunas</italic>, with accompanying promotion of positive health and self esteem. This study thus provides scientific evidence to consider yoga as an independent practice that can be beneficial in improving one&#x02019;s quality of life.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>My grateful acknowledgments for all who helped in this project.
