However, to date, few randomized control studies of MZR are performed in patients with IgA nephropathy. Therefore, this prospective, open-label, randomized, controlled trial aimed to investigate the efficacy and safety of adding MZR to standard treatment in these patients, and was conducted between April 1, 2009, and March 31, 2016, as a multicenter study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to receiving standard treatment plus MZR (MZR group) or standard treatment (control group).

Secondary outcomes were the rate of patients with proteinuria disappearance, clinical remission rate, absolute changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate from baseline, and the change in daily dose of prednisolone. Forty-two patients were randomly assigned to MZR (n = 21) and control groups (n = 21). Nine patients in MZR group and 15 patients in the control group completed the study.

One patient in the control group received MZR after randomization; however, this patient was analyzed as part of the control group in the intention-to-treat analysis. Patients&#x02019; baseline characteristics are summarized in <xref rid="t1-krcp-36-159" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>.

No patient died during this study. Twelve patients in the MZR group and 6 patients in the control group dropped out before the end of this study. The reasons for dropouts were: lost to follow-up (4 patients in MZR group and 2 patients in control group), changed hospital (4 patients in MZR group and 3 patients in control group), diagnosed with malignant lymphoma (1 patient in MZR group), adverse events (2 patients in MZR group), and initiation of renal replacement therapy (1 patient in MZR group and 1 patient in control group).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated the efficacy and safety of MZR administration compared with standard treatment in patients with IgA nephropathy, and found that the hematuria disappearance rate during the late phase of the study was significantly higher in patients in the MZR group who completed the study than in patients in the control group. However, this significant difference in hematuria disappearance rate between the two groups was disappeared by intention-to-treat analysis in this study.</p><p>MZR is an immunosuppressive agent that inhibits purine synthesis by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase expression and suppressing the proliferation of lymphocytes [<xref rid="b7-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. This agent was previously reported to represent renoprotective effects, including inhibition of mesangial proliferation and improvement of urinary protein excretion [<xref rid="b17-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Furthermore, a multicenter randomized control study demonstrated that treatment with angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB) combined with MZR significantly reduced urinary protein excretion, compared with ARB treatment alone in adult patients with IgA nephropathy [<xref rid="b10-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Unfortunately, our study could not show a significant change in the reduction of proteinuria between the MZR and control group. Several reasons would be considered to explain the clinical differences between our results and those from previous reports. First, approximately 80% of all patients in our study underwent aggressive, standard treatment of IgA nephropathy using tonsillectomy and steroid pulse therapy, which have been shown to be as effective as multidrug therapy in pediatric patients with diffuse IgA nephropathy [<xref rid="b18-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In addition, a recent small-scale randomized control trial indicated that the addition of MZR to steroid-pulse therapy did not have an additional effect on urinary protein excretion and renal function in patients with progressive IgA nephropathy [<xref rid="b11-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Furthermore, most patients in our study showed mild histological damage; therefore, a large-scale trial in patients with severe pathological findings may be needed to detect a significant difference in efficacy of MZR administration. Second, approximately 40% of patients enrolled dropped out from this study; therefore, the statistical power of our analysis was possible to be reduced to confirm clinical differences between groups. Third, the clinical efficacy of MZR administration is associated with peak serum concentrations [<xref rid="b19-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Specifically, a peak MZR level of 3 to 5 &#x003bc;g/mL obtained 2 to 3 hours after oral administration is needed to obtain a good response [<xref rid="b20-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In our study, serum MZR concentration 2 hours after administration was 1.80 &#x000b1; 0.87 &#x003bc;g/mL in 12 patients; therefore, MZR dosage may have been insufficient in this study.</p><p>Microscopic hematuria is a potent risk factor for progression to end-stage renal failure in addition to proteinuria [<xref rid="b22-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Disappearance of hematuria was reportedly a powerful predictor of renal prognosis in patients with progressive IgA nephropathy after administration of corticosteroids and immunosuppressant agents [<xref rid="b23-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. However, a recent randomized control trial showed that the addition of immunosuppressants to renin&#x02013;angiotensin system inhibitors improved the disappearance rate of hematuria, but did not attenuate the rate of decline in renal function [<xref rid="b24-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Thus, the relationship between renal prognosis and hematuria disappearance in patients with IgA nephropathy remains controversial. In our study, the hematuria disappearance rate in the MZR group reached &#x0003e; 60% in the late phase of the study, whereas those in the control group were around 40&#x02013;50%. Although the increase in the hematuria disappearance rate with MZR administration may lead to the preservation of renal function in patients with IgA nephropathy, the length of our study was too short to support that conclusion. Therefore, long-term studies are needed to evaluate long-term renal function, including eGFR, in patients.</p><p>Previous report indicated that MZR administration had fewer severe adverse events than other immunosuppressants [<xref rid="b25-krcp-36-159" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Indeed, in this study, there were no serious adverse events among patients in the MZR group. However, mild liver dysfunction developed in one patient, and a low-grade fever in another patient, both of which promptly disappeared after MZR discontinuation.</p><p>This study had several limitations. First, we used an open-label design, which may have introduced interpretive bias. Second, the sample size was small and there were relatively large number of dropouts during the study that could have reduced the statistical power to detect differences in study outcomes. Therefore, long-term studies will be needed to assess the efficacy of MZR for preserving renal function and improving renal prognosis in patients with IgA nephropathy.</p><p>In conclusion, the addition of MZR to standard treatment has no beneficial effect on reducing urinary protein excretion and hematuria when treating patients with IgA nephropathy.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank all patients and clinicians who participated in the study.
