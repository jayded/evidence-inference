Introduction</title><p id="P5">Loneliness is a biopsychosocial stressor that elicits a neuroimmunological stress response that has been consistently associated with multiple cardiovascular morbidities like hypertension [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and coronary artery disease [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] [<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], immunosuppression [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], elevated blood glucose [<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and depression [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The exact mechanism by which loneliness affects physical health is unclear but it is thought to be mediated through immune [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and inflammatory regulation over time [<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] [<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] [<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Recent studies indicate that socially stressed persons are at increased risk for other chronic inflammation-related illnesses like neurodegenerative diseases [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] [<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and some cancers [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] [<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p id="P6">Interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin 6 (IL-6) are two commonly used markers of inflammation, and increased expression of both IL-2 and IL-6 has been shown in cardiovascular disease [<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], COPD [<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] [<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], loneliness [<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]&#x02013;[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and depression [<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] [<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-2 and IL-6, act on the brain by activating the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. HPA axis activation ultimately leads to a secretion of glucocorticoids from the adrenal cortex, mainly cortisol, leading to inhibition of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways [<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] [<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The dynamics between inflammation, HPA-axis activation, and loneliness are quite complex. The majority of studies suggest that loneliness is associated with both increase inflammation and increased cortisol secretion, but given the negative feedback regulation of cortisol on pro-inflammatory signaling, these findings together may seem contradictory [<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. As such, there is still much to be known about the dynamics of inflammation and HPA-axis activity, especially in regards to loneliness.</p><p id="P7">Understanding the role of IL-6 in the inflammatory process is difficult since decreases in Il-6 may actually be a sign of failing to self-regulate an inflammatory process [<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. One gene expression study of 25 participants in the top quartile of the UCLA Loneliness scale scores over a 3 year period, controlled for age, gender, race/ethnicity, marital status, income, and BMI, reports that 98 genes show a &#x02265; 15% difference in average expression in high-lonely individuals when compared to low lonely people. In this study, highly lonely people have a repressive effect on leukocyte activation and it is important to note in this study that the high lonely people have a mean score of 46.5 on the UCLA loneliness scale (scale range 20 &#x02013; 80) [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p id="P8">The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of LISTEN (Loneliness Intervention) on loneliness, depression, physical health, systemic inflammation, and genomic expression in a sample of lonely, chronically ill, older adults. The study had three aims: 1) to describe the relationship between chronic illness burden and loneliness; 2) to describe the changes in loneliness, depression, blood pressure, and BMI over time in chronically ill lonely older adults who have participated in a randomized trial of an intervention for loneliness, and 3) to describe differences in the systemic inflammation and gene expression between participants of LISTEN and attention-control groups.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>2.

Design, Sample, and Setting</title><p id="P10">This was a prospective, longitudinal randomized trial of LISTEN, a novel intervention designed to target specific aspects of loneliness. LISTEN is based on theories of narrative and principles of cognitive restructuring. The development of LISTEN and initial feasibility and acceptability has been previously published in OJN [<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] [<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Twenty-three older, lonely, chronically ill adults were recruited from a primary care center at a university based family medicine clinic in West Virginia between September 2013 and September 2015. To be included, participants had to be aged 65 years or older, living in the community, chronically ill, able to interact in a group intervention setting (minimum mini-mental status score of 23), and moderately lonely (a minimum score of 40 on the revised UCLA Loneliness Scale) [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Participants were randomized to two groups, 13 in LISTEN group (Loneliness Intervention) and 10 in attention control (AC) (healthy aging education). Participants of LISTEN attended sessions that focused on belongingness, relationships, socialization in community, challenges of loneliness, and meaning of loneliness. Participants of the attention control groups received educational lectures on physical changes associated with aging, healthy diet, aging health, prevention of stroke, and routine preventive healthcare. All participants attended 5 sequential weekly 2 hour sessions in the same building at the same times on the same days to ensure fidelity. After completing the 5 weekly sessions, all participants attended a 12 week post data collection meeting (17 weeks post-baseline) for survey completion, physical measures and blood sampling (<xref rid="F1" ref-type="fig">Figure 1</xref>). All sessions were audio and video recorded.</p><p id="P11">Participants attended an enrollment session where they completed consent, survey data (including sociodemographics and chronic illness diagnoses), baseline physical measures, and blood sampling. Sociodemographic information collected included age, gender, marital status, highest level of education completed, household income, and employment status. Physical measurements included height, weight, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and number of chronic illness diagnoses. Psychosocial measures included depression via the 5 item Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and loneliness via the revised UCLA Loneliness scale [<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The development of the 5-item GDS was based on the diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition. Scores on this scale range from 0 &#x02013; 5 and the scale has a reported sensitivity of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.81 [<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The UCLA Loneliness scale scores range from 20 &#x02013; 80, with 80 indicating very high loneliness.</p></sec><sec id="S9"><title>2.3.

Further, there is a positive correlation between scores on the UCLA loneliness scale and Geriatric Depression Scale at baseline(r = 0.507, p = 0.014) (<xref rid="F2" ref-type="fig">Figure 2(b)</xref>), and at 17 weeks (r = 0.453, p = 0.03) (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="S19"><title>3.2. The Effect of LISTEN on Loneliness and Depression</title><p id="P22">While subjects enrolled in the LISTEN group appeared to have a greater decrease in UCLA loneliness scores across 17 weeks compared to subjects in the AC group, this reduction was not statistically significant (AC = &#x02212;4.9 &#x000b1; 6.3, LISTEN = &#x02212;5.4 &#x000b1; 7.15, p = 0.856) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(a)</xref>). There was also a decrease in Geriatric Depression Scale Score in both the AC and the LISTEN group; however, this decrease was not statistically significant within either group (AC-p = 0.229, LISTEN-p = 0.109), nor between groups (p = 0.448) (<xref rid="F3" ref-type="fig">Figure 3(b)</xref>). Interestingly, while the change in UCLA loneliness scores from baseline to 17 weeks did not differ dramatically between groups, the change in UCLA loneliness scores from 6 weeks (end of intervention) to 17 weeks were more significant. Specifically, there was an increase in loneliness in the AC group (mean change = 3 &#x000b1; 7.33), whereas loneliness continued to decrease from 6 to 17 weeks in the LISTEN group (mean change = &#x02212;0.25 &#x000b1; 6.39) (p = 0.067) (<xref rid="F4" ref-type="fig">Figure 4</xref>).

Discussion</title><p id="P25">The findings of this study on older adults who are living in Appalachia are similar to findings reported from national data [<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and prior studies on the relationship between loneliness and chronic illness [<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Our pilot data previously revealed that, in a sample of 60 rural older adults, none were screened for loneliness but 33% were moderately lonely with prevalent multiple chronic conditions. National data analyses indicate that a higher total number of chronic illnesses are predictive of loneliness [<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The finding that loneliness scores are correlated with depressive symptoms is consistent with the health and social science literature which identifies loneliness to be a unique predictor of depression [<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p><p id="P26">Loneliness has been identified as an independent predictor of hypertension [<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] through the physiological stress response. Logically leading to the conclusion that diminishing loneliness may diminish psychosocial stress and lead to diminished blood pressure. This is clinically important because controlling blood pressure decreases the likelihood of poor health outcomes such as stroke, heart disease, and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p id="P27">Findings from this study indicated that both LISTEN and attention control groups decreased in weight and BMI. While not statistically significant, this is a short trial which makes the findings clinically important. It has been reported that lonely adults in varied populations experience obesity [<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>] and metabolic syndrome [<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Poor health consequences of obesity and metabolic syndrome include multiple chronic conditions that are well-documented and very costly to the healthcare system. Thereby, understanding how psychosocial problems like loneliness relate to these conditions is imperative.</p><p id="P28">When considering the findings regarding systemic inflammation and gene expression, the findings are inconclusive. It was interesting that participants who did NOT receive LISTEN had a decrease in IL2 expression which could be interpreted to indicate diminished immunity over time as they continued to be lonely. Diminished immunity has been associated with a chronic lonely state [<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, since both groups did diminish in loneliness over the relatively short study and the LISTEN group also decreased in IL2 expression, the results were not definitive. Though IL6 trended up for both groups, this increase in Il-6 with intervention could be interpreted in multiple ways. Again, since both groups diminished in their loneliness scores, it could be that less lonely persons were better able to moderate inflammation. This would be consistent with recent studies reporting that higher loneliness is related to higher inflammation on measures such as C-reactive protein [<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><sec id="S23" sec-type="discussion|conclusions"><title>4.1. Future Research Implications</title><p id="P29">A better research approach should include a comprehensive assessment of the various arms of the immune system, not just single markers, across genomic and proteomic expression. This approach would require significant blood sampling/processing and a larger sample size than what we have studied here. The power of the techniques used for gene expression in this study lies in multiple sampling analyses and comparing the data over time amongst individuals. Future studies should be designed to optimize the technique as well as the biomarkers to be studied.</p></sec><sec id="S24" sec-type="conclusions"><title>4.2. Conclusion</title><p id="P30">Loneliness is a prevalent problem that contributes to multiple chronic conditions, functional decline [<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>], and mortality [<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] in older adults. Further, loneliness negatively impacts the healthcare system as lonely older adults are more likely to enter a nursing home [<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], more frequently access primary care [<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>], have increased emergency care visits [<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], and report increased use of formal support services [<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]; making loneliness a priority for study in this population. Although our results are not significant, we do observe trends that will inform future studies to further assess the inflammatory/immune patterns associated with loneliness. In the future, enhancing knowledge about the relationships among loneliness, chronic illness, systemic inflammation, and gene expression of these particular targets, and how these relationships may change over time with intervention will inform translation of findings to clinical settings.</p></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><label>*</label><p>Gene expression changes in lonely
