However, exercise regimens can be difficult to maintain over the longer term and pwMS may face unique barriers to physical activity engagement. Pilot research suggests the Nintendo Wii can be used safely at home by pwMS with minimal mobility/balance issues and may confer benefits. We have developed a home-based physiotherapist supported Wii intervention (&#x02018;Mii-vitaliSe&#x02019;) for pwMS that uses commercial software. This is a pilot study to explore the feasibility of conducting a full scale clinical and cost-effectiveness trial of Mii-vitaliSe.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>30 ambulatory, relatively inactive pwMS will be randomised to receive Mii-vitaliSe immediately, or after 6&#x02005;months. Outcomes, measured at baseline and 6 and 12&#x02005;months later, will include balance, gait, mobility, hand dexterity and self-reported physical activity levels, fatigue, self-efficacy, mood and quality of life. Interviews conducted on a purposive sample of participants will explore experiences of participation in the study and barriers and facilitators to using the Wii. Mean recruitment, adherence rate and standard deviations (SDs) of potential primary outcomes for the full trial will be estimated and precision summarised using 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Interview transcripts will be thematically analysed using a generic qualitative approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>National Health Service (NHS; ref 12/SC/0420) and university ethical approvals have been obtained as has NHS Research and Development permission from the relevant trust. A home risk assessment will be undertaken for all potential participants. All adverse events will be closely monitored, documented and reported to the study Safety Monitoring Committee. At least one publication in a peer reviewed journal will be produced and research findings presented at a national and international conference. With service users, we will coproduce a summary of the findings for dissemination on our research unit's website and elsewhere.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ISRCTN 49286846.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Rehabilitation Medicine</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><p>

Psychosocial repercussions include reduced leisure, social contacts, role fulfilment and engagement in activities of daily living; all important for self-esteem and psychological well-being.</p><p>People with long-term disabling conditions such as MS face unique barriers to participation in physical activity<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;28</xref> including physical (eg, pain, fatigue, mobility limitations and overheating), psychological (eg, fear, embarrassment and lack of confidence) and environmental (transport, cost, lack of suitable facilities/trained staff) factors. While home-based activities overcome some of these, adherence to traditional exercise programmes is poor.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Making exercise an enjoyable experience<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30&#x02013;32</xref> undertaken in a non-threatening and comfortable environment along with the provision of detailed guidance, monitoring and support may improve adherence.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>

It is low cost, can be used at home, and has broad appeal, incorporating variables known to enhance motivation, self-efficacy<xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> and adherence (such as self-monitoring, prompts, peer comparison and feedback about progress and performance) in the context of fun<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">49&#x02013;52</xref> purposeful tasks.<xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref> It offers opportunities for socialisation across the lifespan<xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>
<xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> and participation in immersive virtual reality activities that might, in real life, be challenging due to physical limitations, or require further adaptation to enable participation (eg, golf). Games such as Wii Sports use significantly more energy than sedentary activities<xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">56&#x02013;60</xref> (though not as much as playing the sport itself).<xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>
<xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p><p>For the current study the Wii was deemed preferable over other newer more complex virtual reality platforms, such as the Xbox Kinect: it is low cost, requires less space, permits support from a therapist within the field of view and the Wii sensors are relatively &#x02018;forgiving&#x02019; thereby facilitating use by people with impaired or compromised movement.<xref rid="R61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> Our findings will, nevertheless, have applicability to and relevance for other platforms and chronic conditions.</p><p>In conjunction with the Wii balance board, the Wii Fit Plus incorporates games requiring the user to shift his/her weight from side to side and forwards and back to control gameplay. A key feature of these systems is the provision of dynamic visual feedback about centre of gravity allowing training and adjustments of movement via biofeedback techniques. These recent advances in interactive gaming have created the potential for increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentary behaviour.<xref rid="R62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> It has been suggested that such games may be helpful for improving balance and core strength<xref rid="R63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> under the guidance of a qualified health/rehabilitation professional (who can advise on the selection of appropriate activities to challenge balance safely and gradually).</p><p>Wii games can be played for brief periods, at the individual&#x02019;s convenience. Daily activity levels can be accumulated in short bouts of 10&#x02005;min or more throughout the day (which is thought to be as effective as all in one go<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>), at differing levels, and a range of activities can be selected, depending on current symptoms<xref rid="R65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> and preferences. Creating a personalised representation of oneself (a &#x02018;Mii&#x02019;) may enhance self-efficacy via a greater sense of &#x02018;presence&#x02019; and motivation.<xref rid="R66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref></p><p>However, there are potential disadvantages. As with other physical activities, playing the Wii could lead to injury, discomfort<xref rid="R67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>
<xref rid="R68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref> or increased symptoms. Many of the reported injuries have been due to people exercising beyond their limitations and without resting adequately. The user manual<xref rid="R69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref> provides guidance on how to use the Wii safely and onscreen prompts about resting are regularly provided. As the Wii software has been developed with a healthy population in mind, it is important to explore its acceptability to pwMS.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref></p><p>While applications of the Wii are diverse<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71&#x02013;82</xref> and preliminary findings positive, the evidence base is limited and definitive answers require well-designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs). In this pilot study, we wish to explore whether a commercially available interactive gaming system, the Nintendo Wii, offers a safe, feasible way to provide opportunities in the home for increased physical activity for pwMS (which could lead to improvements in domains such as vitality, balance, mobility, QoL and well-being). To date, Wii research with people affected by MS is mostly preliminary. Early findings are promising, however, and suggest that the Wii might be helpful for balance<xref rid="R83" ref-type="bibr">83&#x02013;85</xref> and fitness.<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref></p><p>In a non-randomised pilot study Plow and Finlayson,<xref rid="R86" ref-type="bibr">86</xref> found that pwMS who have mild balance and mobility limitations can use the Wii Fit safely at home. However, they also reported that Wii use declined after 3&#x02005;months. They suggested that a more person-centred approach as well as the use of behavioural change techniques (such as motivational interviewing and problem solving) might help to promote longer term Wii use and foster intrinsic motivation. In a scoping review of the exergaming literature Plow <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R87" ref-type="bibr">87</xref> recommended that trials incorporate longer term follow-up periods, employ mixed methods and follow patients from the clinical setting to the home. Others have suggested that an individualised approach is essential to take into account individuals&#x02019; beliefs, self-efficacy and perceptions about exercise<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> and their self-identity, goals and expectations for improving health.<xref rid="R70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>
<xref rid="R88" ref-type="bibr">88</xref></p><p>Often research projects proceed rapidly to a full scale RCT, with vital, preparatory phases overlooked.<xref rid="R89" ref-type="bibr">89</xref> This can result in a resource intensive and costly analysis of a conceptually or clinically flawed intervention. In this study, we have consulted with pwMS already using the Wii, and adapted existing guidance on using the Wii to develop a home-based physiotherapist supported Wii intervention for pwMS (Mii-vitaliSe).

Mii-vitaliSe addresses limitations highlighted in the literature by incorporating home-based activity, behavioural change principles, employing mixed methods and including a long term follow-up period. Findings from this study will establish whether a full scale RCT is feasible and, if supportive of proceeding to a full trial, will inform its design and conduct. The decision on whether to progress to a full trial will be made by the trial steering group. No specific criteria have been set. If found to be effective in a full trial, Mii-vitaliSe could increase activity levels in a group of people known to have low activity levels overall and could be readily implemented in a healthcare system such as the NHS. Technological developments in this field are ongoing with rehabilitation software currently being developed for the Nintendo Wii and other platforms. The general principles and findings from this research will have relevance for the next generation of software and platforms and also for other chronic conditions.<xref rid="R71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>
