Survival in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is relatively low, generally between five per cent and 10%. Being able to explore new methods to improve the relatively low survival rate is vital for people with these conditions. Passive leg raise (PLR) during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has been found to improve cardiac preload and blood flow during chest compressions. <bold>The aim of our study</bold> is to evaluate whether early PLR during CPR also has an impact on one-month survival in sudden and unexpected out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA).</p></sec><sec><title>Method/Design</title><p>A prospective, randomized, controlled trial in which all patients (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) receiving out-of hospital CPR are randomized by envelope to be treated with either PLR or in the flat position.

Secondary end-point: survival to hospital admission to one month and to one year with acceptable cerebral performance classification (CPC) 1&#x02013;2.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>PLR is a simple and fast maneuver. We believe that the greatest benefit with PLR is when performed early in the process, during the first minutes of CPR and before the first defibrillation.

Attwood et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] estimated the incidence of and survival from EMS-treated OHCA in Europe and found, for &#x0201c;all-rhythm&#x0201d; CA, an incidence of 37.72 per 100,000 person-years. Survival was 10.7% in &#x0201c;all-rhythm&#x0201d; CA. If these results were applied to the European population, approximately 275,000 persons would experience an all-rhythm, EMS-treated OHCA, with 29,000 persons surviving to hospital discharge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>].</p><p>To resuscitate a person, without neurological damage, various efforts, which are described as the four links in the chain of survival (early call, early CPR, early defibrillation and early advanced life support), have to be optimal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During the last decade, the quality and continuity of chest compressions have been increasingly highlighted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. The reason is that blood flow and coronary perfusion during cardiac arrest are related to the quality and continuity of chest compressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. A coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) above 15&#x000a0;mmHg, at defibrillation, also appears to be necessary for the return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Consequently, different methods and devices to improve blood flow to the heart (coronary perfusion) and brain during CPR, such as different types of mechanical compressor and impedance threshold device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], have been studied.</p><p>The initial CPR guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] stated that the &#x0201c;elevation of the lower extremities may promote venous return and augment artificial circulation during external cardiac compression&#x0201d;. However, in the 1992 guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], this statement was removed. The reason for this decision was a lack of clinical evidence. During the last five years, the debate on how PLR may improve the outcomes of the resuscitation maneuvers in CPR has been re-opened.</p><p>According to Pr&#x000e9;au et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], the effect of PLR is equivalent to a rapid intravenous volume expander by shifting blood from the lower extremities towards the intra-thoracic compartment. A 45&#x000b0; leg elevation for four minutes increases right and left ventricular preload and, by definition, the stroke volume, if the heart is preload dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. This makes PLR predictive of fluid responsiveness among patients with circulatory failure, e.g. sepsis and acute pancreatitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], and it has been recommended as part of haemodynamic monitoring in recent international recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Other researchers have also shown the benefit of using PLR to increase resistance to blood flow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], thereby shifting fluid from the lower extremities to the central circulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>The present study design is based on a pilot study recently conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden. This pilot study concluded that a 20&#x000b0; leg elevation during CPR improved the levels of end-tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) during CPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It has previously been concluded that EtCO<sub>2</sub> correlates well with blood flow and that PLR induces an increase in descending aortic blood flow of at least 10% or in echocardiographic sub-aortic flow of at least 12% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. In other studies, EtCO<sub>2</sub> has been shown to be quantitatively predictive of stroke volumes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. EtCO<sub>2</sub> has also been described as an important value for predicting ROSC and CPR quality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The resuscitation in the Gothenburg pilot study was performed using both manual and mechanical compressions made by LUCAS TM 2 (Lund University Cardiac Assist System), but the effect of PLR appeared to be greater during manual compressions. It was only possible to speculate on the reason for this, but the EtCO<sub>2</sub> value started from a higher level in the mechanical group. The possible reason for this could be the &#x0201c;active decompression&#x0201d; creating a larger preload.</p><p>Dragoumanos et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] found in their animal study that the coronary perfusion pressure (CPP) also increased when PLR was performed during CPR and auto-transfusion of the aorta by PLR was the explanation. It is unclear whether this mechanism can be transferred to humans. The literature also includes some case reports and letters advocating PLR during CPR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. However, no studies showing that PLR during CPR will increase survival have been conducted.</p><sec><title>Hypothesis</title><p>The early elevation of the lower extremities during out-of-hospital cardiopulmonary resuscitation increases survival to one month by improving cardiac preload and blood flow to the heart and brain during chest compression.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Design/method</title><sec><title>Population/area</title><p>Tarragona is a province in eastern Spain, in the southern part of the autonomous area known as Catalonia. The district of Tarragona has 814,000 inhabitants in an area of 6,303&#x000a0;km<sup>2</sup>. The population density is 128.2 inhabitants/km<sup>2</sup> and 17.4% of the inhabitants live in the City of Tarragona and the surrounding areas. The rest are scattered throughout the province, which is composed of 183 municipalities distributed in ten areas. Coastal populations multiply their usual population by five during the months of July and August. The average age of the population is 40&#x000a0;years and 50.49% are men. There is a great deal of scatter in terms of the population throughout the area because of the large rural area that exists there.</p></sec><sec><title>Organisation</title><p>Depending on the season, the Emergency Medical Service (EMS) system in Tarragona has around 70 units divided into eight advanced life support (ALS) units, including one helicopter, and 61 basic life support (BLS) units. The ALS units are staffed by one nurse, one physician and one technician and the BLS units by two technicians. Normally, the BLS units are the first responders in health emergencies, e.g. cardiac arrest. The Region of Tarragona has eight public hospitals, located around the region, with different levels of specialities and the highest levels are located in the City of Tarragona.</p></sec><sec><title>Method and design</title><p>A prospective, randomized, controlled trial in which all patients (&#x02265;18&#x000a0;years) receiving out-of hospital CPR are randomized by envelope to be treated with either PLR or in a flat position. The ambulance crew use a special folding stool, which allows the legs to be elevated about 20 degrees.</p><p>The PLR manoeuvre needs to be performed immediately (within five minutes) after the arrival of the first ambulance. Leg elevation has to be maintained while the patient receives chest compressions during CPR and has to be stopped when the patient has an ROSC or when a medical decision is made to interrupt these maneuvers. PLR is to be performed at an angle of between 20 and 45 degrees (approximately 35 to 40&#x000a0;cm). An instruction video is produced for training prior to the study; the aim of using a specially designed folding stool is to standardise the intervention as much as possible.</p><p>In the start-up phase between June 2013 and April 2014, the study has only been conducted in the City of Tarragona and the surrounding areas. In all, 13 mobile units (12 BLS and one ALS unit) will attend (attended) in the start-up phase. Since April 2014, a further 56 units, the whole province, have been participating in the study. The study will continue for three years.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Patient selection and randomization</title><sec><title>Inclusion/exclusion</title><sec><title>Inclusion</title><p>All patients of both sexes who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiorespiratory arrest and require CPR and who are attended by the BLS and/or ALS units in the Tarragona area.</p></sec><sec><title>Exclusion</title><p>Patients aged&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;18 will be excluded from the study.</p><p>Allocation concealment is ensured via opaque, numbered and sealed envelopes.

Subsequently, survival to one month and one year in the cohort of OHCA also varies. As a result, the sample size will be estimated from a survival level of seven per cent.

However, when we applied for new approval in 2011, the study was rejected due to the lack of informed consent. At the moment, there is a debate in Sweden about the opportunity to perform studies of different treatments on unconscious patients. One important issue in the debate is that clinicians find it difficult, time consuming and unethical to ask next of kin, who are upset, for their informed consent in acute situations.</p><p>Before we started the present intervention in Spain, we performed our power analysis according to an estimated survival of 7%. In their reports from Spain, Rosell Ortiz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] and Alvarez Fernandez [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] stated a survival rate of around 10% and an incidence of 25/100,000 EMS-treated OHCAs. Bystander CPR was reported to be performed in about 15% of all cases. Compared with Sweden, the survival rate was similar (10%), but the incidence of EMS-treated OHCA was twice as high (50/100,000) in Sweden [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. The reason for this can only be speculated on, but shorter ambulance delay in combination with a higher proportion of bystander CPR in Sweden (68%) might be an explanation. Another possible explanation could be the higher competence level in the Spanish ALS units. Compared with the Swedish nurse-staffed ambulances, the Spanish physician-staffed ALS units might have the opportunity to cease resuscitation more frequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].</p><p>The Swedish pilot study revealed increased EtCO<sub>2</sub> during PLR, which we interpret as improved cardiac preload and blood flow to the heart and brain during chest compressions. The benefit was greatest when the rescuer performed manual chest compressions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The previous study of PLR was made at an angle of 20 degrees, but, in the present study, we decided to allow the angle to range from 20 to 45 degrees to make the clinical application more flexible. However, the chief researcher (CR) in Tarragona has equipped all the units with a folding stool made of plastic to enable the legs to be elevated 22 centimetres (about 20 degrees).</p><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>The power calculation is based on an estimated survival rate of 7%. If the survival rate is lower, we will need a larger sample than calculated. With regard to the outcome of the treatment during OHCA, it may be that the chance of survival does not increase. In no case, however, is there any risk to the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>The project will be led by the Department of Nursing at the URV in Tarragona and will include researchers from the Department of Statistics and Mathematics and the Department of Basic Medical Sciences, as well as clinical practitioners with extensive experience of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) research and practice and experts in the field from the University of Bor&#x000e5;s, Sweden.
