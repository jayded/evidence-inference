Introduction</title><p>Numerous studies have investigated combined nutritional supplementation with exercise or training programs for enhancing an athlete&#x02019;s performance. Creatine (Cr) is one of the most popular and widely researched natural supplements designed to increase exercise-related strength and power [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Studies have demonstrated some positive effects of short-term (5&#x02013;7 days) Cr supplementation on exercise [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. A number of review articles have also reported that Cr supplementation can significantly increase strength, power, and/or work performance during multiple sets of maximal effort muscle contractions [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Complex training generally involves a heavy resistance-training exercise followed by a biomechanically similar plyometric exercise [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Recently, complex training has been suggested to be an effective training method for enhancing power output in athletes [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The physiological rationale behind complex training has been termed postactivation potentiation (PAP) [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. PAP refers to the phenomenon by which the acute contractile ability of a muscle is enhanced in response to a conditioning stimulus such as a heavy resistance exercise (HRE). Therefore, the effects of PAP have been used in pre-exercise warm-up, complex training programs because of its positive acute effect on increasing motor performance and its chronic effect on enhancing strength and power [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, studies have reported different and contradictory results. Some studies have indicated that explosive performance is enhanced within 3&#x02013;5 min after HRE [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], whereas other studies have not shown a positive effect when explosive performance was performed immediately after the HRE [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. These conflicting results may be because PAP is influenced by muscle fatigue and is an individualized phenomenon.</p><p>Both fatigue and PAP appear to be at their maximum and coexist immediately after the HRE stimulus [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Fatigue is more dominant in the early stage of recovery and masks the effects of PAP. Consequently, subsequent exercise performance is diminished or unchanged [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, a shorter recovery time (&#x0003c;15 s) causes a decline in the jump performance after HRE [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Two principal mechanisms for the development of fatigue during intensive muscle contraction are the rephosphorylation of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and an increase in the concentration of hydrogen ions (H<sup>+</sup>) resulting from the dissociation of lactic acid, which lead to a decrease in phosphocreatine (PC) [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In this scenario, one could speculate that optimizing energy provision would be an essential factor in mitigating the negative effects of fatigue on PAP. Cr plays an important role in skeletal muscle energy metabolism. Cr supplementation could aid the rephosphorylation of ADP to adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and improve cellular homeostasis during bouts of intense activity by utilizing the H<sup>+</sup> produced during the process of creatine kinase reaction to buffer the pH [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A previous meta-analysis reported that Cr supplementation had a pronounced effect on short-duration (&#x0003c;30 s) high intensity exercises [<xref rid="B25-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. In this regard, Cr supplementation may have positive effects on reducing muscle fatigue after HRE. Additionally, Cr supplementation may facilitate the reuptake of calcium ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum via calcium pumps [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This may generate force more rapidly during short-duration, predominantly anaerobic, intermittent exercises due to faster detachment of the actomyosin bridges [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>It seems that optimal performance occurs when fatigue has subsided, while the potentiated effect still exists [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, the precise recovery time is essential. Recent studies have focused on optimal PAP recovery time for warm-ups between HRE and explosive performance and have attempted to identify the precise recovery time needed to elicit a PAP effect during warm-up periods [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. However, there is no consistent agreement on the required recovery time. Studies have suggested that recovery durations of 5 min [<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], 8 min [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], 4&#x02013;12 min [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], 7&#x02013;10 min [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and 8&#x02013;16 min [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] may elicit PAP, leading the authors to conclude that PAP is a highly individualized phenomenon [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B19-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B28-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Individual backgrounds (training experience, level of performance, and predominance of fast twitch fibers <italic>etc.</italic>) can also affect the PAP response. Therefore, the application of individual recovery times (optimal individual PAP times) is an effective approach. Nonetheless, very limited studies have investigated the issue of optimal recovery time between HRE and explosive performance.</p><p>To our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of Cr supplementation on increasing PAP effects during a complex training bout. This study aimed to examine the effects of short-term Cr supplementation on strength and power performance as well as the optimal individual PAP time during a complex training bout. We hypothesized that Cr supplementation would increase maximal muscle strength and power performance, as well as shorten optimal individual PAP time during a complex training bout.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-nutrients-08-00143"><title>2. Experimental Section</title><sec id="sec2dot1-nutrients-08-00143"><title>2.1. Research Design</title><p>Before formal measurements, all subjects visited the laboratory initially to ensure familiarity with the back squat and the countermovement jump (CMJ) technique. Subjects were educated on the familiarization session by a well-trained fitness instructor. They conducted 2&#x02013;10 times of CMJ until correct technique can be performed. Thereafter, subjects completed 2&#x02013;5 sets of 6&#x02013;10 repetitions using only a men&#x02019;s Olympic bar (20 kg) to familiarize with the squat movement technique, 1 min interval for recovery was used in each set.</p><p>The day after familiarization session, the anthropometry and the strength of one repetition maximum (1RM) back squat were measured. Two days later, subjects also performed two sets of complex training bouts to determine the individual optimal timing of PAP, height and peak power (PP) of CMJ in another two days. A double-blind, randomized matched-pair design was used to assign 30 subjects from three explosive type sports to control for two potential variables (different training routines of teams and 1RM strength) into a Cr or placebo (Pla) group. After six days of high dose Cr or Pla supplementation, the same test procedures before supplementation were conducted again to evaluate the effects of Cr supplementation. Meanwhile, a low dose of Cr or Pla supplementation was maintained until the end of the study. All familiarization and experimental sessions of this study were performed at the same time (from 10:00 to 14:00) of each day.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-nutrients-08-00143"><title>2.2.

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Taoyuan General Hospital, Taiwan. All subjects provided written informed consent before participation. They maintained their basic training programs and were asked to keep their normal diet pattern during the experimental period. Subjects were excluded if they had one of the following: (1) a maximal squat strength less than 1.5 times their body weight [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; (2) injury to a lower limb within the past six months; (3) the experience of both back squat and plyometric training within less than 1 year; or (4) have taken chronic or daily doses of anti-inflammatory medications or nutritional supplements within the past month.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-nutrients-08-00143"><title>2.3.

Subjects in the Pla group (Pla. gr.) followed the same protocol but consumed carboxymethyl cellulose (food grade CMC powder, GreenYoung Co., Taichung, Taiwan) instead of Cr. The supplements for both groups were the same color and taste.

In brief, subjects jogged for 5 min on a treadmill followed by lower/upper limb light stretching exercises and two light resistance warm-up sets.

Discussion</title><p>This is the first study investigating the effects of short-term Cr supplementation on sport performances during a set of complex training bouts. Overall, the major findings of this study are that Cr supplementation significantly increased the maximal strength of the lower limbs and reduced the negative influence of fatigue on PAP during a set of complex training bouts. However, this acute benefit could not enhance explosive performance.</p><p>Our results show that the optimal individual PAP time was significantly earlier after Cr supplementation. Studies of Izquierdo <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] and Urbanski <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] reported that five days of Cr supplementation (20 g/day) significantly improved the total repetitions performed to fatigue during repetitive high-power-output exercise bouts and increased the time to fatigue during three bouts of submaximal knee extension. Rahimi <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] also found that seven days of Cr supplementation (20 g/day) increased the number of repetitions and the training volume on the 5th of a 6-set of squat exercises. The authors concluded that the mechanisms for these improvements may be due to an increase in the availability of PC to synthesize ATP during contraction, PC resynthesis during recovery and muscle buffering capacity. Taken together, these physiologic changes reduce fatigue and increase the recovery rate from exercise. The outcome of this study was consistent with previous studies [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B35-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p><p>However, our study did not show any significant improvement in explosive performance after Cr supplementation. This result may be explained by certain observations that have been reported in several studies [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Hamada <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B10-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] indicated that PAP was induced in the knee extensor muscles by a 10-s maximum voluntary isometric contraction (MVC) and immediately after the MVC. The PAP of twitch peak torque increased with a mean of 70.6% immediately but then rapidly declined to +44% and +31% at 30 s and 60 s, respectively. Potentiation continued to decrease only 12% above the pre-MVC value after 5 min. Similar findings have been reported in another study [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] in which twitch potentiation in the knee extensor muscles after a 7-s MVC was immediately increased and then sharply declined during the first and third minutes of recovery. These findings demonstrated that peak PAP was immediately increased by conditioning contraction, but instantly began to decrease with a rapid decline for 3 min followed by a more gradual decline over the remainder of the recovery period. Therefore, although optimal individual PAP time in our study was earlier from 6.13 min to 4 min, the elicited PAP was not sufficient to enhance the performance of CMJ. Additionally, we found that the 1RM strength back squat increased after Cr supplementation. This result is in agreement with previous studies [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="B37-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and reviews [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These studies have examined the acute effects of Cr loading (20 g/day for 5&#x02013;7 days) on strength performance and generally concluded that the mechanisms underlying this improvement were due to an enhanced capacity of high-energy phosphate diffusion between the mitochondria and myosin heads, thus enabling the heads to engage in cross-bridge cycling and tension maintenance. Other reasons may involve a substantial increase in the rate of ATP synthesis and the amount of power generated during the short duration (in seconds) of a very power-demanding exercise such as 1RM.</p><p>Our finding supports the hypothesis that PAP is a highly individualized phenomenon. We found that some subjects had the greatest PAP effect 3&#x02013;6 min after HRE, whereas this time interval varied for other subjects. Our results are in agreement with a previous study by McCann <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] who found that a majority of subjects had their largest PAP in a vertical jump height with 4 min of rest, while a quarter of them (25%) responded better to a 5 min rest interval. Our finding is also in line with Naclerio <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] in which the optimal individual potentiation of PAP was displayed over a broad window of potentiation from 1 to 12 min after different volumes of conditioning activity. Comyns <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-08-00143" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] also reported that subjects had their greatest improvement in flight time and ground reaction force performance at four different rest intervals (30 s, 2, 4 and 6 min). As other studies have suggested, the discrepancy in optimal individual recovery time can be attributed to the differences in the subjects' backgrounds.</p></sec><sec id="sec5-nutrients-08-00143"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study provided potentially important information about the effects of short-term Cr supplementation on enhancing maximal muscle strength of the lower limbs and improving the influence of fatigue on the PAP effect during a set of complex training bouts. Moreover, an appropriate individual rest interval may be paramount to optimizing the effectiveness of complex training.</p><p>Further studies should evaluate the efficiency of Cr supplementation on other main biomarkers and athletic performances after long-term complex training with optimal individual PAP time and should attempt to combine other nutritional supplements for added beneficial effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Financial support provided by the Ministry of Sciences and Technology (MOST) of the Executive Yuan, Taiwan under grant No. NSC 102-2410-H-179-002 is gratefully acknowledged.
