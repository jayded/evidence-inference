The ongoing decline of cognitive function leads to a high risk of disability which is a significant burden for patients and caregivers around the world. The incidence of AD increases in people over 65&#x000a0;years of age, with a prevalence of 4.8% in this age group and representing approximately 60&#x02013;80% of dementias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, the health costs associated with AD, the reduced quality of life, and the increased risk of mortality severely affects the social development and quality of family life of AD patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Although some of the current treatments offer some symptomatic relief, this disease cannot be cured at present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Cholinesterase-inhibitors (CIs) donepezil, rivastigmine, and galantamine are recommended for clinical use according to the guideline of The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE, now National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The glutamate receptor antagonist memantine has also been approved and recommended by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat moderate to severe AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. CIs have modest symptomatic but not curative effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] and these classes of drugs have considerable adverse reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Some studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] have shown that acupuncture may be effective for improving the cognitive function of AD patients; however, because of the lack of rigorous randomization and adequate sample size, there is still not enough evidence to show the effectiveness of acupuncture. This trial aims to determine the effectiveness of electroacupuncture (EA) as an adjuvant therapy for donepezil in improving the cognitive function of patients with AD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/Design</title><p id="Par23">This trial is a prospective, randomized controlled, clinical trial to be conducted between June 2017 and December 2019. Three hundred and thirty-four participants with AD will be recruited at Guang&#x02019;anmen Hospital, Beijing, China via the hospital web or posters. Recruiting and screening will be in the charge of a research assistant, whereas the diagnosis will be made by a neurologist. A 2-week baseline assessment will be conducted. Randomization is performed by the pharmacological assessment center at Guang&#x02019;anmen Hospital. The participants identified as eligible will be randomized into two groups&#x02014;EA combined with donepezil and donepezil&#x02014;at a ratio of 1:1. The random block is set to 4, and random grouping is produced by using the Statistics Analysis System (SAS) software. Random numbers and information about grouping are sealed into opaque envelopes with correlative sequence numbers of entering the trial marked on the outside. Acupuncturists will open the envelopes according to the sequence numbers. The flowchart of the trial is shown in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>.

The change from baseline in total MMSE score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], in the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease Cooperative Study-Activity of Daily Living (ADCS-ADL) score, and in the Quality of Life-Alzheimer&#x02019;s Disease (QOL-AD) score measured at weeks 12 and 36. The MMSE score is commonly used for estimating the severity of cognitive impairment with a maximum score of 30. The questions in this scale included orientation to time, orientation to place, attention and calculation, recall of three words, and visual construction. The ADCS-ADL score contains 19 domains about assessment of basic and operational ability of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].

According to previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], 39% of patients showed an improvement of at least 4 points on the ADAS-cog score after being treated with donepezil. We estimated the rate to be 39% in the donepezil group and 55% in the EA combined with donepezil group. Three hundred and four participants were needed to provide 80% power at a significant level of 5% using analysis of variance. The total sample size required for the study is 334 (167 each group) assuming a 10% loss to follow-up.</p><p id="Par35">Baseline score of the ADAS-cog and age will be used as a covariate when assessing the differences between the EA combined with donepezil group and the donepezil group by an analysis of covariance for the primary and the secondary variables if data fits the normal distribution.

All the data will be blindly analyzed by the statisticians from the Clinical Evaluation Center of Guang&#x02019;anmen Hospital. SPSS 20.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) statistical software will be used for the statistical analyses.

The results of this study will contribute to a better understanding that whether EA has additional effects to donepezil for improving the cognitive function of patients with AD.</p><p id="Par41">Although clinical diagnosis is the core criteria for AD patients, preclinical diagnostic criteria, such as bio-marker evidence for AD, are also used in clinical practice and research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) as the typical imaging appearance can differentiate AD from ageing with a sensitivity and specificity of 80&#x02013;85%. The severity of MTA combined with clinical information seems justified to be taken into account when diagnosing AD in clinical practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Therefore, the included criteria of this trial are based on the degree of atrophy of hippocampal or medial temporal lobe volume (measured by MRI). Moreover, as the MTA-scale scores differentiate between moderate to severe AD patients with a sensitivity of 70&#x02013;100% and a specificity of 67&#x02013;96%, according to the severity of the condition of participants, subgroup analysis will be applied in the statistical analysis. Furthermore, donepezil is approved by the FDA to treat the symptoms of mild to moderate AD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] and studies have shown that it can improve the neuropsychiatric, cognitive, and global functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Accordingly, donepezil was chosen as a positive control in this trial. Additionally, an appraisal of drug evolution for AD has shown that the primary outcomes of trials can be described within cognitive, functional, global change, and severity domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. On the basis of this appraisal, the primary outcome is the ADAS-cog score. The ADAS-cog, assessing the severity of impairment of selective areas of cognition, is a sensitive and reliable neuropsychological test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Moreover, a previous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] which had a similar design also evaluated the change in ADAS-cog score after treatment, but follow-up effectiveness was not assessed. Therefore, a 12-week treatment with a follow-up at 24&#x000a0;weeks is expected to better demonstrate the additional effect of EA to donepezil in treating AD.</p><p id="Par42">However, a limitation of this trial is that participant blinding is not possible due to the two different therapeutic strategies employed for each group. Therefore, to minimize any bias that may result from the two treatments, the process of randomization will be under strict control and the investigators and data analysts are to be blinded. Acupuncture as a complex intervention produced greater response expectancies and placebo effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, the expectancy effects of acupuncture cannot be estimated in this trial due to the impaired cognitive function of AD patients.</p><sec id="Sec12"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par43">We are currently recruiting participants for this trial.</p></sec></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec13"><title>Additional file</title><p id="Par51">
