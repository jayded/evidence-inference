Ayurved advocates lekhankarma and Arimedadi pratisaran. Charaka, Bhavprakasha and Yogratnakar Arimedaditaila as mukhrognashaka. The present study aimed to study the effect of lekhankarma karma and Arimedadi Tailam on dantasharkara.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Method:</title><p>30 patients having dantasharkara were selected and scaling done with ultrasonic maschine in control group. In trial group, scaling was done in thirty patients followed by Arimedadi Tailam pratisarana for two times a day for one month.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Result:</title><p>After scaling the Dantasharkara in both groups was persistent on third day but after 90 days only 4 patients had the problem in trial group and 25 patients in control group. Dantaveshtashoth, putiasyata and puyaraktasrava were relieved but in the next follow up, recurrence was observed in control group whereas in trial group there was no recurrence.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Recurrence of Dantasharkara is delayed. Dantaveshtashotha, putiasyata and puyaraktastrava got reduced immediately and there was no recurrence. Arimedadi Tailam does not produce dantaharsha symptom after scaling. Arimedadi Tailam has number of drugs, which acts as raktastambhak, shothahar, kaphavatashamak and mukhadurgandhinashak on account of which it reduces above symptoms and also prevents dantaharsha and dantakshaya.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
