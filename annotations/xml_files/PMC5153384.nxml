However, low plasma levels could reflect adaptive and beneficial stress responses rather than conditional deficiency. The conditional deficiency hypothesis of glutamine has been challenged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], and it has been suggested that interfering with a potential adaption could be deleterious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>This could suggest that supplementation with immune-modulating nutrients in critically ill patients does not improve outcome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and for safety reasons any patient with multi-organ failure in the ICU should not receive immune-modulating nutrients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Studying mortality in critical illness and plasma status of immune-modulating nutrients after supplementation may provide pathophysiological insight and potentially facilitate redefinition of practice guidelines recommendations.</p><p>In the MetaPlus study, immune-modulating high-protein (IMHP) enteral feeding enriched with glutamine, fish oil and antioxidants was compared with standard high-protein (HP) enteral feeding in critically ill patients, and a hazard ratio (HR) of 1.57 (95% CI, 1.03&#x02013;2.39; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.04) was shown for 6-month mortality adjusted for age and APACHE-II score comparing IMHP with HP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].

Patients assigned to IMHP received a glutamine, omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidant (selenium, vitamin c, vitamin e and zinc)-enriched experimental tube feed. Those assigned to HP received an isocaloric/isonitrogenous high-protein tube feed (Nutrison Advanced Protison, NV Nutricia, Zoetermeer, The Netherlands). Patients were fed according to routine practice with recommendations toward early enteral feeding up to target energy requirements of 25&#x000a0;kcal/kg body weight with a maximum of 2500&#x000a0;kcal/day. Patients received study formulations during ICU stay for a maximum of 28&#x000a0;days.</p><p>The primary endpoint was incidence of new infections. Among others, 28&#x000a0;days and 6-month mortality were secondary parameters.

For mediator analyses, it is important not only that a given treatment (IMHP vs. HP) is associated with the outcome (6-month mortality), but also that the treatment induces changes in mediator plasma concentrations (association path A) and that these changes are associated with the outcome (association path B). In case a potential mediator is inserted into multivariate analysis (Model II), the effect of the treatment (C&#x02032;) should disappear. In other words, the treatment induces statistical significant changes in the outcome (6-month mortality increase) through an increase in plasma levels, these increases in plasma levels are associated with the increased 6-month mortality, and this effect is mediated through the treatment and not due to other factors</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13613_2016_220_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

In Model II, changes in plasma concentrations are suggested to mediate the relationship between treatment (IMHP vs. HP) and outcome (6-month mortality) when both the A and B association paths are statistically significant present and the C&#x02032; path association coefficient is closer to zero than in the C path in model I.</p><p>In Model II, the A path depicts the relation between the intervention (IMHP vs. HP) and changes in plasma nutrient status.

This mechanism might have played a role as glutamine serves as precursor for de novo arginine production through the citrulline&#x02013;arginine pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Consequences for the glutamine debate</title><p>Our results show positive associations between higher baseline plasma glutamine and increased 6-month mortality in all patients and in non-medical patients. These findings contradict the hypothesis that glutamine is a conditional essential amino acid during critical illness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>This hypothesis is mainly based on one study from 2001 showing that ICU patients with plasma glutamine levels below 420&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L show increased hospital mortality compared with patients with higher levels (420&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L)&#x000a0;[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, mean age in the low glutamine group (74&#x000a0;years) was statistically significant different compared to the high glutamine group (63&#x000a0;years). Age was not included in the hospital mortality logistic regression analysis as separate explanatory factor. Including age potentially could have changed the strength and direction of associations, as in the MetaPlus study we showed that age is a strong independent mortality predictor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and our present analysis demonstrates that including age group covariates markedly influences associations between baseline levels and 6-month mortality. Recently, it was shown that not only low ICU admission plasma glutamine levels (&#x0003c;420&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L), but also high plasma glutamine levels (&#x0003e;930&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L) were associated with increased 6-month mortality, suggesting a U-shaped relation between plasma glutamine and 6-month mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Furthermore, in septic patients, non-survivors had statistically significant higher median plasma glutamine levels (648&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L) compared to survivors (460&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In the MetaPlus study, only 2 patients had plasma levels &#x0003e;930&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L and 95% confidence intervals of baseline plasma glutamine levels were 339&#x02013;391&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L (IMHP group) and 334&#x02013;378&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L (HP group)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], suggesting the univariate positive association between baseline glutamine concentration and 6-month mortality is not influenced markedly by very high baseline concentrations.</p><p>The REDOXs trial showed increased mortality with glutamine supplementation and raised questions whether critical illness is associated with low plasma glutamine levels at all [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] and whether interfering with glutamine supplementation could be deleterious [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>Our post hoc analysis does not show associations between changes in plasma glutamine and 6-month mortality. Moreover, changes in plasma glutamine concentrations were not found to be a mediator of harmful treatment effects of IMHP versus HP in medical patients. Therefore, our post hoc analyses do not support the hypothesis that interfering with glutamine supplementation in medical critically ill patients is deleterious. However, this should be interpreted with caution and it may not be concluded that glutamine is not harmful as the enteral dose of glutamine supplementation and the effect of IMHP on glutamine levels were very modest. Furthermore, plasma glutamine levels, independent of the treatment allocation, were very comparable in both groups as seen in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Consequences for the epa and dha debate</title><p>This post hoc analysis is the first to suggest that a change from baseline to day 4 in (epa&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;dha)/lcf plasma level ratios has a positive association with 6-month mortality risk. Average plasma (epa&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;dha)/lcf ratios among healthy persons across 16 European regions vary from 3.4 to 8.9%, due to differences in food intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our study, average ICU admission values were below this range (2.5%), while after supplementation with IMHP for 4 or 8&#x000a0;days, averages were within these ranges. Among HP supplemented patients receiving no epa or dha, averages remained low, or even slightly decreased, suggesting a fast response of plasma status on epa and dha supplementation in IMHP patients. In the OMEGA study among acute lung injury ICU patients, Rice showed fast increases in plasma status within 3&#x000a0;days in epa, dha and gamma-linolenic-supplemented patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Rice concluded that fish oil supplementation might be harmful as illustrated by higher risk of 60-day mortality. Critics of the OMEGA trial suggested that twice daily bolus administration and higher protein intake in control patients confounded results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, our present results suggest that increased 6-month mortality in the IMHP group versus the HP group with similar amounts of protein was mediated through increases in (epa&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;dha)/lcf ratios from baseline to day 4 during continuous feeding. Therefore, without the perceived limitations of the OMEGA trial, we now report similar hazardous effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation among medical critically ill patients. Consequently, our findings do not support suggested clinical benefits of omega-3 fatty acids in enteral nutrition to preserve immune function and prevent aspects of the inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], as we did not observe any benefits on infectious morbidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. As we did not measure biomarkers of immune function or inflammation, we cannot rule out that immune stimulation or anti-inflammatory effects have occurred. However, in the OMEGA trial no reductions in levels of inflammatory biomarkers despite marked increases in plasma omega-3 fatty acids were observed. The mechanism why increases in plasma omega-3 fatty acids are associated with increased mortality in medical critically ill patients remains unclear. We speculate that due to the suggested anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil IMHP not only reduced the systemic inflammatory response but also enhanced the compensatory anti-inflammatory response syndrome (CARS). It has become apparent that CARS is not simply a consecutive response to SIRS and hyperinflammation, but that both responses may occur simultaneously in the early phase after ICU admission. Possibly, we have induced the so-called persistent inflammatory immunosuppressed catabolic syndrome (PICS) in these patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Another speculation is based on interesting data on omega-3 fatty acids supplementation during exercise in healthy volunteers showing reduced maximal power output by 10% and maximal heart rate by 6% within 1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days of supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. These negative cardiovascular and metabolic effects of omega-3 fatty acids supplementation during exercise probably are mediated by other mechanisms than omega-3 fatty acids incorporation into plasma membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Consequences for the antioxidant debate</title><p>Recent guidelines on nutritional support for critically ill patients by the Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition indicate very low evidence for routine supplementation of antioxidants summarizing studies until 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In these guidelines, it is indicated that antioxidant and trace element supplementation is associated with significant reductions in overall mortality. Recent REDOXs and Signet trials did not show any benefit or harm from antioxidant supplementation, but a recent retrospective study on selenium supplementation in postoperative ICU patients with sepsis showed increased mortality in univariate analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Our post hoc analyses show positive associations with baseline zinc concentrations and 6-month mortality in medical patients. However, there was no effect of IMHP versus HP treatment on plasma zinc levels and no association between increase in plasma zinc concentrations and 6-month mortality, with similar results for selenium, vitamin e and vitamin c. Therefore, we hypothesize that harmful effects of IMHP versus HP treatment is not due to these antioxidants.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the Metaplus study provides the largest database to study effects of nutritional treatment on plasma concentrations of immune-modulating nutrients in a heterogeneous mechanically ventilated ICU population. Although our data suggest mediator effects of changes in plasma (epa&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;dha)/lcf ratio, we must consider that findings are based on results from unplanned post hoc analyses. Furthermore, the relationship could be associative without direct causality if an underlying unknown confounding factor is involved. The intervention was a cocktail of various immune-modulating nutrients and may confer positive or negative effects on mortality, with or without interaction. Furthermore, post hoc analyses only generate hypotheses and therefore preclude firm recommendations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We hypothesize that the harmful effect of immune-modulating high-protein enteral nutrition compared to high-protein enteral nutrition in the MetaPlus trial studying a heterogeneous group of critically ill patients is limited to the medical critically ill patients and mediated by an early increase in (eicosapentaenoicacid&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;decosahexaenoicacid)/long-chain fatty acid plasma ratio, resulting in increased 6-month mortality.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec11"><title>Additional file</title><p>
