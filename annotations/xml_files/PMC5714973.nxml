This study aimed to investigate the effect of multimedia self-care program on quality of life in burn patients.</p></sec><sec><title>METHODS</title><p>This Randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from November 2015 to December 2016. The samples were hospitalized burn patients with 10% to 45% of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> degree burns of total body surface area (TBSA). The patients were randomly allocated into experimental (n=50) and control (n=50) groups. Both groups received the routine in-person self-care trainings of the hospital and then the experimental group received self-care compact disks. The quality of life questionnaire in both groups were completed before intervention and after 3-months and statistically analyzed.</p></sec><sec><title>RESULTS</title><p>Accordingly, the changes in quality of life and the dimensions between both groups after 3 month of intervention were significant.

Quality of life in adult is based on happiness and satisfaction which influence on the well-being of people with physical, mental, social and role functioning and communicational performance.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>
</p><p>One of the major goals of health care systems is to maximize the performance and to improve the quality of life in the daily life. In this processes, the patients&#x02019; self-care strategies improve the self-management and reduces the pain and other disorders. However, the patient will acquire enough knowledge and skill to make decisions and solve the self-related problems.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Nurses, as an important health care member having a crucial role in caring and increasing self-care health knowledge, rehabilitation and improving quality of life of patients. Through possible intervention, nurses have the ability to direct their patients&#x02019; life to balance and affect their quality of life.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Patient&#x02019;s self-care education helps to increase health care programs and to decrease relapse rates and frequent clinic attending. Lack of self-care knowledge is one of the most important reasons for patient&#x02019;s rehospitalization.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> In multimedia self-care programs, contents are offered through, at least, two elements such as text, voice, image, video or animations. Moreover, they are accessible any time.<sup><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Multimedia self-care programs, as a methodology can facilitate patient&#x02019;s self-care learning.<sup><xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Since there have been few studies regarding self-care education and quality of life of burn patients, and with regard to significance of patients&#x02019; rehabilitation to self-care for their quality of life, researchers tried to conduct this study on the effect of multimedia self-care education on the quality of life in burn patients. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A randomized clinical trial study was conducted on 100 eligible hospitalized burn patients from both genders who were selected using easy sampling method. The patients were allocated randomly into two groups of experimental and control. The samples were10% to 45% burn of total body surface area (TBSA) with degrees of 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup>, or sets of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> who were accessible. With regard to the previous studies on quality of life and effect of self-care education, the number of samples were 50 in each group, with confidence interval of 95%, test power of 80%, and the minimum acceptable differences of 10 in quality of life for both groups with10% drop-out rate, totally including 100 sample size. </p><p>Before the intervention, the informed consent form was signed by all participants of the study, the demographic questionnaire was completed for both experimental and control groups. Then, they received self-care routine recommendations face to face. The experimental group received a multimedia self-care CD (The contents were designed for burn patients, CD-based educational books and educational resources).<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The contents were also approved by educational experts in Motahari Burn Injury Hospital in Tehran. The self-care included movement and activities, daily works and social relations, care of repaired burn areas and areas of grafted skin, nutrition, compression clothing or garment recommendation for mental health care, sleep improvement, and pharmacological care. Moreover, they also received an in-person briefing session for possible questions for the Cd at patients discharge.</p><p>Questionnaire of patient&#x02019;s quality of life (Brief burn specific health scale) once before intervention at patients&#x02019; discharge and 3 months after intervention were completed by the subjects of both groups. To complete the questionnaire, it is worth mentioning that the forms were completed via phone call. The questionnaire of quality of life of burn patients (the Burn specific health scale: BSH-B) was designed and used in 2001<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> and in Iran in 2010, 2013 and 2014.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup><sup>-</sup><sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> In this study, the BSH-B content validity was reviewed and corrected by 10 university faculty members of medical universities. The reliability was measured through completion of the questionnaire by 20 burn patients admitted in Motahari Hospital and repeating it after 15 days determined by test-retest, Cronbach alpha coefficient of 0.89.</p><p>The questionnaire included 40 questions (18 questions were related to physical, 11 to mental and 11 about social &#x00026; quality of life aspects) about how to care the burn site, the job, communication, the ability to do simple activities, and also their textual performance. They also had options of high, low, medium, extremely and never which were scored from 1 to 5, respectively. Therefore, each question had a minimum score of one and maximum point of 5. </p><p>To analyze the data, descriptive and deductive statistics was used. To study distributive homogeneity of demographic features in both experimental and control groups, chi-squared and Exact Fisher&#x02019;s tests were applied. To assess the normality of distribution of data, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used. To compare the quality of life among both groups, nonparametric sign test of Mann Whitney was applied. To compare the mean scores of quality of life before and after 3 months of intervention in both groups, Mann Whitney test was used. Statistical analysis was undertaken by SPSS software (Version 20, Chicago, IL, USA). The ethical approval of this study was also granted from Research Ethical Committee of Iran Medical Sciences University</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In this study, there were totally 100 patients including males and females. In experimental group, 34.90% of the subjects were between 39-48 years old, and in control group; 44.90% of them were between 29-38 years. The main cause of burn injuries was flame (35%), the deepest burn (62%) among both groups were 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> degree of burns. The TBSA among most individuals was between 21% and 26% in both groups. Regarding occupation and marital status, there was a significant statistical difference between groups; but the result of one-way ANOVA analysis showed no significant statistical differences for quality of life between groups, so these two variables were not intervening variables (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). </p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Relative and Absolute frequency distribution of demographic features of both groups of experimental and control</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" colspan="2" rowspan="2">
