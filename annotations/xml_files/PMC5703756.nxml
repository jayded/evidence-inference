Most of these patients only require symptomatic treatment and referral to a neurologist or the patient&#x02019;s family physician on an outpatient basis (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Migraine, tension, and cluster are three types of primary headaches with considerable clinical overlap, which suggests the same pathophysiology (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>).</p><p>Common drugs used to treat these headaches are intravenous (IV) and oral opioids, ergot alkaloids, antiemetic, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS) (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). </p><p>Intranasal route of drug administration may be more effective than other routes, with lower chance of emesis, and a quicker onset of action (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Intranasal delivery of zolmitriptan, civamide, cocaine, and sumatriptan has been tried for treatment of migraine and cluster headaches (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Lawrence Robbins showed the safety of intranasal lidocaine as a an adjunctive&#x000a0;medication in cluster headache control (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). Studies have reported that nasal lidocaine decreased cluster and migraine headaches within several seconds to 2 minutes (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). However, Blanda and their colleagues didn&#x02019;t find any evidence that supports the mentioned issue (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>There has been limited experiences regarding primary headache management through intranasal medication in ED. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal lidocaine in primary headache management in ED.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>
<bold><italic>Study design and setting</italic></bold>
</p><p>This randomized, double blind placebo controlled trial was done on patients presenting to emergency department of Golestan Hospital, Ahwaz, Iran, from July 2012, to December 2014 with primary headache (migraine, cluster or tension). The study design was approved by ethics committee of Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences under the number U-91159 and registered on Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials under this number: IRCT201212289148N2. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. Researchers adhered to declaration of Helsinki protocol and confidentiality of patients&#x02019; information.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Participants</italic></bold>
</p><p>The subjects were patients between 15 &#x02013; 55 years old who presented to the emergency department with complaints of primary headaches (migraine, cluster, or tension) according to the definition of International Headache Society and Ad Hoc Committee&#x000a0;on&#x000a0;Classification of Headache. Patients with signs of secondary headaches such as fever, meningismus, trauma, unstable vital signs, and altered mental status were excluded. Lactating and pregnant women as well as who had taken analgesic medications 2 hours before referring to ED were also excluded. Participants were randomly assigned to either treatment or control group using simple random sampling method.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Intervention</italic></bold>
</p><p>Patients in the treatment group received 1 mL intranasal lidocaine 2% (20 mg lidocaine) and 7.5 mg intravenous (IV) chlorpromazine and those in control group received 1 mL intranasal normal saline 0.9% and 7.5 mg IV chlorpromazine. The lidocaine and normal saline were sprayed with the same shape and color containers.</p><p>
<bold><italic>Data gathering</italic></bold>
</p><p>A checklist that consisted of baseline characteristics (sex, age), type of primary headache, pain severity, and possible complications was filled for all patients by a senior emergency medicine resident under supervision of an emergency medicine physician. Visual analog scale (VAS) was used to rate the pain severity at the baseline as well as 5, 15, and 30 minutes after drug administration. In addition, patients were observed for an additional 30 minutes to assess whether they responded to the treatment or whether their pain returned. </p><p>Patients, in charge physicians, and data analyzer were blinded to drugs given to each group. </p><p>
<bold><italic>Outcome</italic></bold>
</p><p>5, 15, and 30 minute success rates were considered as the main outcome of the study. </p><p>
<bold><italic>Statistical analysis</italic></bold>
</p><p>Considering 95% confidence interval (CI), 80% power, and according to the Maizals et al. and Blanda et al. findings (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the minimum sample size for each study group was calculated to be 50 cases. Data analysis (intention to treat analysis) was performed by the statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) version 21. Findings were presented as mean &#x000b1; standard deviation or frequency and percentage. Student t test, ANOVA and chi square or Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests were used for comparisons. Success was defined as an at least 3 points decrease of pain severity (based on VAS) 5, 15, or 30 minutes after treatment. P &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as significant. </p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>
<bold><italic>Baseline characteristics</italic></bold>

</p><p>In the current study, we administered intranasal 2% lidocaine for different types of headache and not just for migraine. We followed patients in both the treatment and control groups for only a short time. We did not perform follow-up assessments. In addition, because our treatment group received lidocaine and chlorpromazine together, our study is limited in its assessment of pure lidocaine&#x02019;s ability in pain management.</p></sec><sec
