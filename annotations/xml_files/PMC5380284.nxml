Patients undergoing abdominal surgery experience reduced gastrointestinal peristalsis owing to extensive dissection, postoperative exhaust, and long duration of anesthesia. Postoperative ileus (POI) is referred to as delayed defecation, lasting for 3 to 5 days, prolonging the resumption of regular bowel movements following abdominal surgery. Extended hospital stays increase the risk of hospital-acquired infections, deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary compromise, and total hospital costs.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> Traditional interventions to prevent POI or restore bowel function after surgery include decompression of the stomach with a nasogastric tube, adequate pain control,<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup> early mobilization of the patient to stimulate bowel function, epidural anesthesia,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> and drugs such as metoclopramide, erythromycin, neostigmine, alvimopan, among others.</p><p>Recent studies aimed at shortening the period of POI have revealed that chewing gum can stimulate gastrointestinal motility, thereby reducing POI.<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup> However, contradictory findings in other studies<sup>[<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> refute the effects of gum-chewing on peristaltic movements and digestive system stimulation. In addition, most previous studies were after colorectal or gynecology surgery, whereas few reports focused on the effect of gum-chewing after gastrectomy<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to assess the effectiveness of gum-chewing on restoring postoperative bowel function in patients who received laparoscopic gastrectomy.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients and study design</title><p>This study was a prospective, single-center, randomized, and controlled clinical trial. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effectiveness of gum-chewing on postoperative bowel function and included consecutive adult patients with gastric cancer receiving elective laparoscopic surgery in Shanghai Tongji hospital from March 2014 to March 2016. The study was reviewed and approved by the Shanghai Tongji Hospital Review Board and the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Tongji Hospital. It was registered with the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (Protocol ChiCTR-TRC-14004287).</p><p>For identification of cases, patient inclusion criteria were as follows: age &#x02265;18 years; satisfactory consciousness (i.e., alertness) and cooperativeness toward chewing; underwent laparoscopic radical gastrectomy (including conversion to open surgery); any gender; any BMI; and informed consent.</p><p>Exclusion criteria for the study participation included the following: age &#x0003c;18 years; unconsciousness after surgery; no teeth or defective or incomplete chewing movement; need of long-term fasting and having received total parenteral nutrition; pyloric obstruction; remnant of gastric cancer; recurrence of gastric cancer; palliative surgery for advanced gastric cancer; refusal to participate in the trial; muscular and neurological disorders; history of drug addiction, especially opioids; and severe water and electrolyte disturbances.</p><p>The participants were given a thorough description of the research approach before entering the study. After eligibility had been established and patients provided written informed consent, patients were randomly allocated by a 1:1 ratio to the gum-chewing (Gum) or control (No gum) groups using a computer-generated (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.random.org/">www.random.org</ext-link>) randomization sequence in our coordinating office. The sequence was then provided to the participating nurses by telephone after the operation. The same surgical group, to ensure technical replication, performed all the operations. All patients remained enrolled until the end of the study.</p></sec><sec><label>2.2</label><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>The required sample size in each group was calculated using G&#x02217;Power software (University of Kiel, Germany). The time to first bowel movement was used for power analysis because it was more accurate than the time to flatus. For this purpose, the medical records of patients who had undergone laparoscopic gastrectomy between January 2012 and January 2013 were reviewed. The mean time to first bowel movement was estimated to be 122&#x0200a;&#x000b1;&#x0200a;40 hours. The few previous studies on the effect of gum-chewing after gastric surgery showed conflicted results.<sup>[<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we assumed a 20% reduction of time to bowel movement for the gum-chewing group, according to a previous meta-analysis,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> whose results were mostly from colectomy studies predicting a 98-hour mean time to bowel movement for the gum-chewing group, with a clinically relevant difference of 40 hours. A minimum sample size of 36 patients per randomization arm was estimated to obtain a power of 80% for detecting a difference at the 5% level.</p></sec></sec><sec><label>3</label><title>Interventions and data collection</title><p>The protocol was carried out as follows: patients in the Gum group chewed sugarless gum for at least 15 minutes at 7:00, 12:00, and 18:00 from the first postoperative day (POD)-1 and continued until the day of exhaust defecation (up to 7 days). The patients in the No gum group received medical interventions with standardized ward care, thus minimizing confounding variables, to permit comparison for a placebo-like control for gum-chewing (i.e., sham feeding) alone. Although the patients, ward nurses, and the research assistant could not be blinded, all other investigators were blinded. Patients or their relatives completed their own confidential questionnaires to prevent bias and subjectivity.</p><p>Specific elements of the traditional enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) were incorporated, including preoperative and intraoperative warming. Other ERAS elements included use of patient-controlled analgesia, early removal of urinary catheters for most cases, and early ambulation, beginning on POD 1.</p><p>We followed the strategy for removing the nasogastric tube within 24&#x0200a;hours after surgery.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> Patients were subsequently allowed to receive a clear-liquid diet. The drain was removed when the aspirate was minimal or nonpurulent, usually within 3 to 4 days. Using 24-hour durations as time points after operation, we recorded the occurrence of first flatus and defecation, the incidence of POI, pain scores, nausea, and vomiting scores (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), analgesic drug use, and complication data. Adynamic or paralytic ileus that persisted for &#x0003e;3 days following surgery was termed POI.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> Complications were graded and reported using the Clavien&#x02013;Dindo (CD) classification.<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> Complications of grades I and II were defined as minor complications, and grades III and higher were defined as major complications. The data-collecting instruments included the interview form, questionnaires, and the examination of subjects. In addition, age, sex, comorbidity, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, duration of the operation, need for postoperative analgesics, morbidity, mortality and postoperative hospital stay were also recorded. At our hospital, discharge from the department was performed when 3 conditions were fulfilled: normal body temperature for at least 24 hours, normal leukocyte count, and no apparent surgical site infection.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>VRS pain scale and WHO Nausea and vomiting grade.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="medi-96-e6501-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec><label>4</label><title>End points</title><p>The primary end points were time to flatus, time to defecation, and the incidence of POI.

POI can result in pain, vomiting, and abdominal distension; this can delay the speed of a patient's recovery after major gastrointestinal surgery. In recent years, reducing the burden of surgery, postoperative complications, and facilitating rehabilitation have been the focus of patient management. Gum-chewing is one of the treatments for POI, but there is no consensus on its efficacy for lessening the time to flatus and defecation.</p><p>A meta-analysis published in the Cochrane database in 2015 provided some support for a benefit of postoperative gum-chewing in improving recovery of gastrointestinal function.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> This documentation reviewed 4053 records, of which only 81 met the inclusion criteria, including 10 studies of gastrointestinal surgery, whereas the rest regarded cesarean or other surgeries. Of those 10 studies, 6<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> found no significant difference in time to flatus and defecation after gastrointestinal operation between gum-chewing and control groups. However, 4 studies<sup>[<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> found that gum-chewing could hasten the recovery of flatus and defecation. Nine of these 10 randomized control trials studied surgery for colorectal disease (except Bonventre research,<sup>[<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> which included gastric, colon and cholecystectomy.) There were only 4 documentations about laparoscopic surgery<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> and the rest were about open colonectomy. More recent meta-analysis suggested that gum-chewing in the immediate postoperative period after a cesarean section is a well tolerated intervention that enhances early recovery of bowel function.<sup>[<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</sup> However, as to the effect of gum-chewing after colorectal resection, the results remained inconsistent based on the latest studies<sup>[<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Our research was a prospective randomized control study of POI management after laparoscopic gastrectomy that included 75 gastric cancer patients. As mentioned above, little research has focused on the effect of gum-chewing on return of gastrointestinal function after laparoscopic surgery, especially for gastric cancer. Our results were essentially the same as most previous studies,<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> suggesting that gum-chewing may not enhance gastrointestinal recovery after laparoscopic surgery for gastric cancer in the ERAS program.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> A promising intervention to enhance gastrointestinal recovery is early postoperative feeding, hypothesized to activate the cephalic-vagal reflex.<sup>[<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</sup> Cephalic phase hormonal release occurs through the activation of vagal-efferent fibers in response to food-related sensory stimuli. Gum-chewing stimulates the person to eat and increases peristaltic bowel movements, hastening ileus recovery owing to the cephalic-vagal reflex. Therefore, there are 3 reasons that might explain why gum-chewing could not enhance gastrointestinal recovery in the present study. First, the vagus nerve trunks were divided during gastrectomy, especially in total gastrectomy, which may block the cephalic-vagal response and make gum-chewing ineffective theoretically. Second, the effect in promoting the bowel movements by sham feeding was likely offset by the early feeding routine set forth in the ERAS program. In consideration of the fact that most patients in our study were submitted to laparoscopic treatment, another possible reason is that the weak improvement owing to gum-chewing is not significant enough to observe after laparoscopy.</p><p>It was slightly surprising to find that patients had significantly higher pain scores in the Gum group on POD 2. According to patient feedback, gum-chewing may exhaust them after operations, lowering their pain threshold, whereas Fitzgerald<sup>[<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]</sup> proposed that some ingredients of gum may aggravate the feeling of pain. Although more pain was seen in the Gum group, there were no significant differences in analgesic drug consumption that would indicate the pain was considerably less endurable in the Gum group compared to the No gum group.</p><p>There are several limitations to our trial. First, our study was limited by the fact that all of the patients were treated at a single hospital. Second, this was a single-blind randomized controlled trial, and the fact that the patients were not blinded to their group assignments could lead to selection bias. Third, although we documented the time to flatus and defecation as the primary endpoint of our study, these measurements were not very accurate, partially because of patients&#x02019; frequent omission of their first flatus; thus, these indicators were too subjective. In future studies, we would improve these limitations by using multichannel luminal manometry or electrical recordings.<sup>[<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]</sup> Fourth, we only applied part of the ERAS program to the management of our patients as standard care. ERAS is a multimodal perioperative care pathway designed to attenuate the stress response during a patient's journey through a surgical procedure, facilitating the maintenance of preoperative bodily compositions and organ function, to better permit achievement of early recovery.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> This process was initially thought to be a radical move away from tradition and dogma to a fundamental change in the (more effective) perioperative management of patients, and this process has struggled to gain wider acceptance.<sup>[<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]</sup> Moreover, the contents of ERAS have also changed with time. Although our trial protocol was partly consonant with ERAS, we also followed traditional surgical practice for gastric tube decompression, with routine placement of drainage tubes and urinary catheters. Therefore, more complete ERAS adoption should be applied to future studies.</p><p>In summary, our study suggests that gum-chewing after laparoscopic gastrectomy may not hasten the return of gastrointestinal function and may in fact increase pain on the second postoperative day. Therefore, gum-chewing may not be recommended in patients receiving laparoscopic gastrectomy. As to the clinical application of gum-chewing after open gastrectomy, it should be based on the results of further prospective, randomized, and controlled trials.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors are grateful to Zhenqing Tang (Master of Public Health) for his help with statistics.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: ASA = American Society of Anesthesiologists, CD = Clavien&#x02013;Dindo classification, ERAS = enhanced recovery after surgery, PCA = patient-controlled analgesia, POD = postoperative day, POI = postoperative ileus.</p></fn><fn fn-type="equal"><p>BG, HZ, and RL contributed equally to this work</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>This project was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Number81370586), Health and Family planning Commission of Shanghai (Grant No. 201540072), Shanghai Science and Technology Committee (Grant No. 15411962600), and the Fundamental Research Funds for Central Universities (Grant No. 1508219072).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>[1]</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>MD</given-names></name><name><surname>Walsh</surname><given-names>RM</given-names></name></person-group>
