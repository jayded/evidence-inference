Therefore, preventing diabetes at an earlier stage is very important. Despite advances in antidiabetic agents, we have not yet achieved any satisfying results in treating diabetes. Among various treatments, medicinal herbs and supplements for diabetes are reported to show generally good efficacy and safety data. In particular, PURIAM110, a compound from orange fruits and mulberry leaves, is supposed to prevent the progress of type II diabetes mellitus and improve diabetic symptoms. This is the first reported pilot study about the protective effect of the orange fruits and mulberry leaves mixture against pre-diabetes on Korean adults. Based on these positive results of herb-derived components, extended studies of dietary supplements have to be done to suggest confirmative evidences.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The efficacy and safety study of PURIAM110 is a double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized, and multi-center clinical trial. A total of 45 subjects will participate in this study for 6 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The present protocol will confirm the efficacy and safety of PURIAM110 for pre-diabetes, suggesting more basic knowledge to conduct further randomized controlled trials (RCT). In addition, PURIAM110 can be an alternative dietary supplemental remedy for diabetes patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ISRCTN: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN44779824">ISRCTN44779824</ext-link></p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Pre-diabetes is a condition of potential diabetes mellitus with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In other words, it is a state of either impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT). Pre-diabetes is asymptomatic in many occasions, but once it develops into type 2 diabetes, it makes patients suffer from polydipsia, polyuria, polyphasia, unusual weight loss, and extreme fatigue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Unmanaged chronic diabetes mellitus affects quality of life and induces life-threatening diabetes-associated complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Its mortality rate cannot be ignored in Korea, becoming the fourth leading cause of death by 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. According to the Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey (KNHNS) 2001, prevalence rates of diabetes were 1.4 million (8.1%) in Korean men and 1.3 million (7.5%) in Korean women. Nowadays, it is reported that about 308 million people worldwide are having impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and among them 25% to 75% will develop diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Since the exact figures of Korean pre-diabetes patients and diabetes progressing rates were not reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], we can deduce from the above numerical statement that a considerable population <italic>must be </italic>at the status of potential diabetes. Socioeconomic expenditures are also high, at 193 million won per year for medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Therefore, preventing and treating efforts for the non-insulin taking patients in the stage of pre-diabetes and diabetes are urgently needed to lift the burden from both the nation and patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Even though novel remedies have been produced unceasingly, most of them seem to be often ineffective for this disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Meanwhile, dietary supplements are known to be relatively effective in treating diabetes, with few adverse effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Among 400 reported herbal medicines for diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], recent studies suggests that bitter oranges and mulberry leaves have antidiabetic effects. PURIAM110, a compound made from orange fruits and mulberry leaves (patent application no. 10-2006-0020040), is expected to prevent the progress to the early stage of diabetes mellitus, safely [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Bitter orange is a dried, immature fruit of <italic>Citrus aurantium L</italic>., used from ancient times to remove the stagnation and distension in hypochondriac regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Like other herbal components, its mechanism of action seems to be complex though, the fruit has been identified to produce antihyperglycemic activity. Mulberry leaf is a dried leaf of <italic>Morus indica L</italic>., which also shows hypoglycemic properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. It has been prescribed widely to dispel wind-heat and heat in the lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Relying on pathophysiologic mechanisms from traditional Korean medicine, diabetes can be caused when there is heat in the lung or a deficiency of energy (Yang qi) and body fluid. Therefore, bitter orange's qi driving activity and mulberry leaf's heat dispelling function in the lung can be applied to play an antidiabetic role.</p><p>Despite the advantages of herb-derived supplements, few RCTs have been conducted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], and the bitter oranges and mulberry leaves compound is not an exception. Further trials of dietary supplements have to be done to suggest confirmative evidence.</p><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the PURIAM110, a dietary supplement for the treatment of patients with pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus non-insulin dependent stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. This paper is the first pilot study with orange fruits and mulberry leaves on Korean adults who are at the status of pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus not in the insulin requiring stage. The results of this study will give us the clinical of biochemical parameters, such HbA1c, fructosamine, fasting glucose and 2-h OGTT glucose between the placebo and PURIAM110 groups. On the basis of the results, we can suggest the optimal design, precise sample size, and primary outcome for a further large scale RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Objectives &#x00026; Hypothesis</title><sec><title>Objectives</title><p>The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the efficacy and safety of PURIAM110 on non-insulin taking Korean adults in the stage of pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus.</p><p>The secondary objective is to estimate the precise sample size and primary endpoint required for the large scale RCT.</p></sec><sec><title>Hypothesis</title><p>We hypothesize that glucose concentration of pre-diabetes and diabetes mellitus who are treated with PURIAM110 will be lower than that of the control group.

So we adopted a pilot study design.</p><p>Two points had to be considered in deciding the sample size. One was the special condition of herb-derived dietary supplements regulatory law in Korea, and another was limited research fund. Since herbs have historical efficacy and safety profile in Korea, KFDA regulates dietary supplements under a different rule, compared to conventional drugs. In other words, as the efficacy and safety of herbal products have been clinically validated for a long time, the regulatory authorities have lightened restrictions, such as minimizing sample size. We have planned the dietary supplement study according to this KFDA rule. The KFDA rule prescribes that when designing a dietary supplements trial, the sample size has to be a minimum 30 per group. Therefore we first fixed the number of the subjects in the treatment group as 30.</p><p>As the research funding was restricted, we plan to allocate 15 individuals for the placebo group. When sample size is inevitably restricted, it is considered to be more ethical by the KFDA to set more subjects in the test group than in the control group. In conclusion, a total of 45 subjects will be recruited in this pilot study.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The study subjects will be randomly assigned to either PURIAM110 or placebo group at a ratio of 2:1, according to the 'random number table' generated by SAS software package (SAS institute, Inc, Carey, NC, USA, version 8.2).</p></sec><sec><title>Blinding</title><p>The study drugs are double blinded to both investigator and subject.

We will use this questionnaire to classify Korean pre-diabetes and diabetes (not insulin requiring stage) patients. Also we will apply this questionnaire to evaluate the association between the pre-diabetes susceptibility and the patient's constitution.

The continuous variables will be summarized as mean&#x000b1;SD (standard deviation) and the categorical variables will be described in frequency and percent. For the primary and secondary outcome variables, the mean differences between before (visit 2; baseline) and after the treatment (visit 4) values will be compared using the paired t-test or Wilcoxon test, in each group. The baseline characteristics will be compared by either the Student t-test for the continuous variables or &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>-test for the categorical data (alternatively, Fisher's exact test will be used if the expected value is less than 5 or McNemar's test for non-normal distribution data). The efficacy of PURIAM110 will be assessed by using the independent t-test (when normality assumption is satisfied, alternatively Mann-Whitney test will be used). All analyses will be based on a two-sided test at a 5% significance level. With values of p &#x0003c; 0.05 will be considered statistically significant. SPSS for windows version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, Illinois) will be used for analyses.

This pilot study will be the groundwork for the larger scale RCT. To draw confirmative conclusion about the therapeutic efficacy and safety of pre-diabetes supplements, a full-scale RCT has to be done. To proceed with the trial, two criteria must be decided through this study. First, the adequate sample size has to be calculated. As there were no published studies with similar outcomes, we had difficulties in obtaining the mean and variation estimates for the study. Therefore, we designed a pilot trial to figure out the mean and standard deviation. Besides, this study result will also provide a magnitude of the clinically significant treatment effect. With these estimates, we will be able to compute the exact sample size of the larger multicenter study. Second, the primary endpoint has to be fixed. The current preclinical study results suggest that bioflavonoids, hesperidin, and naringin, which are contained in mulberry leaves and bitter oranges, prevent not only hyperglycemia but hyperlipidemia in type-2 diabetic animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Based on these consequences, we decided to include lipid profile (total cholesterol, triglyceride, LDL cholesterol) indexes, in addition to the glucose related parameters (HbA1c, fructosamine, fasting glucose, 2-h OGTT glucose, fasting insulin). Among the glucose and the lipid related parameters, we will decide the primary outcome for a large scale trial according to the result of this study. Furthermore, as anti-diabetic agents show ethnic differences, PURIAM110 has to be verified by more various groups.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations used</title><p>KNHNS: Korean National Health and Nutrition Survey; IFG: impaired fasting glucose; IGT: impaired glucose tolerance; KFDA: Korea Food &#x00026; Drug Administration; RCT: Randomized controlled trial; LDL: low density lipoprotein; OGTT: oral glucose tolerance test; WC: waist circumference; HC: hip circumference; VAS: visual analogue scale; SOP: standard operating procedure; QSCC II: Questionnaire for the Sasang Constitution Classification II; ITT: intention-to-treat; PP: per protocol; SD: standard deviation; LOCF: Last Observation Carried Forward; CRF: case report form; AE: adverse event; CRA: clinical research associates; CRO: contract research organization; IRB: Institutional Review Board; GCP: Good Clinical Practice</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>SKG substantially contributed to the general idea and design of the study.
