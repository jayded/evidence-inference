On recruitment, the patients were randomized to either the control group or the experimental group using computer-generated random numbers. Baseline demographic and clinical data were collected from the hospital records for all patients included in the study.</p><p>All oral antidiabetics, premixed insulin, and noninsulin injectable antidiabetics were stopped in both the groups. Patient already taking basal-bolus insulin at home was allowed to continue the same with necessary adjustments as per the group allotted to them.</p><p>All patients received fixed carbohydrate meals three times a day. Unless there was a specific reason, all patients received their meals at fixed times of the day.</p><p>In all cases, capillary blood glucose (CBG) monitoring was carried out four times a day (three times before meals and at bedtime) using a glucometer. Our hospital uses glucometers from the same manufacturer in all the wards and it is regularly calibrated. All glucometer readings were informed to a member of the endocrinology team in real-time and also noted on the nursing charts. Data were obtained from these nursing charts by study investigators the next day.</p><p>Adjustments were made to insulin regimen depending on the protocol assigned to the patient. Additional CBG readings were taken if the patient complained of symptoms suggestive of hypoglycemia and/or the treating endocrinologist ordered additional readings. If the additional blood glucose reading was suggestive of hypoglycemia (blood glucose &#x0003c;70 mg/dl) or severe hyperglycemia (blood glucose &#x0003e;300 mg/dl), the readings were counted in the event rate of hypoglycemia or severe hyperglycemia, respectively; however, the readings were not taken to calculate the other glycemic parameters.</p><p>Any cases of hypoglycemia (blood glucose &#x0003c;70 mg/dl) were managed according to the existing protocol developed by the endocrinology department. If patient was given any correction for hypoglycemia, then the blood glucose readings for the rest of the day were discarded from the study.</p><p>If the patient developed any episode of blood glucose &#x0003e;250 mg/dl, urinary ketones were checked. If any patient developed diabetic ketoacidosis (defined as blood glucose &#x0003e;250 mg/dl, urine ketone positive, pH &#x0003c;7.3, and serum bicarbonate &#x0003c;18 mEq/l), it was appropriately managed and that patient was excluded from the study. However, if the patient did not have diabetic ketoacidosis, the hyperglycemic excursion was managed as per the protocol assigned to the patient.</p><p>If the patient developed blood glucose &#x0003e;400 mg/dl without ketoacidosis, the patient was given additional corrective dose of insulin as per the hospital protocol, irrespective of the group he was randomized to, and blood glucose readings for the rest of the day were discarded from the study.

This is also the basis of the current guidelines proposed by the Endocrine Society.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The use of this basal-bolus insulin approach for GCIH is well established, and there is evidence that it is superior to sliding-scale insulin which was used in the past.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>An alternative approach was first proposed by Clore and Thurby-Hay.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] In a review article by Perez <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] a modified version of the above approach has been proposed for the management of GCIH. The basis of the second school of thought is that if we can give a specific insulin simultaneously with the glucocorticoid administration, we would be able to negate the hyperglycemic effect of the glucocorticoid.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] The authors have proposed that the type of insulin we would use for neutralizing the glucocorticoid should have the same peaks and duration of action as the hyperglycemic effect of the glucocorticoid.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] A similar approach is followed by the Australian Diabetes Society guidelines for the management of hyperglycemia in indoor patients.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, the evidence for the second approach is limited.</p><p>Clore and Thurby-Hay[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] first recommended an alternative approach to the management of GCIH. They acknowledged the fact the glucocorticoids primarily increased postprandial blood glucose. However, they differed in the explanation to this phenomenon. It is often believed that the postprandial hyperglycemia seen in GCIH is due to the effect of morning glucocorticoids on the peripheral insulin sensitivity. However, Clore and Thurby-Hay[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] proposed that the reason for the phenomenon was probably the effect of morning glucocorticoid in causing insulin resistance throughout the day, rather than specific a postprandial defect. They gave an analogy of managing diabetes in pregnancy to explain their theory. Pregnant diabetics initially develop postprandial surge just as it is seen with glucocorticoids. However, as the pregnancy advances and the insulin resistance increases, the requirement of basal insulin progressively increases; however, the bolus ratio for meals (insulin: carb ratio) does not change.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>The study done by Burt <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] later in 2011 provides evidence for their theory. The nondiabetic cohort in the study by Burt <italic>et al</italic>., who received glucocorticoids, developed a hyperglycemic peak after 6&#x02013;8 h despite not having a significant postprandial glycemic surge. Their major recommendation which helped us shape our protocol was the use of insulin neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) along with prednisolone. They also recommended that the dose of the insulin NPH should be based on the dose of the prednisolone administered and weight of the patient.</p><p>A number of guidelines recommend the use of NPH along with morning prednisolone. The guidelines by Australian Diabetes Society[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and a recent guideline by the Joint British Diabetes societies[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] endorse similar protocols. Expert reviews on the topic also support the theory.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The Endocrine Society, however, does not endorse this protocol because of lack of evidence.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>As far as the glycemic profile of methylprednisolone is concerned, there is little reason to believe that it is any different from that of prednisolone. Seggelke <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] demonstrated the glycemic profile of morning dose of methylprednisolone in patients with cystic fibrosis. The pattern of glycemia was similar to what we have seen in the studies done for prednisolone.</p><p>One of the unique aspects of our protocol is the use of insulin glargine along with insulin dexamethasone and use of regular human insulin along with hydrocortisone. Our recommendation comes from the studies which have shown the glycemic profile of dexamethasone and hydrocortisone as well as its pharmacokinetics.</p><p>It is well known that dexamethasone has a longer half-life than other glucocorticoids.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Sethi <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] demonstrated that the glycemic effect of dexamethasone starts in about 3 h. Eberhart <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] and Lukins and Manninen[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] showed that glycemic peak due to dexamethasone is at around 9&#x02013;10 h after administration. The glycemic effect of dexamethasone may last as long as 48 h.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Insulin glargine has a longer half-life and a longer duration of effect, and hence, it is a more suitable insulin to administer with the dexamethasone. This was the basis of our recommendation.</p><p>Hydrocortisone has a much shorter half-life as compared to other glucocorticoids. Vila <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] showed that hydrocortisone produced a glycemic peak 2 h after administration in healthy volunteers. Since regular human insulin has peak after 2 h, it is perfect insulin to be administered along with hydrocortisone.</p><p>There are a few published studies which are similar to our study, which have studied and compared various protocols for the management of GCIH. Grommesh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] published a study for the management of GCIH in hospitalized patients. In the study by Grommesh <italic>et al</italic>., NPH was used irrespective of the type of glucocorticoid used, while in our study we used the &#x0201c;corrective insulin&#x0201d; depending on the type of glucocorticoid which was used.</p><p>Ruiz de Adana <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] published a clinical trial comparing insulin glargine versus insulin NPH as basal insulin in patients with GCIH. The protocol used in the experimental group differs from our study. In our study, we used insulin NPH along with prednisolone over and above the basal-bolus insulin (which included insulin glargine). However, in the study published by Ruiz de Adana <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] they have used insulin NPH three times a day before each meal along with the bolus insulin.</p><p>Based on the results of our study, we suggest several recommendations for clinical practice. We recommend that all patients who receive glucocorticoids must have multiple blood glucose measurements for diagnosis of GCIH. We recommend the use of insulin NPH along with prednisolone and methylprednisolone, regular human insulin along with hydrocortisone, and insulin glargine along with dexamethasone as &#x0201c;correctional insulin.&#x0201d; The dose of correctional insulin should be based on the dose of the administered glucocorticoid and weight of the patient. For patients having preexisting diabetes mellitus given glucocorticoids, we recommend using correctional insulin over and above the background basal-bolus insulin regimen. For patients not having preexisting diabetes and developing GCIH, just the correctional insulin dose along with the administered glucocorticoid would suffice.</p><p>Our study had several limitations. We proposed using specific insulin as &#x0201c;correctional insulin&#x0201d; for the management of hyperglycemia induced by dexamethasone and hydrocortisone, which was a unique part of our study. However, the number of patients enrolled in the study who received dexamethasone and hydrocortisone was too less to draw any conclusion based on a subgroup analysis. We did not collect data for the dose of insulin used in the experimental and control group. These data would have helped us understand whether there was a difference in insulin requirement between the two groups.</p><p>Our study could be a primer for the future research on the field of GCIH. We propose dedicated scientific trials on the management of hyperglycemia secondary to dexamethasone, hydrocortisone, and other glucocorticoids. We also recommend that more studies should be conducted on the dysglycemic effects of systemic as well as other forms of glucocorticoids in both normal volunteers and hospitalized patients to understand the risk factors for GCIH and the glycemic patterns of the administered glucocorticoid.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>We developed a new protocol for the management of GCIH among hospitalized patients. The new protocol incorporated the use of &#x0201c;correctional insulin&#x0201d; matching the glycemic profile of the glucocorticoid administered to negate the effect of the glucocorticoid. When compared to the standard basal-bolus insulin protocol, the new protocol showed lower mean blood glucose and lower glycemic variability. The new protocol had lesser episodes of severe hyperglycemia, and the risk of hypoglycemia was negligible.</p><sec id="sec2-9"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec
