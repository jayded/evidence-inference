Its efficacy in social anxiety disorder (SAD) is yet to be established. Aims: We examined the effectiveness of an MCT in patients with SAD. A two group case&#x02013;control design with baseline, post, and 3 months follow-up was adopted. The control group received training in applied relaxation (AR). Four patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual-IV diagnosis of social anxiety were sequentially allotted to receive either MCT or AR. Patients were assessed on postevent processing (PEP), social anxiety, depression, and fear on negative evaluation. Clinical significance was calculated. MCT was more effective than AR in reducing social avoidance, PEP, and self-consciousness. While overall both interventions were effective in reducing social anxiety, MCT was marginally more effective. MCT may be a promising therapeutic approach in the management of SAD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd><italic>applied relaxation</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>metacognitive therapy</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>postevent processing</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>social anxiety</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Social anxiety disorder (SAD) is a debilitating condition[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] characterized by fear of negative evaluation (FNE), scrutiny in social and performance situations and significant avoidance of these situations.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>SAD affects 7-13% of individuals in Western societies across their lifetime, with a greater preponderance of males seeking treatment.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] SAD has early onset,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] with a mean age of onset of 10-13 years and significant co-morbidity.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Cognitive behavioral models describe four processes that maintain social anxiety.

One patient receiving AR showed clinically significant improvement (75%) while the other patient worsened. The magnitude change was significantly higher in patients receiving MCT. These findings indicate that MCT was effective in reducing SFA and PEP, while AR, led to limited changes. Both PEP and self-consciousness maintain social anxiety.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Socially anxious individuals focus excessively on detailed self-observation and monitoring[<xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] thereby increasing self-awareness of anxiety symptoms and enhancing arousal.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Patients receiving MCT acquired skills in identifying the content of self-consciousness and were instructed to shift the focus of attention to external processing. They reported that this helped reduce anxiety. Changes in PEP were observed in the group receiving AR, but these changes were not consistently seen on SFA. The maintenance of gains at follow-up in patients receiving MCT suggests durability of gains. No significant change was seen in patients receiving AR. Thus, while patients receiving AR experienced arousal reduction, in the absence of specific strategies for SFA, there was no further impact. These findings highlight the need for specific strategies for SFA and PEP.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Social anxiety and symptom severity</title><p>Social anxiety was assessed using a self-report version of Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and the CGI-S.

In situation safety behaviors maintain social avoidance by preventing disconfirmation of negative beliefs.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Patients were instructed to drop safety behaviors during exposure, and this may have contributed to decrease in social avoidance. Studies indicate that exposure plus dropping safety behaviors reduces social anxiety and avoidance.[<xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]</p><p>Patients receiving MCT showed significantly greater improvement at postintervention (62.5% and 61.81%) on BFNE as compared to AR (17.94% and 21.625), indicating effectiveness of MCT in producing cognitive change [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>].</p><p>Patients receiving AR showed marginally greater changes than patients receiving MCT at postintervention on BDI-II. However, at 3 months follow-up, these differences were not observed [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. Thus, while anxiety reduction can impact depressive symptoms in the short period, they may not be sufficient to maintain gains, and it is important to address cognitive processes such as PEP that may increase negative affect.</p><p>MCT appears to be a promising approach to social anxiety. As this was a pilot investigation, the sample size was small and did not allow for further statistical analysis and interpretation. The strengths of the study include the use of a manualized protocol, an equal number of therapist contacts, 3 months follow-up and the inclusion of an active comparison group.</p><p>A larger sample would help in building more robust evidence for MCT in SAD.
