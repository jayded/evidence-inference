Tenapanor acts locally in the gut to reduce absorption of sodium and phosphate. It is being developed for the treatment of patients with hyperphosphatemia in CKD requiring dialysis and patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome. We report the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of tenapanor in Japanese volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">In this phase 1, double-blind study (NCT02176252), healthy Japanese adults (aged 20&#x02013;45&#x000a0;years) received single-dose tenapanor 180&#x000a0;mg (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;6), repeated-dose tenapanor 15, 30, 60, or 90&#x000a0;mg twice daily (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12 each) for 7&#x000a0;days, or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;14).

Preclinical and early clinical studies show that tenapanor reduces absorption of sodium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] and phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] from the gut, with a concomitant increase in stool fluid content. Sodium/fluid and phosphate imbalances play a role in many conditions, such as hypertension, heart failure, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], and stool consistency is of relevance in constipation-related disorders.</p><p id="Par7">In an animal model of CKD (5/6 nephrectomized rats fed a high-salt diet), tenapanor treatment provided protective effects on renal function and reduced extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In addition, an animal model of uremic calcification demonstrated that tenapanor treatment reduced vascular calcification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In healthy volunteer studies, tenapanor treatment over 7&#x000a0;days reduced sodium absorption, resulting in increases in stool sodium content of up to 50&#x000a0;mmol (2.9&#x000a0;g table salt) per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">The most recent guidelines on the treatment of patients with CKD from the Japanese Society of Nephrology (published in 2013) recommend restriction of dietary sodium intake to 2.4&#x000a0;g (approximately 6&#x000a0;g table salt) per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and the American Heart Association recommends restriction of sodium intake to 1.5&#x000a0;g (3.8&#x000a0;g table salt) per day in the general population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. There are currently no approved drugs that reduce sodium absorption. Therefore, the only means by which sodium uptake can be controlled is by diet, which is often ineffective.</p><p id="Par9">Tenapanor is being evaluated for the treatment of patients with hyperphosphatemia in CKD requiring dialysis and patients with constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). As a component of its clinical development program, it is important to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of tenapanor in Japanese individuals, so that the agent may be made available for the treatment of patients with these conditions in Japan in the future. Here, we report data from the first study of tenapanor in a Japanese population. This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of tenapanor in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par10">This was a phase 1, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study in healthy Japanese adult volunteers (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02176252). A group of healthy Caucasian individuals was included, primarily to collect further safety data on tenapanor at the highest dose in Caucasian people. The study was conducted at a clinical pharmacology unit (CPU) at WCCT Global, Cypress, CA, USA. The study protocol and consent forms were reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board Aspire IRB, Santee, CA, USA (approval number D5611C00005) before commencement of the study.</p><p id="Par11">After screening, eligible participants were admitted to the CPU 2&#x000a0;days before assignment to treatment. Japanese participants were allocated sequentially in the order of completion of their screening assessments to groups evaluating tenapanor hydrochloride (hereafter referred to as tenapanor) given as a single 180 mg dose or one of four repeated doses (tenapanor 15, 30, 60, or 90&#x000a0;mg twice daily over 7 days). Within the single-dose group, participants were randomly assigned to tenapanor (180&#x000a0;mg) or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Within the repeated-dose groups, participants were randomly assigned to tenapanor or placebo, all twice daily for 7&#x000a0;days, in a 4:1 ratio. Caucasian participants were randomly assigned to either tenapanor 90&#x000a0;mg or placebo, both twice daily for 7&#x000a0;days, in a 4:1 ratio.

Vital signs were recorded before the first dose of study drug, on study days 1 and 2 (all treatment groups), and on day 8 (repeated-dose groups). Physical examinations were conducted at screening, on study day 1 (all groups), on day 8 (repeated-dose groups), and at the follow-up visit (all groups). Digital ECG measurements were recorded on study days 1 and 2 (all groups) and days 7 and 8 (repeated-dose groups). Safety laboratory evaluations (fasting state) were made on study day 1 (all treatment groups), day 2 (single-dose group), and day 8 (repeated-dose groups).</p><p id="Par18">Pharmacodynamic measures included daily stool and urinary sodium and phosphorus content and daily stool frequency, weight, and consistency (as measured by BSFS score on the 7-point scale from type 1 [hard lumps] to type 7 [watery] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]). Bowel movement assessments were performed and daily urine samples collected from the day before assignment to treatment (day &#x02212;1) to the day after receiving the last dose.

(San Diego, CA, USA). Human plasma samples containing tenapanor, its deuterated analog as the internal standard, and dipotassium ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid as the anticoagulant were processed first by protein precipitation followed by back extraction into an acidic aqueous solution. The extracts were injected and analyzed by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography using a Synergi Hydro-RP column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA) maintained at 35&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. The mobile phase was nebulized using heated nitrogen in a Z-spray source/interface set to electrospray positive-ionization mode. The ionized compounds were quantified using mass spectrometry (MS/MS). The lower and upper limits of quantification were 0.5 and 500&#x000a0;ng/mL, respectively. The accuracy (variation in measured concentration compared with theoretical concentration) and precision (coefficient of variation [SD/mean] within replicates) of quality-control standards of tenapanor were determined at concentrations of 0.5, 1.5, 20, and 400&#x000a0;ng/mL. Accuracy and precision were in the ranges of &#x02212;1.5 to 8.0 and 2.8&#x02013;9.1&#x000a0;%, respectively. Precision and accuracy no greater than 20&#x000a0;% were required for quality-control standards at the lower limit of quantification.</p><p id="Par21">Sodium and phosphorus content of stool samples was determined by RTI International (Research Triangle Park, NC, USA). Stool samples were transferred to the laboratory in a frozen state and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C. Samples were partially digested in approximately twice their weight of concentrated nitric acid and then heated at 60&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 3&#x000a0;h; aliquots of the resulting partially digested samples (5&#x000a0;mL) were further digested with nitric and hydrochloric acids and diluted to 50&#x000a0;mL with deionized water, before centrifugation to precipitate insoluble matter. The sodium and phosphorus content of the supernatant liquid was measured using inductively coupled plasma-optical emission spectrometry (iCAP 6500 ICP-OES analyzer, Thermo, USA). The validated lower limit of quantification was defined by the lowest replicate electrolyte concentration that was measured with acceptable accuracy (&#x000b1;20&#x000a0;% of the nominal back-calculated concentration from the calibration curve). At least four of six quality-control standards had to be quantified as within 20&#x000a0;% of their theoretical value for an analysis run to be acceptable. The overall precision and overall bias (a measure of accuracy) of the assay for sodium, as determined by analysis of quality-control standards were in the ranges of 3.2&#x02013;5.8&#x000a0;% and 2.9&#x02013;14.5&#x000a0;%, respectively. The overall precision and overall bias of the assay for phosphorus were in the ranges of 1.9&#x02013;3.3 and 0.4&#x02013;3.8&#x000a0;%, respectively.</p><p id="Par22">Sodium and phosphorus content of urine samples were determined using ion selective electrode measurements by standard clinical laboratory techniques (Consolidated Medical Bioanalysis, Cypress, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p id="Par23">Pharmacodynamic measurements were summarized according to dose group using descriptive statistics, with calculations of daily means and standard deviations across the treatment period. For each participant, mean on-treatment daily stool and urinary sodium and phosphorus content and daily stool frequencies were calculated as the mean of all available measurements following assignment to treatment divided by the number of days of treatment for which measurements were available. For each individual, mean BSFS score and mean stool weight were calculated as the mean for each 24-h period, and the 24-h means over the full treatment period were used to provide the mean daily BSFS score and mean daily stool weight.

Our study, in which participants received a standardized diet, showed that administration of tenapanor over a wide dose range reduced the absorption of dietary sodium and phosphate in Japanese individuals, as demonstrated by increases relative to placebo in stool sodium and phosphorus content and concomitant decreases in urinary sodium and phosphorus content.</p><p id="Par35">With the exception of the lowest dose (15&#x000a0;mg twice daily over 7&#x000a0;days), all other repeated doses of tenapanor (up to 90&#x000a0;mg twice daily over 7&#x000a0;days) resulted in mean daily stool sodium excretion of approximately 30&#x000a0;mmol/day, compared with 4&#x000a0;mmol/day with placebo treatment. Stool sodium excretion of 30&#x000a0;mmol is equivalent to approximately 1.8&#x000a0;g of table salt, or 16&#x000a0;% of the 11.4&#x000a0;g of table salt consumed daily by the study participants. It is important to note, however, that although the mean of stool and urinary electrolyte content was calculated over the whole treatment period, there was large variability in stool sodium content across the cohorts. Less variability across the cohorts was evident with urinary sodium content. Repeated-dose tenapanor resulted in similar stool phosphorus (approximately 18&#x02013;25&#x000a0;mmol/day) and urinary phosphorus (15&#x02013;19&#x000a0;mmol/day) content, irrespective of dose. Tenapanor treatment also resulted in increases in stool frequency and weight and a softer stool consistency.

Tenapanor has also been shown to have an anti-nociceptive effect in an IBS animal model of visceral pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and it is also being evaluated in constipation-predominant IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Results from a phase 2b study of tenapanor indicate that these effects translate into clinically meaningful improvements in constipation and abdominal pain in patients with constipation-predominant IBS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p id="Par41">The safety and tolerability profiles and pharmacodynamic effects of tenapanor seen in this study in Japanese individuals are consistent with those observed in the Caucasian individuals in this study, and also in other healthy volunteers in study populations consisting mainly of Caucasian and African-American participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Our study included a group of Caucasian individuals, who received the highest dose of tenapanor (90&#x000a0;mg twice daily for 7&#x000a0;days), primarily to generate additional safety data at the highest dose, including digital ECG measurements. This is important from a global development perspective. This study found no evidence of any clinically significant effects on digital ECG measurements in either the Japanese or the Caucasian individuals receiving tenapanor. The most common adverse events in individuals receiving tenapanor that were judged by the study investigator as being related to treatment were gastrointestinal in nature, with diarrhea being the most frequent event. The occurrence of adverse events such as diarrhea following tenapanor treatment may be expected, given the pharmacological effect that leads to increased water retention in the gastrointestinal tract. This is also reflected in the observation that tenapanor treatment resulted in softer stools compared with placebo in all treatment groups in this study, which is consistent with data from other healthy volunteer studies of tenapanor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">This study in Japanese participants was conducted in the USA in Japanese people who had lived outside Japan for less than 5&#x000a0;years. It is difficult to judge whether different results would have been obtained if the study had been conducted in Japan because it is unclear whether these individuals had changed their diet since leaving Japan. Notwithstanding these considerations, all participants received a diet standardized for sodium content during the study, including during the run-in period. No other food items, spices, or additional table salt was allowed, thereby ensuring controlled sodium intake. Although the diet was not standardized for phosphate content, all participants did receive the same meals on the same study days, thereby facilitating consistent phosphate intake.</p><p id="Par43">In conclusion, tenapanor treatment resulted in reductions in absorption of sodium and phosphate from the gut in healthy Japanese volunteers. Tenapanor had minimal systemic exposure, was well tolerated, and produced a softer stool consistency. Further evaluation of tenapanor in different patient groups with hyperphosphatemia in CKD requiring dialysis and patients with constipation-predominant IBS is warranted.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec17"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
