This two-part study was randomized, double blind, placebo controlled in patients with moderate-to-severe COPD: Part 1: single-dose escalation, GB 12.5, 25, 50, 100 or 200 &#x003bc;g versus placebo; Part 2: repeat-dose (7-day), four-period crossover, GB 12.5, 25 or 50 &#x003bc;g twice daily (BID) versus placebo, with an open-label extension in which all patients received tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g once daily. On the morning of Day 8 in all five periods, patients also received formoterol 12 &#x003bc;g. In study Part 1, 27 patients were recruited. All GB doses significantly increased from baseline forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) area under the curve (AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub>) and peak FEV<sub>1</sub>, with a trend toward greater efficacy with higher GB dose. All adverse events were mild&#x02013;moderate in severity, with a lower incidence with GB than placebo and no evidence of a dose&#x02013;response relationship. In study Part 2, of 38 patients recruited, 34 completed the study. Adjusted mean differences from placebo in 12 h trough FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 7 (primary) were 115, 142 and 136 mL for GB 12.5, 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g BID, respectively (all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). GB 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g BID were superior (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) to GB 12.5 &#x003bc;g BID for pre-dose morning FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 8. For this endpoint, GB 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g BID were also superior to tiotropium. Compared with Day 7, addition of formoterol significantly increased Day 8 FEV<sub>1</sub> peak and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub> with all GB doses and placebo (all <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). All adverse events were mild&#x02013;moderate in severity and there was no indication of a dose-related relationship. This study provides initial evidence on bronchodilation, safety and pharmacokinetics of extrafine GB BID. Overall, the results suggest that GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID is the optimal dose in patients with COPD.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>glycopyrronium</kwd><kwd>COPD</kwd><kwd>bronchodilator</kwd><kwd>dose-ranging</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by persistent airflow limitation, with long-acting bronchodilators (muscarinic antagonists [LAMAs] or &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists [LABAs]) central to maintenance treatment, either alone or in combination.<xref rid="b1-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> LAMAs such as tiotropium have demonstrated efficacy in a range of measures, including lung function, exacerbations, dyspnea and health status.<xref rid="b2-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> &#x0201c;Open&#x0201d; triple therapy, consisting of a LAMA in one inhaler and an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) plus a LABA in a second, is often used in clinical practice, and is recommended as a treatment option for patients who have the highest level of symptoms and risk of future exacerbations.<xref rid="b1-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Clinical trials have shown a benefit for the addition of a LAMA to an ICS/LABA; in particular, the addition of the LAMA glycopyrronium to a LABA/ICS significantly improved lung function, health status and rescue medication use.<xref rid="b8-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>An extrafine formulation of glycopyrronium bromide (GB) is in development for management of COPD, to be used in a pressurized metered dose inhaler (pMDI) in combination with the ICS beclometasone dipropionate (BDP) and the LABA formoterol fumarate (FF) &#x02013; a &#x0201c;fixed triple&#x0201d;.

Patients who completed study Part 1 were eligible for study Part 2, provided they still met the inclusion and exclusion criteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Trial design</title><p>The two-part study was randomized, double blind and placebo controlled (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> registration: NCT01176903). Part 1 was a two-cohort, single-dose escalation design, with the dose escalated only if the safety and tolerability profile of the lower dose was acceptable. Cohort A was randomized to receive GB 12.5, 50 or 200 &#x003bc;g, via pMDI, or matching placebo; there were three treatment periods separated by washouts of &#x02265;7 days. Cohort B was randomized to receive GB 25 or 100 &#x003bc;g or placebo in two treatment periods. Treatment sequences were defined to ensure a 10:2 ratio between GB and placebo in each period.</p><p>Part 2, which started only after a positive evaluation of safety data from Part 1, was repeat-dose, four-period crossover design, followed by an open-label extension period. In the first four (core) periods, patients were randomized to receive GB 12.5, 25 or 50 &#x003bc;g, or matching placebo, twice daily (BID) for 7 days (total daily doses of 25, 50 and 100 &#x003bc;g), with a further dose on the morning of Day 8. In the fifth (extension) period, all patients received tiotropium 18 &#x003bc;g once daily (OD) for 8 days, open-label via the manufacturer&#x02019;s single-dose dry powder inhaler. On the morning of Day 8 in all five treatment periods, patients also received a single dose of formoterol 12 &#x003bc;g via pMDI. Treatment periods were separated by a 7&#x000b1;2 day washout.</p><p>Patients were assigned to treatment sequences according to randomization lists prepared by the study sponsor. Patients, investigators and site staff, monitors, and the sponsor&#x02019;s clinical team were all blinded to GB and placebo treatment.</p><sec><title>Visit schedule</title><p>After completing the screening visit, eligible patients entered a 7-day run-in, when LAMAs and LABAs were discontinued; LAMAs were replaced with ipratropium four times a day (withheld from 24 h before each study visit until the end of the treatment period) and LABAs were replaced with salbutamol as needed (prn). All patients were permitted salbutamol prn during the treatment periods, with a 6 h washout prior to any pulmonary function test. ICS use was permitted throughout the study, provided the dose had been stable for &#x02265;4 weeks prior to entry (patients taking ICS/LABA fixed combination were prescribed ICS at an equivalent dose plus salbutamol prn).</p><p>In study Part 1, lung function was assessed pre-dose, and 15, 30 and 45 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 12.5 and 24 h post-dose. In study Part 2, lung function was assessed pre-dose on Day 1, and pre-dose and 15, 30 and 45 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h post-dose on days 7 and 8. Blood samples were collected for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis on days 1 and 7 of study Part 2 at pre-dose and at 5, 10, 15 and 30 min and 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 12 h post-dose, and pre-dose on Day 6.

Safety and tolerability was assessed by adverse events (AEs), ECGs (12-lead and 24 h Holter), vital signs and laboratory tests. The PK profile of GB was analyzed after single (on Day 1) and repeated administration (ie, at steady state, assessed on Day 7).</p><p>An exploratory objective was to evaluate the additive effect of single-dose formoterol over GB; the difference between 8 and 7 days (ie, with and without formoterol) in peak FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub> normalized by time and 12 h trough FEV<sub>1</sub> was determined.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>There was no formal power calculation for study Part 1, as this was primarily performed for safety evaluation.

This formulation was well tolerated in both parts of the study. Study Part 2 was a multiple-dose, BID-dosing, crossover study that provided important efficacy data; on Day 7, 25 &#x003bc;g BID was the lowest to meet the predefined threshold for clinical relevance for the primary endpoint (12 h trough FEV<sub>1</sub>) with a difference of &#x02265;120 mL from placebo.</p><p>The dose response for GB in study Part 2 was also evaluated by considering the FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub> and peak FEV<sub>1</sub> on Day 7. Consistent with the primary endpoint showing improvement of &#x02265;120 mL compared to placebo for GB 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g BID, but not 12.5 &#x003bc;g BID, peak FEV<sub>1</sub> showed a significantly greater improvement with GB 25 &#x003bc;g compared to 12.5 &#x003bc;g BID. The FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub> on Day 7 showed no significant difference between the GB doses, although numerically, the effect of GB 12.5 &#x003bc;g BID was the lowest. Overall, these data indicate that GB 25 and 50 &#x003bc;g BID caused greater lung function improvement than GB 12.5 &#x003bc;g BID, a finding supported by the Day 8 trough FEV<sub>1</sub> analysis of GB compared to tiotropium. This suggests that GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID in this formulation may provide at least similar efficacy to tiotropium. This is consistent with data for the dry powder formulation of glycopyrronium, in which 50 &#x003bc;g OD was comparable to tiotropium in terms of lung function, dyspnea and health status.<xref rid="b11-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Overall, therefore, these results suggest that GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID is the optimal dose in patients with COPD.</p><p>The bronchodilator effects of inhaled glycopyrronium have been studied using both once and twice a day administration, with one study showing little difference between these regimens when the same daily dose was administered entirely in the morning or divided between morning and evening.<xref rid="b12-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The results reported here for twice a day administration are consistent with those for a porous particle pMDI formulation (in development for twice daily dosing), in which a single 28.8 &#x003bc;g dose resulted in differences from placebo of 158 mL in peak FEV<sub>1</sub> and ~140 mL in FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub>.<xref rid="b13-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Given that we sought to evaluate the dose&#x02013;response of GB, we enriched the population with individuals with a greater response to muscarinic blockade, identified by an increase in FEV<sub>1</sub> &#x02265;100 mL following inhalation of ipratropium at screening. Similar inclusion criteria have often been used in other early-phase clinical trials of novel LAMA formulations.<xref rid="b14-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This potentially limits the generalizability of the findings to a wider population, but this aspect can be addressed in later-phase clinical trials of longer duration with larger samples sizes. Furthermore, we used a tiotropium arm in order to help select GB doses that would be more likely to achieve at least comparable lung function improvements to those achieved with a commonly used LAMA.</p><p>The addition of a single dose of formoterol was associated with significant increases in peak FEV<sub>1</sub>, FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;12h</sub> and 12 h trough FEV<sub>1</sub> for all treatments. Although this study only investigated bronchodilation, other studies have demonstrated the broad clinical benefits of combining long-acting bronchodilators, either in separate devices<xref rid="b16-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="b17-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> or as a fixed combination in the same inhaler,<xref rid="b18-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> in terms of dyspnea,<xref rid="b18-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b21-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="b24-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> exercise endurance time<xref rid="b22-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and health status.<xref rid="b19-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b23-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b28-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></p><p>Triple therapy with LABA, LAMA and ICS has shown additional advantages to patients in terms of bronchodilation, dyspnea and exacerbations,<xref rid="b8-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b29-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b32-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> and is one of the most commonly prescribed maintenance treatments for COPD.<xref rid="b33-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> A combination of BDP and FF is currently available in the same device as used for GB in this study (Foster<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Chiesi Farmaceutici S.p.A., Parma, Italy) and has a BID dosing regimen. A logical development is, therefore, the co-formulation of BDP/FF and GB in the same inhaler.<xref rid="b9-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Furthermore, the extrafine formulation has potential advantages over conventional large particle standard formulations in that it allows higher total lung deposition as well as for deeper and more uniform distribution within the airways.<xref rid="b34-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>An unusual characteristic of the population recruited into both parts of this study is the high proportion of female patients. Most interventional clinical trials in COPD have recruited predominantly male populations &#x02013; and as a consequence, much of the data available on the efficacy of bronchodilators is generated from men. Although a number of epidemiology studies have identified gender influences on the risk or progression of COPD,<xref rid="b35-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b37-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> post hoc analyses of clinical trials suggest that gender does not seem to influence the response to bronchodilators.<xref rid="b38-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="b39-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></p><p>In the PK analyses, plasma concentration, systemic exposure and urinary excretion all increased with increasing dose &#x02013; in most cases, the increase being proportional to GB dose. This is also consistent with the PK analysis of the dry powder glycopyrronium formulation, dosed OD.<xref rid="b40-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The main purpose of study Part 1 was to provide safety data in order to allow continuation to study Part 2 for efficacy analysis. Study Part 1 showed that a single dose (200 &#x003bc;g), greater than doses used in study Part 2, had a good overall safety and tolerability profile. Few AEs were considered related to treatment, and no SAEs were reported during GB treatment in either part of the study. There was no evidence of a dose&#x02013;response in terms of the AE occurrence in either part of the study &#x02013; although it should be noted that the study was not designed to evaluate such a dose&#x02013;response (this would probably require much higher doses to be administered for a longer period). In addition, the exclusion criteria, typical of Phase II studies, meant that patients with clinically significant comorbidities were excluded from participation, and so, confirmation of the observed good overall safety and tolerability profile would need further studies in wider populations. However, in longer-term studies, inhaled GB (in a different formulation) has demonstrated an overall good safety profile.<xref rid="b11-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b41-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>,<xref rid="b42-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></p><p>Although this study was relatively small and a short-term one, two studies have been conducted that provide long-term evidence on the efficacy and safety of GB 25 &#x003bc;g BID as part of a fixed triple combination of BDP/FF/GB.<xref rid="b9-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The study reported here was focused on lung function in order to identify the optimum dose for later-phase studies with larger sample sizes and longer duration that could also evaluate symptoms and exacerbations.<xref rid="b9-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b10-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b43-copd-12-2001" ref-type="bibr">43</xref></p><p>In conclusion, this study provides initial evidence of the bronchodilator efficacy and safety and tolerability profile of this extrafine formulation of GB.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><sec><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>Subjects had to meet all of the following inclusion criteria (applicable for study Parts 1 and 2):
