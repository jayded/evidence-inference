HCV infection is characterized by the establishment of chronic hepatitis in approximately 70&#x02013;85% of the infected individuals, among whom many develop hepatocellular carcinoma, liver cirrhosis, and liver failure, leading to liver transplantation [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Eventually, these end-stage liver diseases cause substantial morbidity and mortality [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>HCV was recently classified into 7 genotypes and 82 subtypes [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. HCV subtypes 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3a are distributed globally, while all the other subtypes are largely restrictive to certain geographic regions. Genotype 6 and its subtypes are mainly found in Southeast Asia and is the most common genotype in Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Of the 7 genotypes, HCV genotype 6 (HCV-6) is the most diverse and includes 24 subtypes; HCV-6a is the most common subtype, accounting for 17% of HCV infections in Southeast Asia and 27% in Hong Kong [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Studies in Southern China report that HCV-6a accounts for 49.7% of cases detected in blood donors and 51.5% of cases in intravenous drug users; furthermore, its overall proportion is increasing [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Viral eradication is the therapeutic paradigm for chronic hepatitis C; this aims to delay liver disease progression and reduce the rates of liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The modern standard of care for chronic hepatitis C in Western countries is sofosbuvir-based non-interferon (IFN) combination therapy [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, data on HCV-6 are scarce. In the phase III NEUTRINO trial, 6 treatment-na&#x000ef;ve patients with HCV-6 were treated with sofosbuvir (400 mg daily) plus peginterferon (PEG-IFN) &#x003b1;-2a (180 &#x003bc;g/week) and weight-based ribavirin (RBV) (1,000&#x02013;1,200 mg once daily) for 12 weeks; all achieved a sustained virological response (SVR) [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, no available data support the use of a non-PEG-IFN regimen for patients with an HCV-6 infection.</p><p>Non-PEG-IFN direct-acting antiviral agents are not expected to be widely available in Asia in the near future. PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy is still the standard of care in most Asian countries, including China. Fortunately, because of the highly favorable interleukin (IL)-28B genotype (CC genotype rs12979860 in 75.1&#x02013;84.1%) [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], the reported SVR rate in patients with chronic hepatitis C in Asia treated with PEG-IFN/RBV regimens (61&#x02013;79%) is higher than that in Caucasians receiving PEG-IFN/RBV or triple regimens containing HCV protease inhibitors (38&#x02013;41%) [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>In the era of PEG-IFN/RBV, the treatment duration in patients with chronic hepatitis C is tailored according to the HCV genotype and treatment response. A rapid virological response (RVR) is the best predictor of SVR to HCV treatment [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Furthermore, several studies have demonstrated that shorter treatment durations (i.e., 12 or 16 weeks) of PEG-IFN/RBV are as effective as a 24-week regimen for HCV-2/3 patients who have achieved an RVR [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Among patients who were infected with HCV-1 who have lower baseline virus levels and RVR, SVR is equivalent between 24 and 48 weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV treatment [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>A recent study indicates chronic HCV-6 patients show response rates similar to those of HCV-3 patients [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, several studies have compared 24- and 48-week PEG-IFN treatments to chronic HCV-6. However, these studies were small and rarely involved in response-guided therapy [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, this prospective multicenter randomized trial focused on HCV-6a, as determined by the phylogenetic analysis of HCV sequences. We hypothesized that 24 weeks of PEG-IFN/RBV treatment is sufficient for achieving an SVR rate comparable to that of the standard 48-week regimen in HCV-6a patients who have achieved an RVR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Patient selection</title><p>From January 2011 to June 2014, treatment-na&#x000ef;ve Chinese patients with chronic hepatitis C between 18 and 70 years old at four liver centers in Southern China were enrolled.

RVR, which was defined as undetectable HCV RNA (&#x0003c;50 IU/mL) at week 4 of PEG-IFN/RBV therapy, was achieved in 72.4% of patients who were infected with HCV-6. Moreover, HCV-6 patients who achieved RVR also achieved a high SVR rate of &#x0003e;88% in the ITT analysis, which was even higher (&#x0003e;95%) in the per-protocol analysis.</p><p>Approximately 24&#x02013;27% and 64&#x02013;86% of patients with HCV-1 and HCV-2/3 achieved an RVR, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; moreover, 42&#x02013;46% and 76&#x02013;82% achieved an SVR, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The outcomes of HCV-6 patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV were superior to those of HCV-1 patients [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] and were comparable to those of HCV-2/3 patients; the RVR and SVR rates of HCV-6 patients were &#x0003e;70% and 60&#x02013;90%, respectively [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. The findings from the present study corroborate these findings.</p><p>HCV-6 is confined to Southeast Asia, Hong Kong, and Southern China where people tend to have a lower BMI, consume less alcohol, and have more favorable IL-28B genotypes than people from Western countries do. Most patients in the present study had a BMI &#x0003c;24 kg/m<sup>2</sup> and had an rs12979860 CC genotype. These factors may contribute to the high RVR and SVR rates of the HCV-6 patients in these regions [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. However, it remains unclear whether the high SVR in the HCV-6 patients is due to viral factors alone or host factors as well.</p><p>The optimal treatment duration of HCV-6 patients remains controversial. A retrospective cohort study by Nguyen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] showed that 48-week PEG-IFN/RBV treatment results were associated with a significantly higher SVR rate than 24-week treatment (75% vs. 39%). In contrast, in a randomized controlled study by Lam et al. [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>], 60 HCV-6 patients were randomized to 24- or 48-week treatment, but the SVR rates were comparable (79% vs. 70%); however, the RVR rate in the 24-week treatment group tended to be higher than that in the 48-week group (17/20 vs. 12/19), which may significantly narrow the difference in the SVR rate between the groups. In a randomized controlled study published in 2012, 105 HCV-6 patients were randomized to 48-week or 24-week PEG-IFN/RBV treatment; there was no significant difference in SVR between the groups (71% vs. 60%); that study performed post hoc subgroup comparisons of the SVR rates in patients who achieved RVR but found no significant difference [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. However, because of the superiority trial design and the small sample of RVR patients involved, the study did not claim the non-inferiority of 24-week PEG-IFN &#x003b1;-2a/RBV treatment compared to 48-week treatment.</p><p>The present study was designed on the basis of the non-inferiority principle. We published ITT analysis findings, because this is the standard methodology for presenting data in a randomized controlled trial. However, for a non-inferiority study, PP analysis provides more stringent and empirical results. Therefore, the present study claimed that 24-week PEG-IFN/RBV treatment is non-inferior to 48-week treatment for HCV-6 patients who achieve an RVR.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that the treatment outcomes of chronic hepatitis C are associated with the genotype, HCV RNA viral load, age, sex, BMI, metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, alcohol consumption, and liver disease characteristics, including ALT and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels, fibrosis stage, and co-infection with another hepatotropic virus or HIV [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p><p>Besides the HCV genotype, one of the most robust baseline predictors of SVR is the baseline HCV RNA load. A recent randomized trial by Yu et al. demonstrated that in HCV-1 patients with low viremia and RVR, 24- and 48-week treatments resulted in similar SVR rates, but 24-week PEG-IFN/RBV treatment was inferior to 48-week treatment in patients with high viremia, even if they achieved an RVR. In patients with HCV-2/3, shorter PEG-IFN/RBV treatment durations from 12&#x02013;16 weeks are as effective as a 24-week regimen when an RVR is achieved [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. However, a recent large trial on HCV-2/3 patients showed that 24 weeks is superior to 16 weeks in patients with high viremia [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Moreover, because different studies choose different cut-offs as high or low [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>], it is very difficult to define the exact level at which a patients&#x02019; likelihood of SVR will be diminished, which makes it difficult to risk-stratify or prognosticate the patient&#x02019;s chances for achieving SVR based on the level of viremia in clinical practice. Until recently, the predictive value of baseline viremia for HCV-6 patients treated with PEG-IFN/RBV has not been clarified in any large clinical studies.</p><p>In this study, the SVR rate was equivalent with 24 and 48 weeks of treatment, even in subgroups stratified according to the HCV RNA level. This indicates that RVR can serve as a guide for tailoring the treatment duration of PEG-IFN/RBV for HCV-6.</p><p>IL-28B polymorphisms are associated with SVR and RVR to PEG-IFN/RBV treatment in HCV-1 [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and HCV-2/3 [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. However, IL-28B genomic-based treatment paradigms for chronic hepatitis C infection need to be demonstrated in clinical trials. Owing to the geographical distribution of HCV-6, data on the predictive value of IL-28B in HCV-6 are scarce. In this study, the SVR rate did not differ with respect to the IL-28B rs12979860 genotype (CC vs. non-CC). This finding implies that RVR itself can objectively help to determine whether a patient should receive a 24- or 48-week course of PEG-IFN/RBV treatment. This would also minimize the need to perform IL28 genotyping in all patients, which is more likely to be more costly than monitoring RVR to help guide treatment.</p><p>As the distribution of the CC IL-28B genotype may be more common in Asian patients than the CT and TT genotypes, the predictive value of IL-28B for HCV-6 needs to be demonstrated in a larger trial.</p><p>The most common adverse events were general non-specific symptoms and hematological abnormalities; all were mild and manageable with supportive measures. A few required treatment dose reduction or interruption until the blood test results returned to normal. Only a few patients with severe adverse events were discontinued permanently. As reported in previous HCV treatment trials, the incidence and types of adverse events due to PEG-IFN/RBV therapy appear to be similar among patients with different HCV genotypes, but they differ with respect to ethnicity [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Hu et al. reported that compared to Caucasian and Hispanic patients, Asian patients tend to have anemia more frequently and fewer psychiatric adverse events [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Subsequent studies reported no significant differences between Caucasians and Asians with respect to the required RBV or PEG-IFN dose reductions [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Because of the geographic distribution of HCV-6, the adverse event profiles in the present study were quite similar to those of clinical trials from Asia but were different from those in Western studies [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. In this study, mild anemia was more common in the 48-week group, which is probably due to the longer exposure to RBV. However, no difference was found between groups with respect to non-specific symptoms, anemia (&#x0003c;10 g/dL), severe anemia (&#x0003c;8.5 g/dL), treatment discontinuation, or dose reduction. This may be because most adverse events occur in the early treatment phase. Shortening the treatment duration did not substantially decrease the prevalence of adverse events. Nevertheless, shortening the suffering of adverse effect would substantially improve patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p>Generally, the present study adds to our knowledge of patients with hepatitis C and genotype 6 which is the most common genotype in Southeast Asia where disease burden is very high, but has been a relatively neglected area in the literature. Currently, PEG-IFN/RBV combination therapy is still the standard of care in most Asian countries, including China. The findings in the present study will greatly help to optimize the treatment regimen for HCV-6a patients in Asian countries where non-PEG-IFN direct-acting antiviral agents are not expected to be widely available in the near future.</p><p>One limitation of the present study was that only patients from Southern China were enrolled; thus, a diverse culture and lifestyle from a different country might influence the study findings. Furthermore, patients in the current study were much younger and had less severe liver fibrosis than patients from other clinical trials did [<xref rid="pone.0140853.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0140853.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. These differences in the patients&#x02019; characteristics may account for the high SVR observed in the current study, because older age and more severe liver fibrosis are associated with a lower likelihood of achieving SVR. Moreover, 31 patients withdrew after enrollment with unknown reasons. Thirty two patients had no HCVRNA result at week 4 of treatment. In conclusion, 24-week PEG-IFN/RBV treatment was non-inferior to 48-week treatment for HCV-6 patients in Southern China who achieved an RVR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec018"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140853.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><title>CONSORT Checklist.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140853.s001.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140853.s002"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Primary ethical approval.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140853.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140853.s003"><label>S1 File</label><caption><title>Dataset</title><p>.</p><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140853.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140853.s004"><label>S1 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol in English.</title><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140853.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140853.s005"><label>S2 Protocol</label><caption><title>Protocol in Chinese.doc.</title><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140853.s005.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0140853.s006"><label>S1 Text</label><caption><title>Translation of ethical approval.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0140853.s006.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCV</term><def><p>hepatitis C virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ITT</term><def><p>intention to treat</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KPa</term><def><p>kilopascal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEG-IFN</term><def><p>peginterferon</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PP</term><def><p>per protocol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RBV</term><def><p>ribavirin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RVR</term><def><p>rapid virological response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SVR</term><def><p>sustained virological response</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0140853.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
