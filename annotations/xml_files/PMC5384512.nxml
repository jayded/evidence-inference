In the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision, the conditions are classified as disorders of sexual desire (hypoactive sexual desire disorder [HSDD]), sexual arousal (female sexual arousal disorder [FSAD]), orgasm (delay or absence) or sexual pain (dyspareunia or vaginismus) [<xref rid="bibr1-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Other conceptualizations view the conditions as overlapping comorbidities [<xref rid="bibr2-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Indeed, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition, replaces HSDD and FSAD with a new diagnostic category, female sexual interest/arousal disorder [<xref rid="bibr4-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In a US national household survey of adult sexual behavior conducted in 1992, the overall prevalence of sexual dysfunction among women 18&#x02013;59 years old was 43% [<xref rid="bibr5-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Moreover, all types of sexual dysfunction (low sexual desire, arousal disorder and sexual pain) exhibited strong associations with low feelings of satisfaction and happiness. Another US national household survey, conducted in 2006 [<xref rid="bibr6-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], reported the prevalence of &#x02018;any sexual problem&#x02019; among women &#x02265;18 years old to be 43%. The prevalence of &#x02018;any distressing sexual problem&#x02019; (with a score &#x02265;15 on the female sexual distress scale [FSDS] [<xref rid="bibr7-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]) was 12.0%. Women in the 45&#x02013;64-year-old group also had a higher prevalence of distressing low sexual desire (12.3%) and arousal (7.5%) than women 18&#x02013;44 years old or &#x02265;65 years old [<xref rid="bibr6-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Distress is a defining and common characteristic of these disorders and may lead to consultation and treatment seeking, especially if safe and effective pharmacotherapy is available.</p><p>Bremelanotide (BMT) is a novel cyclic 7-aminoacid melanocortin-receptor agonist with high affinity for the type-4 receptor [<xref rid="bibr8-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], giving it a potential to modulate brain pathways involved in sexual response [<xref rid="bibr9-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. For example, melanocortinergic neurons may stimulate dopamine release in the medial preoptic area, a locus implicated in the sexual behavior of both sexes of several species [<xref rid="bibr10-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In hormone-primed female rats, BMT administered systemically, by infusion into the lateral ventricles or directly into the medial preoptic area significantly and selectively increased the appetitive sexual behaviors used by females to entice males into sexual activity, such as solicitations, hops and darts and mounting [<xref rid="bibr10-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Clinical studies have documented the penile erectogenic efficacy of BMT in healthy men and in men with erectile dysfunction [<xref rid="bibr12-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In a placebo-controlled feasibility study of its potential use for FSD, significantly more premenopausal women with FSAD reported moderate or high sexual desire after intranasal dosing of a BMT formulation, with a trend toward greater feelings of genital arousal [<xref rid="bibr14-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. A 2-month Phase II trial evaluated an intranasal BMT formulation in pre- and post-menopausal women with FSAD. Significant treatment effects were observed for satisfying sexual events (SSEs), desire and arousal [<xref rid="bibr15-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The present Phase IIB trial was designed to explore the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous BMT in a well-characterized population of premenopausal women with HSDD, FSAD or both, and identify appropriate doses for Phase III registration trials. Based on prior clinical studies [<xref rid="bibr12-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr15-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and pharmacokinetic modeling, subcutaneous doses of 0.75, 1.25 and 1.75 mg were selected.

Prior to study procedures, written informed consent was obtained from each patient. After a no-treatment month to confirm diagnoses, each patient self-administered, under clinical research staff supervision, a single-blind, in-clinic placebo dose, followed by 1-week monitoring. Patients then entered a 4-week period of single-blind, at-home placebo self-dosing, to establish each patient's baseline. By an interactive voice/web response system, patients were then randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio, with stratification by diagnosis (FSAD, HSDD or mixed FSAD/HSDD), to double-blind placebo or BMT 0.75, 1.25 or 1.75 mg. The double-blind treatment began with two self-administered in-clinic study-drug doses spaced approximately 1 week apart. This was followed by 12 weeks of at-home, as-desired self-dosing approximately 45 min prior to anticipated sexual activity (not exceeding one dose per day or 16 doses during a 4-week period). During this study phase, patients were assessed every 4 weeks.

HSDD was the primary diagnosis in 63% of the women and the sole diagnosis in another 23%. In exploratory analyses, the outcomes of BMT use in women with HSDD as either their primary or their sole diagnosis (i.e., HSDD with or without decreased arousal) resembled those in the study's full mITT population, including dose-related improvements on multiple FSD measures, with statistical significance versus placebo at 1.75 mg and at 1.25/1.75 mg pooled.</p><p>The design of the study was also notable for including, prior to randomization, a 4-week single-blind placebo self-dosing period. The observed placebo responses were not employed to exclude any patients from further study participation, as would be the case in a study with an enrichment design. Rather, they served to set rigorous baselines for the study's efficacy and ABPM analyses.</p><p>In general, BMT was safe and well tolerated. During double-blind treatment, nausea was reported by 64 BMT users, or 22% of 296, compared with three placebo users or 3% of 98, but caused the withdrawal of only three BMT users. Vomiting was reported by 12 BMT users, or 4%, compared with no placebo users, but caused the withdrawal of only three of these patients. Flushing was reported by 48 BMT users, or 16%, compared with no placebo users, but caused the withdrawal of only two patients.

All treatments, potential and approved, have individual safety and efficacy profiles that may make them inappropriate or inadequate for clinical use by some patients. For such persons, a medical therapy with an alternate mechanism of action and safety profile could be a valuable option. The additional flexibility of a therapy with as-desired dosing would also have value for patients who prefer not to use an agent that must be taken chronically. The continued clinical evaluation of BMT may provide an efficacious, well-tolerated, episodically dosed alternative for women with FSD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section17-whe-2016-0018"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In premenopausal women with HSDD, FSAD or both conditions, double-blind BMT self-administered subcutaneously on an at-home, as-desired basis over 12 weeks showed significant efficacy versus placebo, as demonstrated by an increase in the monthly number of SSEs (the study's primary outcome measure) and by multiple other measures, both episodic and longer-term (longitudinal), with robust consistency. Although SSEs are a downstream measure of treatment effect [<xref rid="bibr36-whe-2016-0018" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], the study's end points also included direct demonstration of increased sexual desire and arousal and decreased distress. Effective dosing with 1.25 and 1.75 mg was established. The dose of 0.75 mg did not differ from placebo (ineffective dose). The findings of this large Phase IIB trial provide further evidence of the safety and efficacy of BMT in premenopausal patients with FSAD and/or HSDD, and suggest that ongoing Phase III registration trials may confirm BMT as a significant as-desired treatment in this important, underserved patient population.</p><sec id="section19-whe-2016-0018"><title>Ethical conduct of research</title><p>The authors state that they have obtained appropriate institutional review board approval or have followed the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki for all human or animal experimental investigations.
