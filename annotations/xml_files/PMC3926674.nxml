Spasticity is a significant contributor to the secondary impairments impacting functional performance and participation. The most common lower limb spasticity management is focal intramuscular injections of Botulinum Toxin-Type A accompanied by individually-delivered (one on one) physiotherapy rehabilitation. With increasing emphasis on improving goal-directed functional activity and participation within a family-centred framework, it is timely to explore whether physiotherapy provided in a group could achieve comparable outcomes, encouraging providers to offer flexible models of physiotherapy delivery. This study aims to compare individual to group-based physiotherapy following intramuscular Botulinum Toxin-A injections to the lower limbs for ambulant children with cerebral palsy aged four to fourteen years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>An assessor-masked, block randomised comparison trial will be conducted with random allocation to either group-based or individual physiotherapy. A sample size of 30 (15 in each study arm) will be recruited. Both groups will receive six hours of direct therapy following Botulinum Toxin-A injections in either an individual or group format with additional home programme activities (three exercises to be performed three times a week). Study groups will be compared at baseline (T1), then at 10 weeks (T2, efficacy) and 26 weeks (T3, retention) post Botulinum Toxin-A injections. Primary outcomes will be caregiver/s perception of and satisfaction with their child&#x02019;s occupational performance goals (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure) and quality of gait (Edinburgh Visual Gait Score) with a range of secondary outcomes across domains of the International Classification of Disability, Functioning and Health.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This paper outlines the study protocol including theoretical basis, study hypotheses and outcome measures for this assessor-masked, randomised comparison trial comparing group versus individual models of physiotherapy following intramuscular injections of Botulinum Toxin-A to the lower limbs for ambulant children with cerebral palsy.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ANZCTR.org.au/ACTRN12611000454976.aspx">ACTRN12611000454976</ext-link></p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Botulinum Toxin-A</kwd><kwd>Cerebral palsy</kwd><kwd>Group physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Models of training</kwd><kwd>Physiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>Assessor-masked randomised comparison trial</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of physical disability in childhood with an incidence of 2.11 per 1000 live births [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It describes a &#x0201c;group of permanent disorders of the development of movement and posture, causing activity limitations that are attributed to non-progressive disturbances that occurred in the developing fetal or infant brain&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In 2013, the Australian Cerebral Palsy Register reported that 71% of children with CP achieved ambulation and 91% were classified with spasticity as the predominant motor type. Children with lower limb spasticity often experience a range of impairments including weakness, tightness, reduced motor control and muscle selectivity. These impairments can lead to limitations in functional ability, balance, ambulation and fitness compared to typically developing peers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Physiotherapy intervention focuses on reducing these impairments and optimising functional, goal-related performance.</p><p>Focal, intramuscular Botulinum Toxin-Type A (BoNT-A) injections to the lower limb are commonly used in combination with physiotherapy as the temporary reduction in spasticity provides an opportunity to facilitate rehabilitation outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. For ambulant children with CP (Gross Motor Functional Classification System, GMFCS-E&#x00026;R, Levels I-III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]), there is strong evidence that injections of BoNT-A are safe and reduce muscle tone in spastic, active and non-fibrotic lower limb muscles for approximately 12&#x02013;16&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. BoNT-A impacts body structure and function, however the accompanying physiotherapy often targets activity level outcomes (International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health, ICF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]).</p><p>Functional improvement in ambulant children with CP has been reported in a number of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intramuscular lower limb BoNT-A injections with rehabilitation (physiotherapy, casting and/or orthotic management), to a control group of rehabilitation alone with or without placebo injections. Rehabilitation combined with BoNT-A injections demonstrated significantly greater improvement in gross motor function as measured by the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88 or-66) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and quality of gait using the Physician&#x02019;s Rating Scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], Edinburgh Visual Gait Score (EVGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or Three Dimensional Gait Analysis (3DGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Improvement in performance-related goals have been reported when measured by the Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] or parental questionnaires [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>].</p><p>Despite the acknowledged success of physiotherapy rehabilitation combined with BoNT-A injections, relative effectiveness of the specific components of physiotherapy rehabilitation, including intensity and dose, is difficult to interpret because it is often poorly described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Results of a number of systematic reviews and consensus papers found limited evidence to support or refute individual physiotherapy modalities post lower limb BoNT-A injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The content of physiotherapy rehabilitation outlined in reported studies has included: active and passive stretching of muscle agonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; functional or resistive strengthening of the antagonists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; functional mobility training and/or gait training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. One retrospective, controlled intervention study has directly compared the specific content of two physiotherapy approaches following lower limb BoNT-A injections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Thirty-eight children with CP (mean age 7 years, 7 months, GMFCS I-III, 11 unilateral, 27 bilateral motor distribution) who received Neurodevelopmental Treatment (NDT, mean total dose 24.2&#x000a0;hours) were randomly selected and retrospectively matched to a group of children who received conventional physiotherapy (CPT, mean total dose 20.5&#x000a0;hours). Content of physiotherapy, determined via therapist questionnaires, and improvement of impairment and gait-related goals (GAS) were compared between groups two months post injection. Both approaches utilized muscle tone inhibition techniques, stretching, strengthening and functional training, with the NDT group spending a greater proportion of time on functional training (NDT 42%; CPT 28%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.009). Whilst the NDT group showed greater goal attainment post intervention (mean converted GAS score NDT 56, CPT 52, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008), results should be interpreted cautiously. Therapy content was only described and analysed for 62% (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;47) of children due to reduced completion of questionnaires by treating physiotherapists. As GAS goals were impairment-based it is unclear from this study if a more functional approach to training translates to improvement in goals related to function and participation.</p><p>In the absence of high level evidence, expert opinion and consensus statements recommend post BoNT-A physiotherapy includes functional and targeted motor training in combination with serial casting, stretching and strengthening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Additionally, intervention should incorporate: (1) collaborative, individualized, realistic and specific goal setting which span across all domains of the ICF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; (2) specificity of task and training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]; (3) repetition and practise within a functional &#x0201c;just right&#x0201d; context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]; (4) environmental adaption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] and (5) strategies to increase motivation and engagement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. This approach will facilitate rehabilitation focused on each child&#x02019;s specific goals and functional needs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Studies investigating the efficacy of physiotherapy combined with BoNT-A injections have consistently included therapy delivered in an individual model. It is unclear whether similar outcomes could be achieved using alternative methods of physiotherapy delivery.</p><p>Four models of therapy delivery have been reported in the literature for children with CP including: (1) individual (one on one); (2) group-based (three or more participants with similar abilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>]); (3) web-based training or virtual reality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]; (4) individual consultation with intervention performed as a home programme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Group-based training has been shown to achieve positive rehabilitation outcomes through maximising engagement, motivation and participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Relative effectiveness of group versus individual physiotherapy post lower limb BoNT-A injections has not been examined to date, however. Independent of BoNT-A, effectiveness of group versus standard individualised care has been compared for ambulant children with CP receiving strength, endurance and fitness training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], progressive functional strength training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>] and goal-directed activity-focused physiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Results are difficult to compare due to the heterogeneity of theoretical focus, therapy dose and outcome measures used. However, these studies provide useful guidelines for the elements that contribute to successful group-based physiotherapy.</p><p>Effective group-based physiotherapy interventions report similar session structure including warm up, specific intervention activities and then warm down. To maintain motivation and specificity of practise, a combination of group-based activity and individual or paired circuit activity has been recommended [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. To ensure adequate supervision and progression of exercises, group sizes have been limited to small (4&#x02013;6 children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] or medium (7&#x02013;9 children) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Effective dose is not well understood due to variability in intensity, frequency and duration of intervention. Total direct therapy dose has varied from 36 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] to 70 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], delivered in varying intensity from three week blocks (intensive model) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] to 34.6&#x000a0;weeks (distributed model) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Individual session duration has ranged from 45 to 180 minutes with a frequency of two to five sessions per week. Indirect treatment dose achieved via home programme is difficult to interpret due to inadequate reporting. Despite insufficient evidence to confirm optimal group format, several studies found that group-based therapy can achieve equal or greater improvement in outcomes across ICF domains when compared to individual standard care. These include improvements in gross motor ability (GMFM-66) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], crouch gait (3DGA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>], participation (Children&#x02019;s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment: CAPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>], health-related quality of life (TACQOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>] and goal attainment (GAS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. One RCT (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;51) compared group-based progressive resistance exercise strength training to individualised standard care in 51 ambulant children with CP (GMFCS I-III; mean age 10y 5mo, SD 1y 10mo; 29 male) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. This study reported no improvement in either group for gross motor ability (GMFM-66), walking ability (One Minute Fast Walk Test) or participation (CAPE). No studies have reported inferior outcomes for group-based interventions compared to individual standard care. Additional qualitative benefits of a group-based model have been reported in the context of the self-determination theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>]. A group program may enhance self-regulation and engagement in the therapy process by attending to children&#x02019;s basic psychological needs for Autonomy, Relatedness and Competence. There is potential for greater promotion of autonomy by allowing choice (personal goal setting), and through enjoyment, having fun and behaviour modelling to master activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. A sense of competence may be fulfilled through scaffolding activities to promote skill development, and providing opportunities for peer learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>] and healthy competition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>]. Social support and working with children with similar needs may also increase the feeling of relatedness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B55">55</xref>].</p><p>A group model has the potential to meet the physiotherapy rehabilitation needs for children post lower limb BoNT-A injections. To date there has been no study that has directly compared dose and content-matched group versus individual models of functional, goal-directed physiotherapy rehabilitation following lower limb BoNT-A injections for ambulant children with CP.

To our knowledge, this will be the first study to compare these two physiotherapy models with this population using outcome measures across domains of the ICF. It will address the essential need for rehabilitation services to consider flexible models of service delivery in response to family preferences and an increasing emphasis on improving goal-directed functional activity performance and societal participation within a family-centred framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B94">94</xref>]. Importantly, children, caregiver/s and therapists will have a greater informed choice of post BoNT-A rehabilitation delivery options.</p><sec><title>Ethics</title><p>The research ethics boards at the Royal Children&#x02019;s Hospital, Brisbane, Australia (HREC2008/089) and the Cerebral Palsy League, Brisbane, Australia (CPLQ2009/2010-1030) have granted approval for the study.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>RT: Rachel Thomas; LJ: Leanne Johnston; RB: Roslyn Boyd; LS: Leanne Sakzewski; MK: Megan Kentish; T1: Assessment Time 1 (baseline); T2: Assessment Time 2 (10&#x000a0;weeks post BoNT-A injections, efficacy); T3: Assessment Time 3 (26&#x000a0;weeks post BoNT-A injections, retention); CP: Cerebral palsy; BoNT-A: Botulinum Toxin- Type A; GMFCS-E&#x00026;R: Gross Motor Function Classification System- Expanded and Revised; ICF: International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health; RCT: Randomised controlled trial; GMFM-88: Gross Motor Function Measure-88; EVGS: Edinburgh Visual Gait Score for Cerebral Palsy; 3DGA: Three dimensional gait analysis; COPM: Canadian Occupational Performance Measure; GAS: Goal Attainment Scale; NDT: Neurodevelopmental therapy; CPT: Conventional physiotherapy; CAPE: Children&#x02019;s Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment; CP Health: Queensland Cerebral Palsy Health Service, Brisbane, Queensland; HEP: Home Exercise Programme; FMS: Functional Mobility Scale; QCGL: Queensland Children&#x02019;s Gait Laboratory; PRT: Pediatric Reach Test; ICC: Intraclass correlation coefficient; 1MFWT: One Minute Fast Walk Test; SEM: Standard error of measurement; CI: Confidence Interval; CPQOL-Child: Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire for Children; CPQOL-Teen: Cerebral Palsy Quality of Life Questionnaire for adolescents; QOL: Quality of Life; SLS: Single leg stance.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>RT, MK and LJ were responsible for the study concept, design and ethics applications.
