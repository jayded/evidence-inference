Baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, including mean lesion length (9.15&#x000b1;5.85 and 8.89&#x000b1;6.01 cm for the DCB and PTA groups, respectively). The primary effectiveness outcome was primary patency at 12 months, defined as freedom from clinically-driven target lesion revascularization (CD-TLR) and freedom from restenosis as determined by duplex ultrasonography. The safety endpoint was a composite of 30-day device- and procedure-related death and target limb major amputation and clinically-driven target vessel revascularization within 12 months. <bold>Results:</bold> Patients treated with DCBs exhibited superior 12-month primary patency (89%) compared to patients treated with PTA (48%, p&#x0003c;0.001). The 12-month CD-TLR rate was 3% for DCB vs 19% for PTA (p=0.012). There were no device- or procedure-related deaths, major amputations, or thromboses in either group. Quality-of-life measures showed sustained improvement from baseline to 12 months in both groups. <bold>Conclusion:</bold> Results from the MDT-2113 SFA Japan trial showed superior treatment effect for DCB vs PTA, with excellent patency and low CD-TLR rates. These results are consistent with other IN.PACT SFA DCB trials and demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of this DCB for the treatment of femoropopliteal lesions in this Japanese cohort.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>angioplasty</kwd><kwd>claudication</kwd><kwd>drug-coated balloon</kwd><kwd>femoropopliteal segment</kwd><kwd>paclitaxel</kwd><kwd>peripheral artery disease</kwd><kwd>popliteal artery</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>superficial femoral artery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1526602817745565"><title>Introduction</title><p>Treatment guidelines for femoropopliteal lesions have been updated significantly in the past decade because of improved outcomes associated with the use of novel endovascular devices, particularly nitinol stents.

Although these studies provide valuable insights into the benefits of DCB, the patients studied have been exclusively Caucasian, European, and American populations.

In terms of safety outcomes, no difference was observed between the groups in the incidence of death, limb amputation, or transition to surgical treatment within 30 days or at 12 months. The MDT-2113 SFA Japan trial was modeled after the randomized IN.PACT SFA trial in terms of design, DCB device evaluated, and outcomes assessed. At 12 months, Kaplan-Meier estimates in the IN.PACT SFA trial<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1526602817745565" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-1526602817745565" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> were 87.5% for patency rate and 2.4% for CD-TLR, which were quite similar to the 89% and 3% rates, respectively, from the present study.</p><p>There were important differences between the MDT-2113 SFA Japan cohort and patient groups from other similarly conducted studies. Japanese patients were on average older at the time of the procedure. The average age was 74 years in this cohort vs ~68 years in the IN.PACT SFA<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1526602817745565" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and LEVANT II<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1526602817745565" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> randomized trials but identical (73.5 years) to the Japanese study population in the Zilver PTX registry.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1526602817745565" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> The proportion of patients with diabetes was also higher [59% (DCB) and 56% (PTA)] in comparison with the 40% to 49% enrolled in other studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1526602817745565" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-1526602817745565" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> The present trial planned to enroll patients with lesions of up to 20 cm in length. The 9-cm mean lesion length for the DCB arm was similar to lengths in the IN.PACT SFA DCB group (9 cm) but longer than lesions in the LEVANT II (6 cm) and Zilver PTX DES (7 cm)<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1526602817745565" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> trials. Despite longer lesions and a sicker patient population in this study, outcomes were still favorable for DCB, while those treated with PTA were relatively poor.</p><p>In our trial, the provisional stent rate was very low despite the presence of longer lesions. Possible explanations for this low rate include optimal PTA technique, the use of IVUS, and exclusion of severe calcification per the study protocol, which likely limited the occurrence of severe dissections that may require stent use. In general, procedures for achieving optimal PTA at medical centers have changed in recent years. For one, the use of prolonged balloon inflations may have contributed to the low provisional stent rate we observed. Also, in recent years, IVUS has been incorporated in many institutions in Japan for endovascular procedures. IVUS was not mandated by the study protocol; its use was at the discretion of the implanting physician and per institutional practice. In the present study IVUS was used in 40% of DCB vs 25% of PTA patients, which allowed detailed assessment of vessel diameter and morphology, possibly leading to treatment without an excessive pressure load. Importantly, there was a trend toward improved outcomes in patients whose vessels were evaluated with IVUS before the procedure. Despite smaller numbers, there were marked differences in the PTA group with 12-month patency rates of 71% vs 42% for IVUS use vs no IVUS use, respectively. Additional studies are needed to provide insights regarding this observation.</p><p>While the MDT-2113 DCB was shown to be superior to PTA in this trial, it is important to note that these results may not be generalizable to other DCBs. Each DCB is unique in terms of the paclitaxel dose (2.0&#x02013;3.5 &#x000b5;g/mm<sup>2</sup>) on the balloon, the excipient, and the coating process employed to get the drug on the balloon. Each feature has the potential to influence the dose of paclitaxel delivered to the vessel wall and thus the effectiveness of the treatment. Each technology must be evaluated critically and stand on its own merit.</p><sec id="section17-1526602817745565"><title>Limitations</title><p>Although this randomized controlled trial was rigorously conducted with blinding and extensive oversight by core laboratories and a CEC, it enrolled only a limited number of patients.
