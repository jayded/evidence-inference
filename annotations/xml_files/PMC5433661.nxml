Both groups will be followed up for 6&#x02009;months to determine the effectiveness of the cessation interventions. The cost-effectiveness of the services will also be documented at the end of the study. The entire study will be completed in 24&#x02009;months, of which the final 6&#x02009;months will be reserved for study participant follow-up and quit rate evaluation.

These cessation services are more likely to be strengthened in a cost-effective manner when linked with existing primary health care system<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> especially in resource-constrained low and middle income country (LMIC) like India.</p><p>Tobacco cessation is the most important, cost-effective preventive maintenance that clinicians can offer study participants who use tobacco. It has been called the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; of prevention interventions by David Eddy, a leading authority on guidelines and cost-effectiveness analysis.<sup><xref rid="bibr9-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Primary care physicians play a key role in identification, assessment and treatment of tobacco users. Evidence shows that physician&#x02019;s message alone and counseling lead many patients to quit or significantly reduce their tobacco habit.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Effective tobacco interventions are available but underutilized because nicotine is widely used and culturally accepted. Physicians do not inquire about tobacco usage, do not use available interventions, are under time constraints and may not believe the effort of tobacco cessation intervention is worth the benefit to the study participant.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Recent data from Global Adult Tobacco Survey (GATS), India, show that less than half of smokers who visited health care providers were advised to stop smoking.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Published data from India suggest that physicians lack skills in delivering brief intervention and counseling in tobacco cessation.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> One of the reasons identified for such lack of preparedness by physicians is the fact that there are no well-established evidence-based certified tobacco cessation training programs in the country. A recent evaluation of the National Tobacco Control Programme (NTCP) in India reported an urgent need for training in tobacco cessation among the health care providers.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Findings from the Global Health Professionals Students Survey (GHPSS) showed a general lack of training on counseling techniques among dental, medical, nursing and pharmacy students.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> This training gap could be a major contributing factor to the low rates of tobacco cessation interventions delivered by physicians and highlights the urgent need for investments in both training physicians for delivering brief tobacco cessation interventions and creating a critical number of master trainers and resource networks for long-term sustainability. There are also limited data on the effectiveness of cessation interventions in Indian context.</p><p>We have designed a quasi-experimental study to evaluate the effectiveness of brief and intensive tobacco cessation interventions delivered by trained primary care providers in two states of India.</p></sec><sec id="section5-2050312117697173"><title>Study aim and objectives</title><p>The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of brief (3A)<sup><xref rid="bibr12-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> versus intensive (5A)<sup><xref rid="bibr16-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> tobacco cessation interventions in primary care practices of India.</p><p>The key objectives of this study are as follows:</p><list list-type="order" id="list1-2050312117697173"><list-item><p>To test the real-world effectiveness of physician-delivered 3A and 5A interventions;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To determine the abstinence rates in 3A and 5A intervention;</p></list-item><list-item><p>To compare the cost in implementing the 3A and 5A interventions.</p></list-item></list><p>In our study, we define 3A and 5A interventions as follows:</p><p>Brief intervention (3A)</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list2-2050312117697173"><list-item><p>Short counseling/interaction session (approximately 2&#x02013;3&#x02009;min), that is, 3As&#x02014;Ask, Advice &#x00026; Assess;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information, Education &#x00026; Communication (IEC) materials will be shown to the tobacco user.</p></list-item></list><p>Intensive intervention (5A)</p><list list-type="bullet" id="list3-2050312117697173"><list-item><p>Elaborate counseling session (approximately 5&#x02013;8&#x02009;min), that is, 5As&#x02014;Ask, Advice, Assess, Assist &#x00026; Arrange;</p></list-item><list-item><p>IEC materials will be used extensively during the counseling;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Study participant education materials/leaflets will be given to the tobacco users;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information on pharmacotherapy to quit tobacco;</p></list-item><list-item><p>Follow-up will be arranged.</p></list-item></list><sec id="section6-2050312117697173"><title>Theory of change</title><p>Due to the lack of skills among primary care physicians on cessation services, we designed a training model using both online and class teaching methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-2050312117697173">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1-2050312117697173" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Theory of change.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="10.1177_2050312117697173-fig1"/></fig><p>This was based on evidence-based tobacco cessation practices in a comprehensive manner and its importance in routine clinical practice drawn from models of behaviour change.

This could prove to be an effective low cost cessation model, ideal for government health care settings in India. Even a modest success rate could have a large effect on the availability and uptake of cessation services in health care. This will make a valuable contribution to lowering tobacco prevalence in the country.</p><p>Moreover, the results will provide information regarding the feasibility of implementing 5A and 3A services under routine conditions. This information is vital as NTCP of India has laid special emphasis on capacity building of physicians and other health care providers in tobacco cessation.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> From policy perspective, the study will provide the critical evidence to inform policy both at the state and the country levels. We reason that showcasing a well-developed cessation model will be the best advocacy tool and NTCP will itself be in a position to implement such models in all health care practices of India. All these activities will eventually strengthen the &#x0201c;National Tobacco Control Programme.&#x0201d;</p><p>Key findings from the formative research on establishing a tobacco control network in India validates the fact that there is an interest among different health care professionals in learning about cessation and integrating it in their clinical practices. This study will further help in informing and updating the existing resources in cessation. This will help in the building a structured tobacco dependence treatment services in the country based on both national and global evidence.</p><p>Generalizability of the study results may be limited because physicians and study participants willing to participate in a study on smoking cessation could be more interested and more engaged in smoking cessation activities compared to the general population. In addition, tobacco consumption will be measured via questionnaire, and consequently, study participants may over- or underreport the amount of tobacco consumed. However, measuring tobacco consumption via self-report measures is generally accurate and is most appropriate because the study design does not allow for biochemical validation. A possible source of bias is that will be recruited after primary care practices have been randomly allocated to the 3A or 5A group. In this case, the allocation schedule is known, which may lead to biased participant recruitment within medical practices.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050312117697173" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section24-2050312117697173"><title>Conclusion</title><p>It will be interesting to see the results of the study which to a great extent will reflect the real-world effectiveness of the interventions used in the Indian health settings.
