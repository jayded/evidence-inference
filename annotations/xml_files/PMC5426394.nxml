NE allows the visualization of the posterior and superior parts of the nasal airway, which cannot be seen by other means, e.g., anterior rhinoscopy. NE is usually accomplished with a rigid endoscope, but a flexible endoscope is preferred in patients with severe nasal septal deviation [<xref rid="b2-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. For the patients, NE is a painful and uncomfortable procedure [<xref rid="b3-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]; for the physicians, the disadvantages are prolonged procedure duration and limited view of nasal passages due to hypertrophic and swollen turbinates. In addition, some physiological changes such as acceleration of pulse rate and increase of blood pressure have been associated with NE [<xref rid="b4-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>As a preparation for NE, a local anesthetic and/or a decongestant are usually applied to nostrils in order to alleviate the nasal pain, to widen the field of view, and to shorten the duration of the examination. However, the benefits of local anesthetics are controversial, partly because they cause discomfort to patients because of the bad taste and smell [<xref rid="b5-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Furthermore, there is always a suspicion that local decongestants may cause hypertension and reflex bradycardia [<xref rid="b7-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Some authors recommend no medication before NE on the strength of placebo-controlled studies [<xref rid="b8-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="b11-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Other authors recommend only decongestant or decongestant&#x02013;local anesthetic combination applications [<xref rid="b12-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>-<xref rid="b14-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, there is no consensus about the best method of preparing the patients for NE [<xref rid="b1-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b3-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b10-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="b15-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>In this study, we aimed to identify the optimal pharmacological method of preparing the patients for NE while considering both the clinicians&#x02019; needs and the patients&#x02019; comfort and physiological stability.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective, randomized, double-blind study was approved by the local ethics committee. After obtaining informed consents, 20 healthy volunteers were enrolled. Exclusion criteria were asthma, cardiovascular disease, rhinitis, severe septal deviation, and a history of nasal endoscopic examination.</p><p>Four spray bottles of similar external appearance were prepared and numbered; two of the bottles contained normal saline (NS; 0.9% sodium chloride), one contained Iliadin (0.05% oxymetazoline; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), and one contained Xylocaine (10% lidocaine; AstraZeneca, S&#x000f6;dert&#x000e4;lje, Sweden). The nurse who prepared the bottles was the only person who was aware of the contents of the bottles.</p><p>Four binary combinations of sprays were applied in each subject&#x02019;s nostrils in a random order on four different days. In each day, two puffs (one puff per bottle; 0.1 mg oxymetazoline for Iliadin, 20 mg lidocaine for Xylocaine) were applied to both nostrils by the same clinical nurse. All four combinations were applied to each subject to reduce the bias of subjective evaluation and eliminate individual differences. The application and evaluation processes were identical for each combination (<xref rid="f1-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><sec><title>Spray combinations</title><p>The four binary combinations of sprays were as follows: placebo (NS+NS), decongestant (NS+oxymetazoline), anesthetic (NS+lidocaine), decongestant plus anesthetic (oxymetazoline+lidocaine).</p></sec><sec><title>Nasal endoscopy</title><p>All endoscopies were performed 10 minutes after medications by the same experienced physician who was blinded to the administered drugs using a 4.0-mm, 0-degree rigid endoscope (Karl STORZ GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Tuttlingen, Germany). In each endoscopy, choana, middle meatus, sphenoethmoidal recess, and superior concha were observed in both nasal passages. The nurse recorded the durations of the endoscopic examinations as seconds.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical evaluations</title><sec><title>Evaluation of discomfort due to the sprays</title><p>Shortly after spraying each bottle, subjects were asked to indicate their degree of discomfort on a visual analogue scale (VAS) (1: no discomfort, 10: utmost discomfort).

The same nurse did all the measurements. Blood pressure was measured with the same calibrated manometer and from the same arm of each subject. Mean blood pressures (MBP) in mmHg and change between the measurements for each application were recorded. Pulse rate was detected by palpating the radial artery, and recorded as beats per minute (BPM).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For statistical analyses, SigmaStat 3.5 (Systat Software, Inc.; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sigmaplot.co.uk/">http://www.sigmaplot.co.uk/</ext-link>) software was used. A Shapiro-Wilk test was used to test the normality of data distribution. Normally distributed data are presented as means&#x000b1;standard deviation (SD). An analysis of variance test was used for repeated measures. Pairwise comparisons were performed by using the post-hoc parametric Student-Newman-Keuls method. The data, which was not normally distributed, are presented as medians (range), and a Friedman test was used for their analysis. Pairwise comparisons were performed by the nonparametric Student-Newman-Keuls method.

We confirmed that lidocaine spray is very uncomfortable for patients. Besides, it does not reduce pain during endoscopy, and it narrows the field of view in nasal passages and prolongs the duration of endoscopy. According to our results, oxymetazoline is comfortable for patients. It reduces pain during endoscopy and provides a wide field of view for the endoscopist. However, it causes a slight increase in arterial blood pressure. When oxymetazoline and lidocaine are used together, pain due to endoscopy is reduced significantly, the endoscopist&#x02019;s field of view is wide, and the duration of endoscopy is shortened.</p><p>Premedication in NE is typically applied with sprays or cotton pledgets. Although application of cotton pledgets is an effective method, it is irritating for patients [<xref rid="b17-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, sprays are used more often, and we preferred sprays to cotton pledgets in this study.</p><p>It is well known that lidocaine sprays have bad taste and smell, and that they anesthetize not only the nose but also the palate, nasopharynx, and throat. These features make lidocaine sprays uncomfortable for the patients [<xref rid="b5-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. On the other hand, decongestant sprays do not have these unfavorable effects [<xref rid="b11-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Indeed, in this study, no differences were observed between oxymetazoline and placebo in terms of discomfort.</p><p>Interestingly, even though lidocaine is an anesthetic, it does not reduce pain during endoscopy [<xref rid="b5-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b19-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In this study, we showed that pain scores were similar between lidocaine and placebo. In our opinion, the most important reason of pain during endoscopy with lidocaine is the congestion of turbinates. We reached this opinion with the evaluation of the physician&#x02019;s field of view. The field of view with lidocaine was narrower than with placebo. Moreover, while nasal decongestion was best achieved with oxymetazoline, the field of view decreased when oxymetazoline was used in combination with lidocaine. On the other hand, the best pain score was attained by lidocaine plus oxymetazoline. Therefore, the combined use of decongestant and lidocaine decreased pain compared to decongestant only. Therefore, the anesthetic effect of lidocaine could be obtained when turbinates are decongested.</p><p>Some physicians avoid using premedication for NE because of its systemic effects. Even though clinicians suppose that topical decongestants cause hypertension and reflex bradycardia, there are not many studies supporting this [<xref rid="b7-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Similarly, NE may also increase pulse rate and arterial blood pressure [<xref rid="b4-ceo-2016-00563" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. However, as clinicians, we use decongestant sprays and perform endoscopies relatively often, but do not observe these changes as often as supposed. In this study, we showed that oxymetazoline slightly increased MBP 10 minutes after its application, but MBP returned to its initial level immediately after endoscopy. Interestingly, this effect of oxymetazoline was not seen when it was combined with lidocaine. We also showed that the pulse rate did not change significantly with any of the sprays used in this study. Furthermore, the changes of pulse rate and blood pressure due to the sprays and endoscopy were not clinically relevant. However, this finding may be a result of the exclusion of elders and patients with cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, we recommend using decongestants carefully in elderly patients and in patients with cardiovascular diseases. Nonetheless, these sprays can be used safely in young and healthy individuals.</p><p>The duration of endoscopic examination can also be an issue for physicians. In this regard, we evaluated the duration of endoscopy in order to consider the demands of physicians as well as of patients. This has not been considered in any of the similar studies so far. Our findings showed that the shortest duration of examination as well as the minimum pain score were provided by the decongestant&#x02013;anesthetic combination. On the other hand, the best decongestion was obtained with decongestant alone. Standing on these observations, we suggest that duration of endoscopy is not only related to the wide passage in the nose but also strongly related to the patient&#x02019;s feeling of nasal pain.</p><p>In conclusion, the combined use of a decongestant and an anesthetic spray provided better field of view, reduced pain significantly, and decreased the duration of endoscopy. For these reasons, we considered decongestant plus anesthetic the best premedication method for nasal endoscopy. Because anesthetic sprays have bad taste and smell, we recommend using a decongestant spray alone in patients who refuse to use an anesthetic spray, while considering its side effects.</p></sec><sec><title>HIGHLIGHTS</title><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><p>&#x025aa; Lidocaine discomforted the patients more than placebo.</p><p>&#x025aa; Oxymetazoline caused the best and lidocaine caused the worst decongestion score.</p><p>&#x025aa; The lowest pain score related to endoscopy was obtained for oxymetazoline plus lidocaine.</p><p>&#x025aa; Decongestant plus anesthetic spray seems to be the best premedication in nasal endoscopy.</p></boxed-text></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>No potential conflict of interest relevant to this article was reported.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>We thank G&#x000fc;lhan &#x0015e;im&#x0015f;ek, the nurse of outpatient otolaryngology clinic of Erciyes University Medical School, for helping us collecting the data.
