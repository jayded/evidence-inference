Missed sessions, often associated with communication barriers, can result in emergency dialysis and avoidable hospitalizations. This proof of concept study explored using a novel digital-messaging platform, EpxDialysis, to improve patient-to-dialysis center communication via widely available text messaging and telephone technology. A randomized controlled trial was conducted through Washington University-affiliated hemodialysis centers involving ESRD patients with poor attendance, defined as missing 2&#x02013;6 sessions over the preceding 12 weeks. A cross-over study design evaluated appointment adherence between intervention and control groups. Comparing nonadherence rates eight weeks prior to enrollment, median appointment adherence after using the system increased by 75%, and median number of unintended hospitalization days fell by 31%. A conservative cost-benefit analysis of EpxDialysis demonstrates a 1:36 savings ratio from appointment adherence. EpxDialysis is a low-risk, cost-effective, intervention for increasing hemodialysis adherence in high-risk patients, especially at centers caring for vulnerable and low-income patients.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a major health issue, with more than 660,000 patients being treated for ESRD in the United States, according to the latest U.S. Renal Data Systems Annual Data Report<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Among those patients, 468,000 receive chronic hemodialysis (HD) therapy.

In a study involving 54 dialysis units, 5&#x02013;7% of patients missed at least one treatment session within a 4-week window<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. Over 12-week follow-up, one half of patients had missed or shortened treatments. Hemodialysis nonadherence has consequences such as bone demineralization, pulmonary congestion and electrolyte disturbances<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Missing &#x0003e;1 HD appointment per month is associated with a 30% increase in mortality, though the exact mechanisms of this increase are unclear<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup>.

Given these needs and constraints, automated electronic communication using ubiquitous forms of technology (e.g. landline phone, cell phone and text message) may be a cost effective and easily implemented solution for hemodialysis non-adherence.</p><p id="Par6">The proof-of-concept study was conducted in the Chromalloy American Kidney Center (CAKC), located within Washington University School of Medicine at Barnes-Jewish Hospital, and its affiliated Forest Park Dialysis Unit, in close proximity to CAKC. CAKC treats approximately 200 patients, while the Forest Park unit serves 138 patients. Both dialysis centers are staffed by faculty from the Washington University Renal Division. The dialysis units serve a predominantly low-income, minority population from economically disadvantaged neighborhoods contiguous to the medical school. Approximately 65% of the patients are African American, and 25% of the clients receive Medicaid at the inception of their dialysis treatments. The demographic makeup and adverse payer mix of the dialysis units are distinct from the surrounding affluent, mostly White townships, so the results of this study may not be generalizable to suburban dialysis units or units not affiliated with a teaching hospital.</p><p id="Par7">The dialysis centers have structured their operations to accommodate a clientele that has low health literacy, limited English proficiency, and social factors such as lack of access to transportation that could affect adherence to dialysis treatments. The units reserve an open chair on its second and third shift to accommodate patients identified through the Epharmix intervention. The units also operate an emergency fund that covers taxi vouchers and other unexpected patient expenses.</p><p id="Par8">After discussions with local dialysis centers and patients, we created a proactive short message service (SMS) and voice-messaging system, building on work done previously in telemedicine, that automatically notifies patients of upcoming dialysis sessions, provides messaging that emphasize partnership between the patient and the dialysis center, and offers a support line if any urgent issues come requiring modification or rescheduling of their session. SMS technology is commonly used to send mobile to mobile text messages in the United States and internationally. This system, hereafter referred to as &#x0201c;EpxDialysis,&#x0201d; was created under the auspices of IDEA Labs, a student-run design incubator at Washington University. In this proof of concept study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of utilizing the disease and population specific automated messaging system, EpxDialysis, among chronic hemodialysis patients and determining the effect of this intervention on (1) patient attendance to scheduled HD treatments, (2) subsequent patient hospitalizations and (3) cost and benefits associated with its use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p id="Par9">This prospective randomized controlled study was approved by the Washington University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.

</p><p id="Par15">HD Attendance: Through interviews with ESRD patients on hemodialysis, we determined the most common reasons for missing dialysis patients were related to symptoms of illness, lack of childcare resources and lack of transportation. Although dialysis centers may have resources including social workers and taxi vouchers, patients were often not aware of their availability. Furthermore, these dialysis patients rarely reported to the dialysis center ahead of time to notify staff of an upcoming absence, leading to waste of the medical supplies prepared for their treatment sessions. Lack of communication with the dialysis center also prevented the patients from promptly rescheduling their session to the following day or coming in for at least an abbreviated session and thereby maintaining the treatment goals or preventing unnecessary emergency dialysis sessions. In rare cases, patients unfamiliar with the symptoms of systemic fluid overload would skip sessions due to illness, without realizing that hemodialysis would relieve some of the symptoms. The inadequate two-way communication seemed to be associated with health detriments to patients and inefficient delivery of care. Prior to the use of EpxDialysis, the clinic had tried follow-up after patients missed sessions, puppet shows, and educational videos on the importance of coming to dialysis appointments. However, on interview patients reported that absences were often unplanned with extenuating circumstances as described above, and the normal flyers with the phone numbers to call for help often could not be found.</p><p id="Par16">With EpxDialysis, the baseline median number of missed sessions in the twelve weeks preceding the intervention was 4.5 (SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.73) for group A and 4.0 (SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.67) for group B. After 8 weeks of study protocol, group A (receiving the EpxDialysis) missed a median of 1.5 (SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.61) sessions compared to 4.0 (SE&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.13) for group B (control).

Missed appointments by treatment group and month are outlined in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>. The pooled median number of missed sessions was 1.0 for all patients receiving the messaging intervention and 4.0 for those receiving standard of care without messaging intervention.

Previous studies have shown that outcomes of ESRD are dependent on duration and regularity of hemodialysis; missing or shortening one or more dialysis sessions per month leads to increased emergency department visits and hospital admissions for emergent dialysis and acute management of ESRD-related complications, and is associated with a 30% increase in mortality<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref></sup>. According to USRDS data<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, hemodialysis treatments cost Medicare on average $86,496 per patient per year. When sessions are missed without prior notification, the medical equipment and time of staff spent on preparing machines wasted. Due to the limited number of dialysis machines at each dialysis unit, utilization of the machines is decreased while other patients may be going without treatment. Of note, in the application of this trial, there was no change in staffing. As such, when patients called to reschedule or change their time, the absolute time dialyzed may have been reduced, but they were still able to get into the schedule with shorter wait times.</p><p id="Par22">It is well known that improving adherence among hemodialysis patients is a challenging issue. Our intervention, EpxDialysis, was associated with a decrease in missed treatment sessions. Due to the cross-over design of the study, we were able to evaluate both the effects during the intervention period and after withdrawing the intervention. The pooled average number of missed appointments was 1 for patients receiving the intervention, compared to 4 for patients without intervention, representing a 75% change in attendance. A 62.5% rebound in number of appointments missed by Group A was observed when the intervention was terminated. We attribute the results observed to three components incorporated in the intervention&#x02019;s design. The proactive nature of the intervention reminded patients of their upcoming session and provided guidance for clinically-concerning symptoms, such as nausea, vomiting or diarrhea. The hotline call system also prompted patients to reschedule appointments that they were unable to attend, routing any calls directly to the appropriate dialysis center. Finally, the messages, designed to include friendly greetings and communicate information at a 4th grade level, may have the additional benefit of encouraging patients to feel engaged in their care and connected to their healthcare providers.</p><p id="Par23">This study demonstrated positive trends toward improved adherence with use of the intervention, however, the size of this sample represents the main limitation to this study. Due to small sample size, results could not reach statistical significance for the variables of interest. In addition, we observed high variability of results in individual patients; these stochastic effects would likely be minimized in a larger study. Another limitation is that our study was conducted from March through June, and improvements in weather allowing more accessible transport, may have contributed to higher dialysis attendance rates. However, the rebound in missed sessions observed among Group A patients during the second study period suggests that weather did not fully confound the intervention&#x02019;s effect. The earlier increased effect of the system during colder months may be due to cold weather, flu season, plus the traditional difficulties with transport caused more preventable missed dialysis sessions that EpxDialysis was able to resolve. Additionally, it is possible that the staff at the dialysis centers were particularly receptive, interested, and motivated to implement systems such as ours and that staff in other settings might be less so. Though we did not measure biochemical parameters such as Kt/V and serum phosphorous that are related to adequacy of dialysis, future studies would benefit from measuring such biochemical parameters. Despite these limitations, this preliminary study indicates that EpxDialysis has the benefits of easy implementation among ESRD patients with minimal labor costs for health care facilities. Further studies featuring EpxDialysis on a larger scale are needed to investigate not only changes in patient behavior, as well as clinical outcomes, including ED admissions, hospitalizations, and death. More robust data may facilitate the improved design of EpxDialysis and offer lasting solutions for chronic hemodialysis patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par24">We were able to demonstrate the feasibility of implementing EpxDialysis within the chronic hemodialysis population. The trends suggest that the intervention has potential to improve adherence with medically-prescribed dialysis treatment. Though our study population was too small to undergo statistical analysis and determine statistical significance, this was an effective pilot study. These results merit future investigation of the mid and long term of effects of EpxDialysis for hemodialysis, as well as clinical outcomes associated with improved adherence. EpxDialysis is an inexpensive, low risk, non-invasive intervention that can be implemented to help high risk patients. Given the high cost-benefit ratio of 1:36, we think EpxDialysis could be a pragmatic and effective tool to improve hemodialysis appointment adherence.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>A.
