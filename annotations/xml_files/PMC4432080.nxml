Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is defined by impairments in communication, social interaction and by restricted and repetitive behaviours (American Psychiatric Association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2000</xref>). There is increasing evidence for comorbidity between disorders (Rommelse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2011</xref>; Simonoff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">2008</xref>; van der Meer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">2012</xref>) and shared executive function deficits (Corbett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Geurts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>), in particular in motor response inhibition (Alderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Corbett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Lipsyzc and Schachar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2009</xref>), albeit less consistently in ASD (Ozonoff and Strayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">1997</xref>; Raymaekers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2007</xref>). Furthermore, this has been associated with impulsiveness in ADHD and motor stereotypies in ASD (Langen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2011</xref>). This overlap was highlighted by recent changes to the DSM-V that allows co-diagnosis of ADHD and ASD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dsm5.org/">http://www.dsm5.org/</ext-link>).</p><p>In ADHD, there is consistent evidence of underactivation compared to controls in inferior/orbitofrontal frontal cortex (IFC/OFC), supplementary motor area (SMA) and caudate/thalamus during inhibition tasks (Cubillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Rubia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1999</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2005b</xref>; Cortese et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>; Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>). In children with ASD, however, no study has investigated the neurofunctional underpinnings of response inhibition. In adults with ASD, fMRI studies report inconsistent findings of increased activation in left IFC and decreased activation in right IFC and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) during the go/no-go task (Kana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2007</xref>; Schmitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2006</xref>). Therefore, a key question is whether the underlying neurobiology of shared cognitive phenotypes is shared or disorder-specific.</p><p>Serotonin (SE) is involved in impulsiveness and motor inhibition (Robbins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2010</xref>) and although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as citalopram had no effect on SSRT in healthy subjects (Chamberlain et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2006</xref>), fMRI studies showed that SSRIs and acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), which enhance/reduce SE levels, enhance/decrease inhibitory IFC/OFC-striatal activation, respectively (Lamar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>; Lamar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2005a</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, there is evidence that 5-HT is involved in the pathology of both ADHD and ASD. Thus, polymorphisms of serotonergic genes have been associated with both ADHD and ASD (Rommelse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2010</xref>; Sinzig and Lehmkuhl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2007</xref>). Moreover, biochemical serotonergic abnormalities have been implicated in both ADHD (Oades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>) and ASD (Zafeiriou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2009</xref>). Despite evidence for SE abnormalities in both disorders, few studies have investigated the clinical efficacy of SSRIs in ADHD and ASD. The SSRI fluoxetine, for example, has been shown to improve inattentiveness and hyperactivity in comorbid children with ADHD (Barrickman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1991</xref>; Gammon and Brown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">1993</xref>; Quintana et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2007</xref>) and to improve communication, social interaction and stereotyped behaviours in children with ASD (DeLong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>; DeLong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">1998</xref>; Hollander et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">2005</xref>), albeit citalopram was not effective (King et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>).</p><p>Given the evidence for abnormalities in SE (Oades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">2007</xref>; Zafeiriou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">2009</xref>) and inhibition in both disorders (Alderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2007</xref>; Corbett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Geurts et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2004</xref>; Robinson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">2009</xref>; Rommelse et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2011</xref>) and serotonergic mediation of inhibitory control (Anderson et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2008</xref>; Lamar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>; Lamar et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">2009</xref>; Robbins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2010</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2005a</xref>), an important question that may elucidate the&#x000a0;potential neurotransmitter underpinnings of these&#x000a0;cognitive abnormalities is whether SE modulates the inhibitory network in <italic>both</italic> ADHD and ASD and whether this modulation differs between disorders.</p><p>The aim of this fMRI study was therefore to investigate (1) shared and disorder-specific brain dysfunctions in ADHD and ASD boys during a tracking stop task and (2) shared and disorder-specific neurofunctional effects of an acute dose of fluoxetine on these inhibitory (dys)functions in both disorders. It has been argued that inferior frontal activation during stop task performance may be confounded by the attentional oddball effect of the low frequency appearance of stop signals (Hampshire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; Pauls et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2012a</xref>). Given that in this study we were particularly interested in the effects of fluoxetine on inhibitory rather than on attention networks, in our fMRI analysis&#x000a0;we contrasted successful stop trials with failed stop trials in order to control for the attentional oddball effect of the low frequency appearance of the stop trials.</p><p>We hypothesised that, under placebo, ADHD boys compared to controls would show decreased IFC and caudate activation (Cortese et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2012</xref>; Cubillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Cubillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>; Rubia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1999</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2005b</xref>), whereas ASD boys would show increased left frontal activation (Schmitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2006</xref>). We further hypothesised that fluoxetine compared to placebo, given its beneficial effects on symptoms, would normalise the abnormal activations in each disorder, i.e. it would increase the reduced fronto-striatal activation in ADHD, but reduce the increased left frontal abnormalities in ASD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Sixty-two right-handed boys (Edinburgh Handedness Inventory) (Oldfield <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">1971</xref>) (25 controls, 18 with ADHD and 19 with ASD) aged 10&#x02013;17, IQ&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;70 (Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence-Revised (WASI-R) (Wechsler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">1999</xref>) participated in this study.</p><p>ADHD boys had a clinical diagnosis of non-comorbid ADHD, inattentive/hyperactive-impulsive combined subtype, as assessed by an experienced child psychiatrist using the standardised Maudsley diagnostic interview that assesses ADHD according to DSM-IV criteria (Goldberg and Murray <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2006</xref>). They scored above clinical threshold for ADHD symptoms on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ) (Goodman and Scott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1999</xref>) and the Conners&#x02019; Parent Rating Scale-Revised (CPRS-R) (Conners et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1998</xref>). Four of the ADHD boys were medication-na&#x000ef;ve, three had ceased taking methylphenidate for a year (1), or 3&#x000a0;months (2) and 11 received chronic stimulants, but had a 48-h medication washout prior to scanning. ADHD boys were excluded if they scored above 15 on the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) (Rutter et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">2003</xref>).</p><p>ASD diagnosis was made using ICD-10 (World Health Organisation (WHO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">1994</xref>) diagnostic criteria and confirmed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI&#x02013;R) (Lord et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1994</xref>) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) (Lord et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2000</xref>). All ASD subjects were medication-na&#x000ef;ve apart from one patient, who took melatonin (but underwent a 2-week medication washout). ASD exclusion criteria included a score above 7 on the hyperactivity/inattention subscale of the SDQ or a <italic>t</italic> score above 70 on the DSM-IV subscale of the CPRS-R.</p><p>Exclusion criteria for all were comorbidity with other psychiatric or neurological disorders and drug/alcohol dependency. Patients were recruited from local clinics and support groups.</p><p>Patients were scanned twice in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled design, using a Latin square randomization design for counter-balanced effects. Due to the half-life of fluoxetine (1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;days) and its metabolite norfluoxetine (5&#x02013;16&#x000a0;days) (Wong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1995</xref>), each scan was 3&#x02013;4&#x000a0;weeks apart. To ensure that fluoxetine had reached its peak plasma levels, after 5&#x02013;8&#x000a0;h (Wong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">1995</xref>), patients were scanned 5&#x000a0;h after administration. Liquid fluoxetine was titrated to age and weight (see supplement). Placebo was equivalent amounts of peppermint water with similar taste to fluoxetine.</p><p>Twenty-five healthy, handedness and age-matched boys were recruited by advertisement and scored below clinical thresholds on the SDQ, SCQ and CPRS.</p><p>Participants gave written informed consent/assent.

A whole-brain high-resolution structural scan (inversion recovery gradient echo planar image) on which to superimpose the individual activation maps, was also acquired in the inter-commissural plane with TE&#x02009;=&#x02009;30&#x000a0;ms, TR&#x02009;=&#x02009;3&#x000a0;s, flip angle&#x02009;=&#x02009;90&#x000b0;, 43 slices, slice thickness&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.0&#x000a0;mm, slice skip&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3&#x000a0;mm and in-plane voxel-size&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.875&#x000a0;mm.</p><p>All subjects performed three other fMRI tasks which are not reported here.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>FMRI image analysis</title><p>The XBAM software package was used (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.brainmap.co.uk/">http://www.brainmap.co.uk/</ext-link>) (Brammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1997</xref>) which makes no normality assumptions (often violated in fMRI data), but instead uses median statistics to control outlier effects and permutation rather than normal theory-based inference (Thirion et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2007</xref>).</p><p>Individual- and group-level analyses are described in further detail elsewhere (Brammer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">1997</xref>; Cubillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2003</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2005b</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2007</xref>) and in the supplementary material. Briefly, the fMRI data were realigned to minimise motion-related artefacts and smoothed using a Gaussian filter (FWHM 8.82&#x000a0;mm) (Bullmore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">1999a</xref>). Further data analysis included slice timing correction and the residual effects of motion were regressed out from the time series (using the estimated motion parameters) before fitting a general linear model. Time-series analysis of individual subject activation was performed with a wavelet-based resampling method previously described (Bullmore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>). We convolved the task epoch of the contrasts of interest (i.e. successful stop&#x02014;implicit go trials; failed stop trials&#x02014;implicit go trials) and the higher level contrast (successful stop-go trials minus unsuccessful stop-go trials) with two Poisson model functions (delays of 4 and 8&#x000a0;s). Individual activation maps were recalculated by testing the goodness-of-fit of this convolution with the BOLD time series; the goodness-of-fit calculation used the ratio of the sum of squares of deviations from the mean intensity value due to the model (fitted time series) divided by the sum of squares due to the residuals (original time series minus model time series). This statistic, the sum of squares (SSQ) ratio, was used in further analyses. Using rigid body and affine transformation, the individual maps were registered into Talairach standard space. A group brain activation map was then produced for each medication condition and each experimental condition (see supplementary material).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>ANCOVA between-group difference analyses</title><p>For between-group comparisons between controls and patients under either placebo or fluoxetine, one-way ANCOVA analyses with group as factor and rotational and translation movement in Euclidian 3-D space as covariate, were conducted using randomization-based tests for voxel or cluster-wise differences as described in detail elsewhere (Bullmore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2001</xref>; Bullmore et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1999b</xref>).

Relative to controls, ADHD patients showed reduced left OFC/basal ganglia activation, whereas ASD patients showed enhanced bilateral ventrolateral prefrontal activation relative to ADHD and controls. Fluoxetine normalized these disorder-dissociated brain abnormalities relative to controls, via disorder-dissociated opposite effects within patients: fluoxetine enhanced the abnormally reduced OFC/basal ganglia activation in ADHD, but reduced it in ASD. In contrast, it reduced the abnormally enhanced IFC activation in ASD, but enhanced it in ADHD. However, rigorous testing for the significance of these normalisation effects showed that these were only significant for the abnormality clusters in ASD. Furthermore, fluoxetine also had opposite disorder-dissociated effects on other inhibition areas such as pre-SMA and cerebellum: these were, respectively, enhanced (SMA) and reduced (cerebellum) in ADHD with fluoxetine relative to placebo, but reduced (SMA) and enhanced (cerebellum) in ASD.</p><p>The finding of disorder-specific increased activation in ASD relative to controls and ADHD in the left and right (trend-wise significant relative to ADHD) IFC extends our previous finding of increased left IFC activation in young adults with Asperger's syndrome during a go/no-go task (Schmitz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2006</xref>) by demonstrating disorder-specificity relative to ADHD. Predominantly, the right (Chambers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2003</xref>) but also left IFC (Hampshire et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2010</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2011</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2001</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2007</xref>) are crucial areas mediating response inhibition and ASD patients may have needed to recruit these areas more for comparable task performance. ADHD patients had no underactivation in these areas relative to controls, unlike observed previously (Cubillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>; Rubia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1999</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2005b</xref>), but relative to ASD. This, and the lack of a significant difference between controls and ADHD boys in SSRT may be due to long-term effects of stimulant medication, which has been associated with more normal prefrontal and striatal function (Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2012</xref>; Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>), as 11 of the ADHD boys were on chronic methylphenidate medication, even if taken off medication prior to the scan. It is also interesting to note that the enhanced omission errors which were observed in ADHD patients relative to both control and ASD boys under placebo were correlated with reduced IFC-striatal activation under placebo. It has been suggested that omission errors are indicative of an alternative strategy that ADHD boys may employ to decrease their number of failed inhibitions (Tannock et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1989</xref>). Therefore, although there was no behavioural evidence for poor inhibitory performance using the inhibitory measure of the SSRT, there were significant behavioural differences in omission errors in ADHD patients under placebo. The differences correlated with the neurofunctional deficits and were no longer observed under fluoxetine. The disorder-exclusive deficits in ADHD adolescents in the left OFC/basal ganglia relative to controls extend prior findings of OFC-striatal deficits in ADHD (Cubillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Hart et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2013</xref>; Rubia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">2011</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1999</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2005b</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2014</xref>). Our results therefore show disorder-dissociated frontal lobe dysfunctions in ADHD and ASD boys during inhibition relative to controls: with ASD patients showing significantly enhanced bilateral IFC activation and ADHD boys showing significantly reduced OFC/basal ganglia activation, which furthermore correlated with their enhanced omission errors during task performance.</p><p>Fluoxetine normalized all disorder-dissociated frontal brain dysfunctions due to opposite modulation effects in both disorders, which were, however, only significant in the ASD group. Fluoxetine significantly reduced bilateral OFC activation in the ASD group but enhanced it in ADHD. Under fluoxetine, ADHD patients also no longer showed enhanced omission errors, which were reduced under placebo and correlated with the OFC deficits. Fluoxetine also had an opposite up/downregulation effect on another key inhibition region, the pre-SMA: this was upregulated in ASD and hence increased relative to controls and ADHD, but downregulated in ADHD and hence reduced relative to controls and ASD. The upregulation effect of fluoxetine on right IFC and left OFC-striatal regions in ADHD extends prior evidence on SE agonist modulation of these areas in healthy adults during inhibitory control (Del-Ben et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2005</xref>) to the ADHD population. Most intriguing, however, are the consistently opposite reduction effects of fluoxetine on these frontal activations in the ASD group. Opposite activation effects could possibly reflect group differences in baseline SE levels, as evidenced by lower platelet SE levels in ADHD children compared to controls (Spivak et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1999</xref>), and increased baseline platelet, blood and prefrontal SE levels in 30&#x000a0;% of individuals with ASD relative to controls (Hranilovic et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2007</xref>; Mulder et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2004</xref>; Nakamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>; Piven et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1991</xref>). In addition, ASD patients have abnormal 5-HT synthesis (Chugani et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">1997</xref>), 5-HT transporter (Makkonen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008</xref>; Nakamura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2010</xref>) and 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor binding (Murphy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2006</xref>). Therefore, fluoxetine may increase the low SE baseline of children with ADHD to normal levels, leading to normalized activation in fronto-striatal areas. Whereas in children with ASD, the increase in SE in an already hyperserotonemic system may activate a negative feedback mechanism via activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> autoreceptors (Sibley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR69">2007</xref>), leading to a decrease in SE and in fronto-striatal activation.</p><p>Despite significant modulation effects on brain activation, fluoxetine had no effect on inhibitory performance. However, the enhanced omission errors that were observed in ADHD patients under placebo relative to controls were no longer significant under fluoxetine. Furthermore, it is well documented that brain function is more sensitive to pharmacological manipulations than inhibitory performance (Cubillo et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2014</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2011</xref>; Rubia et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">2005a</xref>). In addition, one of the upregulated regions in ASD in a key inhibitory area, the pre-SMA, was correlated with SSRT, suggesting a relationship between activation changes and inhibitory performance.</p><p>The strengths of this study are carefully selected and non-comorbid patient groups who had no psychiatric comorbidities and, in the case of the ASD group, were medication-na&#x000ef;ve. A limitation of this study is that for ethical and financial reasons, the control group was scanned only once, while patients were scanned twice which could have accounted for the lack of performance differences. The significantly lower IQ in the ADHD compared to the other two groups is another limitation. However, covariance analysis showed that the findings were not affected by IQ. Furthermore, stop task performance has been shown to be independent of IQ (Friedman et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). Lastly, while the contrast of successful and unsuccessful stop trials controls for the attentional oddball effect of the low frequency of stop stimuli, it may be over-conservative, as during unsuccessful stop trials subjects may also attempt, but not achieve to inhibit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To summarise, ADHD and ASD patients showed opposite brain activation abnormalities relative to controls: ADHD boys showed reduced while ASD boys enhanced frontal activation. Importantly, fluoxetine had a disorder-dissociated opposite effect on frontal brain dysfunctions, enhancing frontal activation in ADHD and reducing it in ASD which could suggest differential underlying SE baseline levels in the two disorders.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec23"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="213_2014_3837_MOESM1_ESM.docx"><label>ESM 1</label><caption><p>(DOCX 214&#x000a0;kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study and Dr. Andy Simmonds were supported by the UK Department of Health via the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) for Mental Health at South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust and Institute of Psychiatry, King&#x02019;s College London.
