Current treatments are associated with high survival rates but often result in significant long-term toxicities. In particular, long-term dysphagia has a negative impact on patient quality of life and health. The aim of PATHOS is to determine whether reducing the intensity of adjuvant treatment after minimally invasive transoral surgery in this favourable prognosis disease will result in better long-term swallowing function whilst maintaining excellent disease-specific survival outcomes.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>The study is a multicentre phase II/III randomised controlled trial for patients with biopsy-proven Human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer staged T1-T3&#x000a0;N0-N2b with a primary tumour that is resectable via a transoral approach. Following transoral surgery and neck dissection, patients are allocated into three groups based on pathological risk factors for recurrence. Patients in the low-risk pathology group will receive no adjuvant treatment, as in standard practice. Patients in the intermediate-risk pathology group will be randomised to receive either standard dose post-operative radiotherapy (control) or reduced dose radiotherapy. Patients in the high-risk pathology group will be randomised to receive either post-operative chemoradiotherapy (control) or radiotherapy alone. The primary outcome of the phase II study is patient reported swallowing function measured using the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory score at 12&#x000a0;months post-treatment. If the phase II study is successful, PATHOS will proceed to a phase III non-inferiority trial with overall survival as the primary endpoint.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>PATHOS is a prospective, randomised trial for Human papillomavirus-positive oropharyngeal cancer, which represents a different disease entity compared with other head and neck cancers. The trial aims to demonstrate that long-term dysphagia can be lessened by reducing the intensity of adjuvant treatment without having a negative impact on clinical outcome. The study will standardise transoral surgery and post-operative intensity-modulated radiotherapy protocols in the UK and develop a gold-standard swallowing assessment panel. An associated planned translational research programme, underpinned by tumour specimens and sequential blood collected as part of PATHOS, will facilitate further empirical understanding of this new disease and its response to treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02215265">NCT02215265</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) is a rapidly increasing disease in the UK and other developed countries as a result of Human papillomavirus (HPV) genotype 16 infection. Currently, over 70&#x000a0;% of OPSCC in Europe is HPV 16 positive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. HPV status is a strong and independent prognostic factor for survival, and HPV-positive OPSCC has a 58&#x000a0;% reduction in the risk of death compared to HPV-negative OPSCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Other factors known to influence prognosis in HPV-positive OPSCC include smoking, particularly current smoking, nodal stage and patient comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Currently, the management of OPSCC is based on the stage of disease as well as clinician and patient preference, irrespective of HPV status. Early stage disease is treated with either surgery or radiotherapy (RT) alone, whilst locally advanced disease requires multimodality treatment with primary chemoradiotherapy (CRT) +/- neck dissection or primary surgical resection followed by post-operative RT/CRT. Severe late toxicities after multimodality treatment are reported in up to 43&#x000a0;% of patients and may be permanent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Patients and their carers report dysphagia to be a primary cause for distress, and patient reported dysphagia independently predicts for poor long-term quality of life (QOL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC tend to be young (mean age 54&#x000a0;years) and fit at presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Reducing the adverse impact of treatment on function and maintaining good QOL are therefore of paramount importance in these patients who have good prognosis disease.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Role of transoral surgery</title><p>With the advent of minimally invasive techniques, such as Transoral Laser Microsurgery (TLM) and Transoral Robotic Surgery (TORS), there has been renewed interest in primary surgical treatment for OPSCC as these techniques result in less morbidity when compared to open surgery. There are as yet no prospective randomised data on TLM/TORS for OPSCC but retrospective studies have demonstrated excellent outcomes. A US study of 204 patients with stage III-IV OPSCC treated with TLM and neck dissection found rates of local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) to be 97, 86 and 82&#x000a0;% respectively at 3&#x000a0;years, with HPV-positive OPSCC having even better outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Most patients had adjuvant treatment (RT/CRT), which increased toxicity. Single centre data on TLM in the UK is also encouraging. Data from Liverpool on 153 patients with T1-T3 OPSCC (66&#x000a0;% HPV positive) treated with TLM and neck dissection demonstrate 3&#x000a0;year OS of 84.5&#x000a0;%, disease specific survival (DSS) of 91.7&#x000a0;% and DFS of 78.2&#x000a0;%. Patients with HPV-positive OPSCC had a 71&#x000a0;% reduction in the risk of death. 83.6&#x000a0;% of patients received adjuvant treatment. (TMJ, manuscript submitted). Single institution data also show a functional advantage with upfront transoral surgery compared to primary CRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. A UK study compared swallowing function between 23 patients with locally advanced OPSCC treated with TLM +/- adjuvant therapy and 33 matched patients treated with CRT from a historical cohort and reported improved early swallowing function at 3&#x000a0;months in the upfront surgery group, using 3 different swallowing measures, including the MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Adjuvant therapy: risk factors, RT dose and use of chemotherapy</title><p>Currently, decisions about adjuvant therapy after surgery are based on the presence of pathological risk factors established more than 20&#x000a0;years ago in studies that included squamous cancers from multiple head and neck anatomical subsites and that did not test for tumour HPV status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. These risk factors include surgical margin status, presence of perineural and vascular invasion, number of lymph node metastases and presence of extracapsular spread (ECS) of nodal disease. The relevance of these risk factors in HPV-positive disease has been questioned and the optimum adjuvant treatment protocols for HPV-positive OPSCC are yet to be determined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Adjuvant RT after surgery for advanced head and neck cancers improved LC in the RTOG 73-03 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Subsequent studies recommended a minimum dose of 57.6Gy to the primary site and involved nodal areas and doses of up to 63Gy to areas of ECS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, lower doses of adjuvant RT may be sufficient for HPV-positive OPSCC based on the following: (i) observations that HPV-positive cell lines show increased radiosensitivity compared to HPV-negative cell lines in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]; (ii) phase II data (ECOG 1308) showing equivalent LC rates at 2&#x000a0;years with reduced dose RT (54Gy in 27 &#x000d7; 2Gy fractions) in patients with HPV-positive OPSCC who achieved a complete response after 3&#x000a0;cycles of induction chemotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]; (iii) use of lower doses of prophylactic RT (50Gy in 35 &#x000d7; 1.4Gy fractions, equivalent to 43Gy in 2Gy fractions) with no increase in recurrences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>The EORTC 22931 and RTOG 9501 Randomised Controlled Trials (RCTs) showed that adjuvant CRT improved LC and DFS compared with adjuvant RT alone in some patients with advanced head and neck cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. When the results of both studies were pooled, adjuvant CRT significantly improved OS in patients with positive (or &#x02018;involved&#x02019;) surgical margins and/or presence of nodal ECS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These pathological features are now widely used criteria for adjuvant CRT. There is variation in practice however, particularly around the issue of surgical margins with positive (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;mm) and close (1-5&#x000a0;mm) margins being grouped together in some studies. A survey of clinical oncologists from 17 UK centres reported that all would recommend adjuvant CRT for positive surgical margins (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;mm) whilst only 30&#x000a0;% would advocate its use for close margins (1&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mm) and 88&#x000a0;% for ECS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The relevance of the EORTC 22931 and RTOG 9501 study results should be questioned in the context of HPV-positive OPSCC. Patients in these studies had tumours from multiple head and neck anatomical subsites and the prevalence rate of HPV-positive OPSCC would have been significantly lower than the current rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Evidence for using adjuvant CRT after transoral surgery for OPSCC is also lacking. A retrospective study of TLM for advanced OPSCC showed that the addition of chemotherapy to adjuvant RT did not improve outcomes even in the presence of ECS, possibly because a high proportion of patients in that study had HPV-positive tumours with already excellent outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Dysphagia after treatment</title><p>There are several factors that may contribute to dysphagia after treatment. Dysphagia after RT has been shown to correlate with increased mean doses of radiation to swallowing-related organs, with a higher mean dose to superior pharyngeal constrictor muscle region and larynx being particularly associated with worse long-term swallowing outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The sigmoidal shape of the normal tissue complication probability curve indicates that increasing mean dose to pharyngeal musculature between 50Gy and 60Gy is a critical point at which risk of long-term dysphagia begins to inflect upwards, suggesting that reducing radiation dose from 60Gy to 50Gy could impart a clinically significant improvement in long-term swallowing outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Adding concurrent chemotherapy to primary or adjuvant RT increases the risk of dysphagia: a systematic review of TORS for OPSCC showed clear demarcation in swallowing outcomes across a variety of outcome measures in patients who received adjuvant RT alone compared to adjuvant CRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study rationale</title><p>Current treatments for HPV-positive OPSCC are associated with high survival rates but often result in significant long-term toxicities, particularly affecting swallowing function, that have a negative effect on QOL. Patients recruited into PATHOS will undergo transoral surgery to resect their primary tumours as well as a neck dissection. Post-operatively, they will be stratified into risk groups according to the presence or absence of pathological risk factors for recurrence. The aim of PATHOS is to determine whether reducing the intensity of adjuvant treatment after minimally invasive surgery in HPV-positive OPSCC, either by lowering RT dose in intermediate-risk patients or omitting chemotherapy in high-risk patients will result in better swallowing function, whilst maintaining excellent clinical outcomes. The primary outcome of the PATHOS phase II study will be long-term patient reported swallowing function measured using the MDADI score at 12&#x000a0;months post-treatment. Secondary outcomes will include local control rates and survival as well as a panel of objective and self-reported swallowing assessments. If the phase II study is successful, PATHOS will continue to a phase III study. The primary outcome of the proposed phase III study will be overall survival.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Methods/Design</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Study design</title><p>PATHOS is a multicentre, open label, parallel group phase II/III RCT funded by Cancer Research UK (CRUK).

Pre-operative imaging, pan-endoscopy reports, operative findings and pathology information should be used to delineate target volumes. The Clinical Target Volume 1 (CTV1) includes the primary and nodal tumour beds with a margin (1&#x02013;1.5&#x000a0;cm) and all pathologically involved nodal levels. Arms B1, C1, C2 receive 60Gy/30 fractions and Arm B2 receives 50Gy/25 fractions. The Clinical Target Volume 2 (CTV2) includes all at risk uninvolved nodal levels that require prophylactic RT. Arms B1, C1, C2 receive 54Gy/30 fractions and Arm B2 receives 50Gy/25fractions. Some centres may, <italic>a priori</italic> opt to boost high-risk sub-volume(s) for patients in Group C to 66Gy/30 fractions. Neck node levels for prophylactic RT should be outlined according to updated consensus guidelines and atlas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. A margin (3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mm) will be added to each CTV to produce the respective Planning Target Volume.</p><p>Dose constraints to the following organs at risk will be used for treatment plan optimisation: spinal cord, brainstem, parotid glands. Investigators are also encouraged to contour swallowing-related structures. These include the pharyngeal constrictor muscles (superior, middle and inferior), supraglottic/glottic larynx, cricopharyngeus, oesophageal inlet, cervical oesophagus and oral cavity and should be outlined according to the PATHOS atlas of swallowing structures, itself based on previously published guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

A functional outcomes panel for assessing swallowing function has been developed for PATHOS (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab3" ref-type="table">3</xref>). The following assessments will be conducted prior to surgery, 4&#x000a0;weeks post surgery and at 4&#x000a0;weeks, 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months post treatment: (1) MD Anderson Dysphagia Inventory score (MDADI); (2) Water swallow test (WST); (3) Performance Status Scale-Head and Neck (PSS-HN); (4) Quality of Life questionnaires (EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-H&#x00026;N35). Patients will also undergo a videofluoroscopy (VF) assessment prior to surgery, at 4&#x000a0;weeks post surgery and at 12&#x000a0;months post treatment. CTCAE Toxicity (v4.03) will be assessed weekly during and at the end of RT and at 4&#x000a0;weeks, 6, 12 and 24&#x000a0;months.<table-wrap id="Tab3"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Functional outcomes panel for multidimensional assessment of swallowing function</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Study</th><th>Description</th><th>Domain</th><th>Endpoint</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>MDADI</td><td>MDADI is a patient reported swallowing outcome measure, specifically designed and psychometrically validated for the head and neck cancer population</td><td>Swallowing-related QOL</td><td>Total/Composite, Global, Subscale Scores (continuous scores: 20 to 100)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="2">WST</td><td rowspan="2">100mls WST is a timed swallowing test.</td><td rowspan="2">Swallow performance</td><td>Swallow capacity (mls per swallow)</td></tr><tr><td>Swallow volume (mls per swallow)</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="4">VF</td><td rowspan="4">VF is the gold standard radiographic measure of swallowing function.

It is expected that over the duration of the trial, positive marginal biopsy rates for an individual surgeon will not exceed 10&#x000a0;%.</p><p>The Radiotherapy Quality Assurance (RTQA) programme for the trial will be coordinated by the National Radiotherapy Trials Quality Assurance group. A comprehensive RTQA guidance document has been developed to accompany the main trial protocol. In brief, this will consist of pre-accrual and on-trial components. Each site must perform a pre-accrual outlining benchmark case on one lateralised and one non-lateralised case. Sites may need to complete a pre-accrual planning exercise of a benchmark case, depending on participation in other national head and neck trials. Real time review of the first lateralised and non-lateralised patients recruited by each centre will be carried out before treatment starts, both for outlining and planning.</p><p>All swallow assessments will be conducted by speech and language therapists with the required level of competency, or appropriately trained research nurses.

Accordingly, up to five geographically distinct biopsies from the primary tumour will be harvested prior to surgical resection. In addition, up to two samples of involved cervical lymph node tissue will also be collected. Blood samples for research will also be taken before treatment and at 6&#x000a0;weeks, 6, 12, 18 and 24&#x000a0;months post treatment.

It also has approval from the Medicines and Health Care Product Regulatory Agency to be conducted in the UK. The Wales Cancer Trials Unit, a CRUK core funded and UK Clinical Research Collaboration accredited Clinical Trials Unit, is coordinating the trial. Velindre NHS Trust is the sponsor for the trial. A Trial Steering Committee and an Independent Data Monitoring Committee has been set up to monitor the progress and safety of the study. The PATHOS Trial Management Group, including clinicians, clinical trial unit staff, patient representatives, nursing and pharmacy representatives carry out the day-to-day running of the trial. PATHOS is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02215265.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25"><title>Discussion</title><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis of more than 500 OPSCC patients treated with TORS in 17 retrospective studies concluded that minimally invasive surgical techniques had a positive effect on QOL and long-term function as well as good oncological control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. The authors suggested that there was potential to reduce the intensity of treatment based on successful surgical control of disease in good prognosis HPV-positive patients. However, further validation through RCTs, like PATHOS, is needed prior to widespread shifts in practice. The RT dose of 50Gy in 25 fractions in the test arm (B2) of PATHOS was recommended by the National Cancer Institute Head and Neck Cancer Steering Committee Clinical Trials Planning Meeting on transoral resection of pharyngeal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. This reduced dose is also currently being used in a parallel US study (ECOG 3311) for transorally resected HPV-positive OPSCC. Another ongoing US study (ADEPT) is investigating if concurrent chemotherapy can be withheld in patients with ECS in the adjuvant setting. PATHOS is the only study to investigate both the effects of lowering RT dose and omitting chemotherapy in the same study.</p><p>PATHOS will allow clinical and pathological correlations of outcomes for HPV-positive disease, such that predictive factors for disease behaviour can be determined specifically in the context of HPV-positive disease. The study also provides a unique opportunity in the UK to standardise transoral surgical approaches for the treatment of OPSCC. It is imperative that in light of the increased uptake of these new techniques that surgical QA be established. This will ensure the rigorous application of appropriate and consistent surgical standards to allow valid comparison whenever these techniques are used in surgical trials and more importantly whenever they are used to treat patients. A panel of objective and self-reported swallowing assessments has been developed for PATHOS to allow multidimensional assessment of swallowing function. This panel will be prospectively validated in the trial and represents a step change in the standardisation of swallowing assessment in head and neck trials. Equally important is the fact that PATHOS will be the first UK study of post-operative IMRT for head and neck cancer. A novel aspect of the study will be outlining of the swallowing structures by investigators in participating centres. Dose/volume data for swallowing structures will be correlated with long-term swallowing function, collected prospectively in this multicentre randomised trial.</p><p>PATHOS phase II will open to recruitment in the UK in June 2015, with a planned recruitment period of 3&#x000a0;years. If the phase II study is successful, we plan to proceed to a phase III study to establish survival non-inferiority in the de-intensified treatment arms, which will require European collaboration.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>PATHOS</term><def><p>Post-operative adjuvant treatment for HPV-positive tumours</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRT</term><def><p>Chemoradiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CRUK</term><def><p>Cancer Research UK</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTCAE</term><def><p>Common terminology criteria for adverse events</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CTV</term><def><p>Clinical target volume</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DFS</term><def><p>Disease-free survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DSS</term><def><p>Disease-specific survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ECS</term><def><p>Extracapsular spread</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPV</term><def><p>Human papillomavirus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IMRT</term><def><p>Intensity modulated radiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LC</term><def><p>Local Control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDADI</term><def><p>MD Anderson dysphagia inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MDT</term><def><p>Multidisciplinary Team</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OPSCC</term><def><p>Oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>OS</term><def><p>Overall survival</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PSS-HN</term><def><p>Performance status scale &#x02013; head and neck</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QOL</term><def><p>Quality of life</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>QA</term><def><p>Quality assurance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RCT</term><def><p>Randomised controlled trial</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT</term><def><p>Radiotherapy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLM</term><def><p>Transoral laser microsurgery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TORS</term><def><p>Transoral robotic surgery</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VF</term><def><p>Videofluoroscopy</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WCTU</term><def><p>Wales Cancer trials unit</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WST</term><def><p>Water swallow test</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>ME, TMJ, JP, KH, CR, MB, NaP, NeP and CH are responsible for the research question, design of the trial and contributed to the writing of the study protocol.
