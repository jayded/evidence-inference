Several studies have shown that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) play a central role in the pathophysiology of venous and arterial diseases. Some studies have shown the efficacy of glycosaminoglycans, such as sulodexide (SDX), in treating patients with leg ulcers. The aim of this study was to evaluate clinical effects of SDX and its correlation with MMPs and NGAL expression in patients with mixed arterial and venous leg ulcers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Patients eligible for this study were of both sexes, older than 20 years, and with a clinical and instrumental diagnosis of mixed ulcer.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Fifty-three patients of both sexes were enrolled and divided into two groups by means of randomization tables. Group A (treated group) comprised 18 females and ten males (median age: 68.7 years) treated with standard treatment (compression therapy and surgery) + SDX (600 lipoprotein lipase-releasing units/day intramuscularly) for 15 days followed by SDX 250 lipase-releasing units every 12 hours day orally for 6 months as adjunctive treatment. Group B (control group) comprised 17 females and eight males (median age: 64.2 years) treated with standard treatment only (compression therapy and surgery). The type of surgery was chosen according to anatomical level of vein incompetence: superficial venous open surgery and/or subfascial endoscopic perforating surgery. In all enrolled patients, blood samples were collected in order to evaluate the plasma levels of MMPs and NGAL through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. These results were compared to another control group (Group C) of healthy individuals. Moreover, biopsies of ulcers were taken to evaluate the tissue expression of MMPs and NGAL through Western blot analysis. Our results revealed that SDX treatment is able to reduce both plasma levels and tissue expression of MMPs improving the clinical conditions in patients with mixed ulcers.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Inhibition of MMPs could represent a possible therapeutic intervention to limit the progression of leg ulceration. In particular, our findings demonstrate the efficacy of SDX in patients with mixed arterial and venous chronic ulcers of the lower limbs.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>mixed ulcer</kwd><kwd>arterial ulcer</kwd><kwd>metalloproteinases</kwd><kwd>neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chronic ulceration of the lower limbs is a serious clinical condition that induces pain and loss of limb function along with an impairment of quality of life and an increase in health care costs.<xref rid="b1-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In Western countries, the incidence of ulceration is rising in the population due to an increase in both life expectancy and risk factors for atherosclerotic stenosis, ie, smoking, obesity, and diabetes.<xref rid="b3-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Chronic venous ulceration (CVU), the pathophysiologic evolution of chronic venous disease, affects 1% of the adult population and is associated with a marked decrease in the quality of life and an increase in economic burden.<xref rid="b6-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Around 15%&#x02013;30% of patients with CVU have signs of arterial impairment presenting with a reduced ankle-brachial pressure index ([ABPI] lower than 0.8).<xref rid="b9-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Mixed ulcers are characterized by edema, eczema, hyperkeratotic skin, maceration, inadequate presence of granulation tissue, rolled wound edges, and delayed healing.<xref rid="b12-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> The biomolecular substrate of these manifestations is the change in both structure and function of the extracellular matrix (ECM).

NGAL positively modulates the activity of MMP-9, forming the NGAL/MMP-9 complex and protecting, in this way, MMP-9 from proteolytic degradation. Another important result is the high concentration of MMP-8, the predominant collagenase present in normal healing wounds. Over-expression and activation of this collagenase may be involved in the pathogenesis of non-healing chronic leg ulcers.<xref rid="b22-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b52-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p><p>The current results confirm the chronic nature of mixed ulcers and their tendency to slow down the normal healing processes. Recently, we and others documented in CVU patients that treatment with doxycycline as well as with a new nutraceutical substance modifying plasma MMP values improved both clinical symptoms and healing of ulcers.<xref rid="b51-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b53-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>Evaluating the inflammatory nature of mixed ulcers and the involvement of MMPs in the physiopathology of these ulcers, it has been suggested that some drugs mimicking the action of endogenous tissue inhibitors of MMPs may be used in the treatment of venous and arterial diseases, including mixed ulcers.<xref rid="b28-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b54-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b56-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> In particular, Mannello et al<xref rid="b32-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> documented that SDX is able to inhibit the MMP-9 gelatinase secretion and activity. SDX is a highly purified mixture of glycosaminoglycans composed of low-molecular-weight heparin (80%) and dermatan sulfate (20%).<xref rid="b57-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></p><p>Due to the concomitant presence of both fast-moving heparin, with affinity for antithrombin III, and dermatan sulfate, with affinity for heparin cofactor II (HCII), SDX shows lipidemic (&#x0003e;10 LRU/mg), anticoagulant (&#x0003c;100 IU/mg), anti-Xa (70&#x02013;100 IU/mg), HCII (&#x0003c;180 U/mg), Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (APTT) (~50 U/mg), and antithrombotic effects.<xref rid="b58-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">58</xref></p><p>SDX, as well as heparin, may be able to inhibit leukocyte function and the release of elastase;<xref rid="b59-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">59</xref> moreover, SDX also shows in vitro and in vivo profibrinolytic actions.<xref rid="b28-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b32-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>SDX is useful in the treatment and secondary prevention of ischemic arterial cardiovascular events,<xref rid="b56-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="b60-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> deep vein thrombosis,<xref rid="b61-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and systemic and local inflammations.<xref rid="b62-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> Moreover, Andreozzi<xref rid="b30-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> reported that SDX treatment is associated with significant improvements in the clinical signs and symptoms of venous ulcers, while Coccheri et al<xref rid="b55-dddt-8-519" ref-type="bibr">55</xref> documented in patients with venous leg ulcers that SDX associated with local treatment induced an improvement in ulcer healing without the development of side effects. In our study, we documented that SDX is able to reduce plasma and tissue levels of MMPs and NGAL. These effects may be related with the action of SDX on proteases that possess cysteine residues; we did, in fact, find that SDX has early effects on gelatinase (MMP-2 and MMP-9).</p><p>In this study, SDX treatment increased the healing of ulcers with an improvement in clinical symptoms and in quality of life of the enrolled patients. These effects showed a time-dependent pattern, with an initial improvement in the first month and with a complete remission within 3 months. During the follow-up at 6 months, we did not record any signs of wound disease and observed no side effects related to SDX treatment.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>SDX represents a safe and efficacious treatment for patients with ulcers of mixed etiology; however, further studies are necessary to validate the observations presented here.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-dddt-8-519"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Patton</surname><given-names>LR</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Are community leg ulcer clinics more cost-effective than home care visits?</article-title><source>J Wound Care</source><year>2009</year><volume>18</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>49</fpage><lpage>50</lpage><fpage>52</fpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">19418780</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-dddt-8-519"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hampton</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>An introduction to various types of leg ulcers and their management</article-title><source>Br J Nurs</source><year>2006</year><volume>15</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>S9</fpage><lpage>S13</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16835515</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-dddt-8-519"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Forssgren</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fransson</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name><name><surname>Nelz&#x000e9;n</surname><given-names>O</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Leg ulcer point prevalence can be decreased by broad-scale intervention: a follow-up cross-sectional study of a defined geographical population</article-title><source>Acta Derm Venereol</source><year>2008</year><volume>88</volume><issue>3</issue><fpage>252</fpage><lpage>256</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">18480924</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-dddt-8-519"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansson</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Swanbeck</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Leg and foot ulcer prevalence and investigation of the peripheral arterial and venous circulation in a randomised elderly population.
