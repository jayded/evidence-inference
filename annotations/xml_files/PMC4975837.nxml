As inhalation of dry cold gas is detrimental to mucociliary clearance, humidified nasal high flow (NHF) oxygen may reduce frequency of exacerbations, while improving lung function and quality of life in this cohort. In this randomised crossover study, we assessed short-term physiological responses to NHF therapy in 30 males chronically treated with LTOT. LTOT (2&#x02013;4&#x02005;L/min) through nasal cannula was compared with NHF at 30&#x02005;L/min from an AIRVO through an Optiflow nasal interface with entrained supplemental oxygen. Comparing NHF with LTOT: transcutaneous carbon dioxide (TcCO<sub>2</sub>) (43.3 vs 46.7&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, p&#x0003c;0.001), transcutaneous oxygen (TcO<sub>2</sub>) (97.1 vs 101.2&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg, p=0.01), I:E ratio (0.75 vs 0.86, p=0.02) and respiratory rate (RR) (15.4 vs 19.2&#x02005;bpm, p&#x0003c;0.001) were lower; and tidal volume (Vt) (0.50 vs 0.40, p=0.003) and end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) (174% vs 113%, p&#x0003c;0.001) were higher. EELV is expressed as relative change from baseline (%&#x00394;). Subjective dyspnoea and interface comfort favoured LTOT. NHF decreased TcCO<sub>2</sub>, I:E ratio and RR, with a concurrent increase in EELV and Vt compared with LTOT. This demonstrates a potential mechanistic rationale behind the improved outcomes observed in long-term treatment with NHF in oxygen-dependent patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12613000028707.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Long Term Oxygen Therapy (LTOT)</kwd><kwd>COPD Exacerbations</kwd><kwd>Non invasive ventilation</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>special-feature</meta-name><meta-value>unlocked</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The burden of COPD is increasing globally, and its physiological, economical and mortality costs are enormous, with &#x0003e;65 million people affected by moderate-to-severe COPD.</p><p>Long-term oxygen therapy (LTOT) improves health outcomes and reduces mortality.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, further optimisation of respiratory support may diminish symptomatic breathlessness, ameliorate COPD-associated cachexia, reduce hypercarbia, improve right ventricular function and provide psychological benefits.</p><p>Nasal high flow (NHF) oxygen, an emerging therapy developed for acute care areas for respiratory support, may have the potential for domiciliary use.

NHF use also resulted in increases in Vt, end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) and I:E ratio with corresponding decreases in RR, without changes to MV. These short-term findings, if confirmed over a longer duration in subsequent studies, could imply a role for NHF in the domiciliary management of patients with COPD dependent on LTOT.</p><p>Hypercarbia, respiratory acidosis and failure are all associated with increased risk of acute deterioration and poor outcomes for patients with COPD. Home NHF use with titrated or low-level supplemental oxygen may assist in avoiding these problems. How long patients should be maintained on this strategy for the benefits of NHF to be sustained is unclear; however, in a recent study of long-term domiciliary use of NHF, the actual exposure time to NHF was 1.6&#x02005;h/day.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The supplemental benefit of reduced TcCO<sub>2</sub>, reduced RR and increased EELV and Vt, combined with adequate oxygen to prevent hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension, is unknown, indicating the need for a long-term study in the domiciliary setting. This reduction in TcCO<sub>2</sub> correlates with the consistent rise in Vt, and we believe this increase may be accompanied by dead space and subsequent CO<sub>2</sub> washout, as seen in preceding COPD studies.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>The ability of NHF to reduce RR is consistent with a reduction in work of breathing. The mechanism is most likely the reduced anatomical dead space assisted by the positive expiratory pressure effect of NHF, which allows for improved ventilation and perfusion matching. Additionally, matching the inspiratory flow demands with NHF overcomes nasopharyngeal inspiratory resistance, thereby diminishing resistive work of breathing.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>In this NHF-naive cohort, higher dyspnoea and lower comfort scores were observed during NHF, perhaps due to commencing a new treatment in a cohort known to suffer from anxiety.</p><p>This study has some limitations that are contained in the online repository.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that in the stable home-oxygen-dependent male COPD patient, short-term NHF use results in reductions in TcCO<sub>2</sub> and RR, with increased Vt and EELV, when compared to LTOT. However, this cohort rated their LTOT interface more comfortable and providing more dyspnoea relief than NHF. This short-term study demonstrates adequate physiological rationale to proceed with trialling these devices in the long-term management of COPD, with the hope of reducing further physiological decay, improving quality of life and reducing hospital admissions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web Repository</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2015-207962-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e482" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD2"><caption><title>Web Protocol</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2015-207962-s2.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e487" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD3"><caption><title>Web figure</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="thoraxjnl-2015-207962-s3.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e492" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge the Respiratory Physicians for their support and Lisa McCarthy for her encouragement and assistance throughout the project.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JFF contributed to study design, manuscript preparation, data interpretation and manuscript review.
