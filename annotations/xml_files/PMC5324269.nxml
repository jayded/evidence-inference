Controversy continues on ergocalciferol (D2) and cholecalciferol (D3) relative potency as well as on dosing-schedule and sex role in raising 25-hydroxy D (25(OH)D) level, the best indicator of D status.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>We randomized 279 adults to daily D2, D3, D2/D3, or placebo; 2-weekly D2 or D3; or 4-weekly D2 or D3 (250,000&#x000a0;IU over/140&#x000a0;days). Randomization sequence, stratified by body-mass-index (BMI) and sex, was concealed from study coordinators and participants who were then blinded to capsules&#x02019; content. D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 Serum levels were determined blindly on days 0,1,2,3,4,7,14, and 2-weekly thereafter by high performance liquid chromatography assay. The results of 269 participants were available for analysis. Primary endpoint was area-under-the-curve (AUC) of 25(OH)D (25(OH)D2&#x02009;+&#x02009;25(OH)D3) adjusted for sex, BMI, and baseline 25(OH)D level.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Mean(SD) age was 33.0(8.5) year, 41% were males, and 85% completed follow-up. Baseline 25(OH)D level was 39.8(11.9) and increased by 3.3(11.6) and 28.6(16.3) nmol/L, in the placebo and active-treatment groups, respectively. AUC from day 0 to 140 (AUC<sub>140</sub>) of 25(OH)D was 40% (D3 daily) to 55% (D3 2-weekly) higher with active-treatment than placebo (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001). 25(OH)D2 AUC<sub>140</sub> was higher in daily than 2-weekly (17%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.006) and 4-weekly (20%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) D2-treated groups. 25(OH)D3 AUC<sub>140</sub> was lower in daily than 2-weekly (11%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.002) and 4-weekly D3-treated groups (10%, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.008). In D2-treated groups, there was 16.4&#x000a0;nmol/L decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001) with 25(OH)D2 level increase (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48) and baseline 25(OH)D level (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.58), in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn&#x02019;t increase. Incremental AUC from day 0 to 7 (AUC<sub>7</sub>) of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups were 118&#x02013;243% higher and 31&#x02013;39% lower, respectively, than incremental AUC<sub>7</sub> of D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups. Incremental AUC<sub>7</sub> of D3 and 25(OH)D3 in D3-treated groups and D2 and 25(OH)D2 in D2-treated groups were higher in females than males (55, 13, 64, and 28%, respectively). Baseline 25(OH)D level predicted response to D2 and D3 (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.001), whereas, BMI was significant predictor only for early response to D2.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25 (OH)D level may be dosing-schedule and sex-dependent. D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level may be related to total 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific. D2 may be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrial.gov identifier: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01170494?term=Hammami&#x00026;rank=4">NCT01170494</ext-link> (registered July 25, 2010).</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Cholecalciferol supplement</kwd><kwd>Ergocalciferol supplement</kwd><kwd>Sex effect</kwd><kwd>Dose effect</kwd><kwd>D2 level</kwd><kwd>D3 level</kwd><kwd>25-hydroxyvitamin D2 level</kwd><kwd>25-hydroxyvitamin D3 level</kwd><kwd>Creatinine production</kwd><kwd>BMI</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>King Abdul-Aziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), under National Comprehensive Plan for Science and Technology, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia </institution></funding-source><award-id>Biotech:10-MED 1362-20</award-id></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>The increasingly recognized effects of vitamin D (D) on skeletal and extra-skeletal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] together with worldwide D deficiency have amplified attention to D supplementation.

In summary, the data suggest that in the long term (20&#x000a0;weeks), D3 2-weekly followed by D3 4-weekly and D2 daily regimens may be superior in raising 25(OH)D level. However, in the first few weeks of treatment, the 4-weekly regimens followed by 2-weekly regimens appear to be superior to all daily regimens. Further, D3 2-weekly and 4-weekly regimens appear to be consistently superior to the corresponding D2 regimens, and D2 daily regimen appears to be consistently superior to D3 daily regimen. Finally, the increase in 25(OH)D level appears to be inversely related to BMI (mainly short term after D2 treatment) and to baseline 25(OH)D level.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Differential effects of vitamin D regimens on 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels</title><p>Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4a</xref> shows mean 25(OH)D2 level from day 0 to day 140 in the eight groups.

This together with higher D3 levels in the D3 treated groups compared to D2 levels in the D2 treated groups as shown above, suggest faster 25-hydroxylation of D2 compared to D3.

Predetermined secondary aims included comparing D2, D3, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 levels. The primary outcome measure was adjusted area-under-the-curve between days 0 and 140 (AUC<sub>140</sub>)<sub>.</sub> The main results were: 1) in the long term (20&#x000a0;weeks), the D3 2-weekly followed by D3 4-weekly and D2 daily regimens were superior in raising 25(OH)D levels. In the first few weeks of treatment, however, the 4-weekly followed by 2-weekly regimens were superior to all daily regimens. 2) D3 2-weekly and 4-weekly regimens were consistently superior to the corresponding D2 regimens; however, D2 daily regimen was consistently superior to D3 daily regimen. 3) 25(OH)D2 level was significantly higher in the daily compared to the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D2-treated groups, whereas, 25(OH)D3 level was lower in the daily compared to the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3-treated groups 4) The increase in 25(OH)D level was inversely related to baseline level, however, its inverse relation to BMI appeared to be D-type and time dependent (mainly short time after D2 treatment). 5) Daily, 2-weekly, and 4-weekly D2 regimens were associated with a similar and significant decrease in 25(OH)D3 level that correlated with the increase in 25(OH)D2 level and baseline 25(OH)D level, in one participant with measurable baseline 25(OH)D2 level, D3 caused a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level, while in the D2/D3-treated group, 25(OH)D3 level didn&#x02019;t increase. 6) The increases in D3 level in the 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3 treated groups were higher than the increases in D2 level in the corresponding D2 treated groups, the opposite was true for 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 levels. 7) Females had higher increases in D3, D2, 25(OH)D2, and 25(OH)D3 levels than males. 8) D treatment was associated with significant increases in urinary calcium and creatinine levels but not calcium/creatinine ratio.</p><p>All of the seven D supplement regimens in our study significantly increased 25(OH)D.

Although comparison is difficult because the dose&#x02013;response curve is curvilinear, with an average of 1786&#x000a0;IU/day, this translates into an increase of about 16&#x000a0;nmol/L per 1000&#x000a0;IU, which is consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].

In a multicenter, retrospective data extraction study, an average daily dose of 2700&#x000a0;IU D3 increased 25(OH)D by 11.8&#x000a0;nmol/L per 1000&#x000a0;IU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. It is to be noted that the recovered content of the capsules in our study was about 90% of the label claim and that compliance with study medication was 98.4 to 100%.

Due to our relatively frequent sampling, we were able to observe clear fluctuations in 25(OH)D levels when measured 2&#x000a0;weeks and 4&#x000a0;weeks after dosing, which may have clinical implication in term of monitoring response to therapy. Interestingly, the fluctuations were more pronounced with D2 dosing, consistent with shorter half life of 25(OH)D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Our finding that D3 is superior to D2 in raising 25(OH)D level when given 2-weekly or 4-weekly is consistent with the published literature.

A 2012 meta-analysis found that D3 is more potent than D2, interestingly the difference was significant in the 4 RCTs (48 patients) that used bolus oral or intramuscular doses but not in the 6 RCTs (146 patients) that used daily supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The interaction between D-type and dosing schedule was clearly shown in this study; while daily D3 was less efficient than 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3 in raising 25(OHD3, daily D2 was superior to 2-weekly and 4-weekly D2 in raising 25(OH)D2 levels. It is to be noted that the formulation of the capsules in our study was based on the common unitage that 1&#x000a0;IU equals 25&#x000a0;ng crystalline D2 or D3. Since the molecular weights of D2 and D3 are 384 and 396, respectively, 25&#x000a0;ng D3 would be equivalent to 25.78&#x000a0;ng, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] thus the potency of D2 may have been underestimated by about 3% if one considers molar equivalence rather than weight equivalence in determining potency in IUs. Our results suggest that for long term results, D2 is best given daily while D3 is best given 2-weekly. However, the 4-weekly followed by the 2-weekly (D2 or D3) regimens are clearly superior in in rapidly raising 25(OH)D levels.</p><p>We observed consistent decrease in 25(OH)D3 levels in D2 treated groups.

Further, 1000&#x000a0;IU D3 daily for 11&#x000a0;week did not change 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3 level, while 1000&#x000a0;IU D2 daily increased 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D2 level by 7.4&#x000a0;pg/ml and decreased 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3 level by 9.9&#x000a0;pg/ml [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>].

Several observations from our study may shed light on the mechanism(s) underlying these observations. We found that the D2-induced decrease in 25(OH)D3 level was similar in the daily, 2-weekly, and 4-weekly groups, that it was correlated with the increase in 25(OH)D2 level, baseline 25(OH)D level, and day 140 25(OH)D level, that there was no change in 25(OH)D3 level in the group treated with a combination of D2 and D3, and that when 25(OH)D2 level is measurable (one case), D3 treatment resulted in a similar decrease in 25(OH)D2 level. These observations suggest that the D2-induced decrease in 25(OH)D3 level may more related to the resulting 25(OH)D level rather than being specific to D2 treatment. In fact, in one study, 400 and 1000&#x000a0;IU D3 daily for one year resulted in an increase in 25(OH)D3 level with a concomitant decrease in 25(OH)D2 level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Interestingly, in a crossover study on high-yielding dairy cows, pre-administration of 10,000,000&#x000a0;IU of D3 significantly reduced 25(OH)D2 response to 10,000,000&#x000a0;IU of D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. It may be that there is a regulatory mechanism that increases the disposal of 25(OH)D in response to increases in its level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and that it has been observed with D2 treatment mainly because study participants commonly don&#x02019;t have measurable 25(OH)D2 levels. Since there was essentially no change in 25(OH)D3 level in the group that received combination of 1000&#x000a0;IU D2 and 1000&#x000a0;IU D3, it appears that, in a setting similar to our study (baseline 25(OH)D level around 40&#x000a0;nmol/L and average dose of 1800&#x000a0;IU daily), an amount of 25(OH)D that can be produced by 1000&#x000a0;IU intake is disposed daily. If such a mechanism really exists it can be exploited in defining normal 25(OH)D levels.</p><p>Consistent with the above interpretation and with previous studies, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] we found significant negative correlation between baseline 25(OH)D level and response to treatment. A recent review found that 17 out of 20 studies documented such correlation (3 studies had inadequate sample size and variation in baseline level), which may explain up to 20% of response variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A recent systematic review of studies that used modest daily doses of D3 (200 to 800&#x000a0;IU), also found negative correlation, albeit not significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The negative correlation together with the non-linear response in 25(OH)D level to increasing doses of D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] again suggest a regulatory step mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In our study, the significant negative correlation between baseline and increment 25(OH)D level was first seen at day 28 (when 25(OH)D level was 59.1 (14.7) nmol/L), suggesting a threshold effect. Interestingly, pooling data of 3 RCTs, subjects with single nucleotide polymorphisms (linked to D binding proteins and 25-hydroxylase) that are associated with the lowest baseline 25(OH)D level had the smallest increase in 25(OH)D level (32). Thus in some subjects, low baseline 25(OH)D level may reflect a genetic potential rather than lifestyle influence and may be associated with lower rather than higher increment in 25(OH)D level.</p><p>Higher BMI/body fat percentage was associated with smaller response to D supplement in several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. BMI may be a better predictor than absolute weight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] and was suggested as the most powerful response predictor to D supplement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Up to 34.5% of response variation may be related to BMI, more apparently with higher D doses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In a large retrospective study, mean increases in 25(OH)D level were 28.7, 23.6, and 20.1&#x000a0;nmol/L with BMI &#x0003c;25, 25&#x02013;29, or&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;kg/m2, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Nevertheless, not all studies showed such negative association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This may be due to the fact that higher BMI is also associated with baseline lower 25(OH)D levels, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>] which is itself positively associated with response to D supplement. In our study, BMI was a significant response predictor to D2 but not D3 and only during the first 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment, suggesting two additional potential modifiers of the relationship between BMI and 25(OH)D response to D supplement, D-type and time of assessment. The mechanisms underlying the association between BMI and response to D supplement are not clear. It was suggested that D and 25(OH)D may be trapped in access adipose tissue, as 25(OH)D is released with weight loss 1&#x02013;6 months following bariatric surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. However, total body fat storage may account for only 17% of the administered dose (extrapolated from subcutaneous fat), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and D and 25(OH)D may be also deposited in liver, muscle, and skin as shown in animal studies, suggesting that volume dilution may play a role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The relatively lower affinity of D binding protein to D2 and 25(OH)D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] makes them more accessible to extra-vascular tissues, which may explain our finding.</p><p>We found that the increase in D3 level was 2&#x02013;3 fold higher than the increase in D2 level (in the 2-weekly and 4-weekly treated groups). Few studies examined D2 and D3 after D2 and D3 supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. After similar doses of D2 and D3 (50,000&#x000a0;IU weekly for 12&#x000a0;weeks), subcutaneous fat D3 storage was 2 times higher than D2 storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Equivalent pharmaceutical doses of D3 and D2 in cows increased D3 level more than D2 level, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The difference may be related to the different structure of D2 and D3 side chains, theoretically causing differential absorption, binding to D binding proteins, inactivation by 24-hydroxylation, or activation by 25-hydroxylation. Absorption is not likely to be involved as studies of tritium-labeled D2 and D3 in healthy subjects found similar recoveries after oral dosing, however, D binding protein has double association constant to D3 compared to D2, and in vitro, mitochondrial 25-hydroxylase is 5 times faster for D3 compared to D2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. It is to be noted that most of the ingested D is not converted to 25(OH)D; an RCT found that oral 25(OH)D3 is 4&#x02013;5 more potent than D3 in raising 25(OH)D3 levels, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] Interestingly, in our study, 25(OH)D2 levels were higher than 25(OH)D3 levels, suggesting that the lower D2 levels were due, at least in part, to higher D2 accessibility to the 25-hydroxylase enzyme because of lower affinity to D binding proteins. It is of note that the combination of D3 AUC<sub>7</sub> and 25(OH)D3 AUC<sub>7</sub> was about 50% higher than the combination of D2 AUC<sub>7</sub> and 25(OH)D2 AUC<sub>7</sub>; indicating that a mechanism other than faster 25-hydroxylation (such as higher accessibility of D2 and 25(OH)D2 to extra-vascular tissues and faster degradation) is also involved. These mechanisms may apply only for schedules using high doses as 25(OH)D AUC<sub>140</sub> was higher in D2 daily than D3 daily treatment.</p><p>The higher levels of D3 compared to D2 may have important implication regardless of their impact on serum 25(OH)D level. Because of lower affinity to D binding protein, D2 and D3 have more cellular accessibility than 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 (except for the kidney, parathyroid gland, and placenta, where the megalin-cubulin system is expressed) and may have important physiological roles in breast milk and as substrates for many tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>We found that females had significantly larger (60, 55, 28%) adjusted AUC<sub>7</sub> than males for D2, D3, and 25(OH)D2 levels (and larger 13%,but not significant increase in 25(OH)D3 level). Females also had significantly 22% larger adjusted 25(OH)D2 AUC<sub>140.</sub>
</p><p>The results suggest about 49% better bioavailability of both D2 and D3 in females. Sex effect on response to D supplement has not been directly studied before. However, it is of note that D binding proteins are higher in females than males, in premenopausal women compared to postmenopausal women, in pregnant women, in women on oral contraceptives, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] and in postmenopausal women hormone replacement therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Further, estrogens increase hepatic 25-hydroxylation of D and the impact of D binding protein on response to D treatment may be partly D-type dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The observed sex differences may be related to higher D binding protein and faster 25-hydroxyaltion in females; although a sex difference in D absorption rate cannot be excluded. It is also possible that higher body fat and lower baseline 25(OH)D levels in females may play a role.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies using even higher doses of D, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] none of our participants developed hypercalcemia or hypercalciuria. In fact, the increase in urinary calcium/creatinine ratio was not significant. Nevertheless, the calcium/creatinine ratio may be misleading as there was significant increase in both calcium and creatinine urinary excretion. An increase in creatinine generation and urinary excretion has been described in patients with chronic kidney disease treated with vitamin D receptor activator, paricacitol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. The increase in creatinine excretion associated with D treatment casts doubt on the usefulness of ratios that include urinary creatinine (such as albumin/creatinine and calcium/creatinine) in evaluating the effect of D treatment on kidney function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] or D intoxication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>].</p><p>The strengths of this study include using repeated measurements, having a placebo arm, and ability to study several active-treatment regimens simultaneously, which enabled observing small changes and uncovering mechanistic insights. They also include effective randomization and concealment, partial blinding, frequent follow up to strengthen and verify compliance and verification of D capsule content across the study period.</p><sec id="Sec13"><title>Limitations</title><p>The interpretation of the results of this study may be limited by its sample size, 15% follow up loss, lower compliance with daily compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly regimens, capsule content that is lower than label claim, and capsule formulation based on weight equipotency of D2 and D3. The rate of follow up loss was similar across the groups, the characteristics of participants who completed the study were similar to those of the entire cohort, incompliance rate was 1 to 1.6% in the daily groups, and the discrepancy between capsule content and label claim was similar across the capsules; thus these factors would not be expected to affect the main findings of the study. Although the incompliance rate was low, it was measured by capsule count, which may not be reliable. Thus the lower dose&#x02013;response observed with daily D3 treatment compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly D3 treatments could be explained at least in part by incompliance. However, such explanation is not likely given our observation that the dose&#x02013;response was higher with daily D2 treatment compared to 2-weekly and 4-weekly D2 treatments and the fact that assignment to daily D2 or D3 treatment was random and blinded. The lower capsule content implies that the observed increments in D and 25(OH)D levels may have been up to 10% higher. Further, the fact that the molecular weight of D2 is about 3% higher compared to D3 indicates that our study may have underestimated response to D2 treatment. Nevertheless, such difference would not be expected to change the conclusions of the study. Further, the strength (in terms of IU) of most currently available D supplements is based on the assumption of weight rather than molar equipotency of D2 and D3. Another limitation of the study is that our findings may not be generalizable to lower or higher doses of vitamin D, or to subjects with different baseline 25 (OH)D levels, with different demographics, or with co-morbidities. Also, since the study was exploratory in nature, we have conducted multiple comparisons (including ad hoc comparisons), which would increase the rate of type 1 error. Further, the study examined surrogate endpoints (vitamin D and hydroxyvitamin D levels) rather than clinical endpoints. Finally, due to our assay sensitivity, we were not able to measure D2 and D3 levels in the daily treated groups.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We conclude that: 1) the effects of D2 and D3 supplements on 25(OH)D level may be dosing-schedule, time and sex dependent. In the long term, D2 appears to be most effective when given daily and D3 appears to be most effective when given 2-weekly. Further, females appear to mount larger 25(OH)D response to D2 than males. 2) The D2-associated reduction in 25(OH)D3 level appears to be related to the increase in 25(OH)D level rather than being D2-specific, as it is related to baseline 25(OH)D level and D3 treatment may be also associated with a reduction in 25(OH)D2 level. This together with the well known association between baseline 25(OH)D level and response to D treatment suggest a regulatory mechanism that may be exploited in fine tuning determination of normal 25(OH)D level. 3) D2 appears to be 25-hydroxylated faster than D3. 4) The association between BMI and response to D supplement may be more pronounced with D2 and during the first few weeks of treatment. 5) D2 and D3 level in response to treatment are higher in females compared to males. 6) D treatment is associated with an increase in urinary creatinine level, which makes assessment of D effect using ratios that include creatinine misleading.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D2</term><def><p>1,25 diydroxyvitamin D2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D3</term><def><p>1,25 diydroxyvitamin D3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>25(OH)D</term><def><p>Total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D2&#x02009;+&#x02009;25(OH)D3)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>25(OH)D2</term><def><p>25-hydroxyvitamin D2</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>25(OH)D3</term><def><p>25-hydroxyvitamin D3</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANCOVA</term><def><p>Analysis of co-variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>14</sub></term><def><p>Area-under-the-curve from day 0 to day 14</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>140</sub></term><def><p>Area-under-the-curve from day 0 to day 140</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>28</sub></term><def><p>Area-under-the-curve from day 0 to day 28</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AUC<sub>7</sub></term><def><p>Area-under-the-curve from day 0 to day 7</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMI</term><def><p>Body mass index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CI</term><def><p>Confidence interval</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CV</term><def><p>Coefficient of variation (standard deviation/mean)</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>D</term><def><p>Vitamin D</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>D2</term><def><p>Vitamin D2 or ergocalcifrol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>D3</term><def><p>Vitamin D3 or cholecaciferol</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPLC</term><def><p>High performance liquid chromatography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KFSH&#x00026;RC</term><def><p>King Faisal Specialist Hospital and Research Center</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><p>Jamjoom Pharmaceuticals, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia manufactured the vitamin D and placebo capsules.
