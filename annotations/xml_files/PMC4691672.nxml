Based on their structure, flavonoids can be subclassified as flavonols, flavones, flavanones, catechins (flavan-3-ols or flavanols), isoflavones, anthocyanins, and oligomeric or polymeric flavonoids. Experimental studies have shown cancer-protective effects of flavonoids through several biological mechanisms, including antioxidative and anti-inflammatory properties, induction of apoptosis, and inhibition of proliferation and angiogenesis (<xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Specifically, flavonoids have been shown to inhibit growth of human colon cancer cell lines in vitro and restrict colorectal carcinogenesis in animal models (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). A proportion of dietary flavonoids is absorbed in the small intestine and reaches plasma concentrations that could have biological effects. In addition, substantial amounts reach the colon, where they are further metabolized into metabolites that may also mediate some biological activity (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Current observational studies investigating the association between flavonoid intake and risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn3"><sup>12</sup></xref> have been inconsistent. Although several case-control studies suggest an inverse association between high flavonoid intake, particularly flavonols and anthocyanins, and CRC (<xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), prospective cohort studies have generally failed to detect an association (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). However, an inverse association between catechin intake and risk of rectal cancer has been suggested by a cohort study in women (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In addition, in a secondary analysis of a US-based randomized controlled trial, the Polyp Prevention Trial, higher intake of flavonols was statistically significantly associated with a 76% reduced risk (OR: 0.24; 95% CI: 0.11, 0.53) of advanced recurrent adenoma, a precursor for CRC (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). In the only study investigating biomarkers of flavonoid intake in relation to CRC incidence we are aware of, urinary catechins at baseline were inversely related to later risk of colon cancer (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>).</p><p>Dietary flavonols and flavones and CRC risk have been prospectively investigated in the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study (HPFS) and Nurses&#x02019; Health Study (NHS) previously, and no association was observed (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). A drawback of most prospective studies, including the previous analysis of NHS and HPFS data, is that only a small number of flavonoid subclasses (e.g., flavonols and flavones) were evaluated and intake ranges were limited (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In the present study, we have updated our flavonoid food composition database based on an updated and expanded USDA database (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>) to examine the association between habitual intake of various flavonoid subclasses (i.e., flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, and anthocyanins) and CRC risk in the NHS and HPFS, with longer follow-up and a larger number of incident cases compared with the previous analysis (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>), thus enabling us to investigate long-term habitual flavonoid intake as well as flavonoid intake with different latencies to better understand whether timing of intake makes a difference.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Study population</title><p>Details of the HPFS and NHS prospective cohorts have been published elsewhere (<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). In brief, the HPFS was initiated in 1986 and included 51,529 US male health professionals (dentists, optometrists, osteopaths, podiatrists, pharmacists, veterinarians) who were 40&#x02013;75 y old at baseline. The NHS began in 1976, when 121,701 US-registered female nurses aged 30&#x02013;55 y provided information on their medical history and lifestyle. In both cohorts, questionnaires were administered biennially to update lifestyle factors and elicit new medical diagnoses. Follow-up rates have been &#x0003e;90% in each 2-y cycle, and the cumulative follow-up rate (i.e., the percentage of potentially collected person-years) was 94% in the HPFS and 93% in the NHS. Dietary intake data were collected every 4 y in both the NHS and HPFS via a mailed food-frequency questionnaire (FFQ).</p><p>In the present study, we used 1984 as baseline for the NHS and 1986 for the HPFS, the respective years in which dietary intakes were assessed by using a validated 116- to 131-item FFQ. Among the participants who returned the baseline FFQs, we excluded those who had a history of cancer (except for nonmelanoma skin cancer) or ulcerative colitis, reported very high or very low energy intakes (&#x0003c;600 or &#x0003e;3500 kcal/d for women, &#x0003c;800 or &#x0003e;4200 kcal/d for men), left &#x0003e;70 food items blank on the FFQs, or had missing information on flavonoid intake. After these exclusions, 76,364 women and 42,478 men were included in the analysis.</p><p>The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Brigham and Women&#x02019;s Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of flavonoid intake</title><p>Validated FFQs (<xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>) were administered in 1984, 1986, and every 4 y thereafter in the NHS. In HPFS, similar FFQs were administered in 1986 and every 4 y thereafter. In the semiquantitative FFQs, food and beverage items are specified by commonly used units or portion sizes. In each FFQ, participants were asked to report how often, on average, they consumed a serving of each food item during the previous year with 9 possible response categories ranging from &#x0201c;never or less than once per month&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;6 or more times per day.&#x0201d; Individual nutrient intakes were calculated from FFQ data by multiplying the nutrient content per serving of each food by the indicated frequency of consumption (servings of that food per day) and summing over all foods. A database for the calculation of habitual intake of different flavonoid subclasses was developed as has been described previously (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). For the present analysis, 5 main flavonoid subclasses (expressed as aglycones) commonly consumed in the US diet were considered: flavonols (quercetin, kaempferol, myricetin, isorhamnetin), flavones (apigenin, luteolin), flavanones (eriodictyol, hesperetin, naringenin), flavan-3-ol monomers (catechin, epicatechin, epigallocatechin, epicatechin-3-gallate, epigallocatechin-3-gallate), and anthocyanins (cyanidin, delphinidin, malvidin, pelargonidin, petunidin, peonidin). Total flavonoid intakes were derived by the sum of the components flavonols, flavones, flavanones, flavan-3-ols, anthocyanins, and polymeric/oligomeric flavonoids (including proanthocyanidins, theaflavins, and thearubigins). As has been described previously, the main food sources of flavonols are tea and onions, those of flavones and flavanones are oranges, those of flavan-3ols are tea, those of anthocyanins are blueberries, and those of oligomeric and polymeric flavonoids are tea, apples, and strawberries (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Nutrient intakes were energy adjusted by the residual method (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>). To represent long-term dietary intake, we calculated cumulative average intakes for a given questionnaire cycle by averaging the intake for the current and preceding FFQs (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>). Because FFQs administered before 1990 contained fewer questions on some flavonoid-rich fruits and vegetables (e.g., onions were not listed in questionnaires before 1990), in sensitivity analyses, we used 1990 as baseline for both the HPFS and NHS.</p><p>Reproducibility and relative validity of the FFQs have been investigated previously (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). For the major food sources of flavonoids, correlations between dietary records and FFQs in the HPFS and NHS were as follows: 0.77&#x02013;0.93 for tea, 0.83&#x02013;0.90 for red wine, 0.74&#x02013;0.76 for oranges, and 0.70&#x02013;0.80 for apples or pears (<xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). In recent analyses in the HPFS and NHS, flavonoid subclasses have been associated with lower risk of several chronic diseases, including hypertension (<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>), ovarian cancer (<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), and Parkinson disease (<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>), giving further qualitative support for the ability of the FFQ to reasonably estimate dietary intake of flavonoid subclasses.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessment of covariables</title><p>Information on lifestyle and other health-related factors, such as body weight, cigarette smoking, physical activity, participation in gastrointestinal endoscopic examinations, use of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, menopausal status, and postmenopausal hormone use (in women only), was collected and updated in the biennial follow-up questionnaires. Family history of CRC in a first-degree relative was assessed in the 1982, 1988, 1992, 1996, and 2000 questionnaires in the NHS and in the 1986, 1990, 1992, and 1996 questionnaires in the HPFS.</p></sec><sec><title>Ascertainment of CRC cases</title><p>In both the NHS and HPFS, participants who reported a diagnosis of CRC on one of the biennial follow-up questionnaires were asked for permission to obtain their medical records and pathologic reports. Given the colorectal continuum model (<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>), we included colon cancers and rectal cancers. A study physician, blinded to exposure information, reviewed the records to confirm CRC diagnosis and to extract information on anatomic location, stage, and histologic type of the cancer. The National Death Index was queried to discover deaths and to ascertain any diagnosis of CRC that contributed to death or was a secondary diagnosis. In the case participants who had died of CRC were not captured during our regular disease follow-up, we contacted next of kin to ask for permission to obtain and review medical records to confirm a diagnosis of CRC. Deaths of all cohort members were identified through the National Death Index, the state vital statistics record, and death certificates that were mailed by next of kin of deceased participants, resulting in &#x0003e;98% complete ascertainment in mortality surveillance (<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). CRC was defined based on the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injury and Causes of Death (Ninth Revision) as a combination of tumors of the colon (C18.0&#x02013;C18.7), tumors that were overlapping or unspecified (C18.8&#x02013;C18.9), and tumors of the rectum (C19&#x02013;C20). All cases included in the present analysis were confirmed by medical records. Between return of the baseline questionnaires and 2010, a total of 1458 CRC cases (1151 colon, 307 rectum) were documented in the NHS and 1061 (831 colon, 230 rectum) in the HPFS.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Each participant contributed person-time of follow-up from the date of return of the baseline questionnaire to the date of CRC diagnosis, death, or end of analysis follow-up (31 May 2010 for the NHS, 31 January 2010 for the HPFS), whichever came first. We used Cox proportional hazards regression models calculating HRs (as an estimate of RR) and 95% CIs to quantify the associations of habitual intake of different flavonoid subclasses with overall and subsite-specific risk of CRC within each cohort. To control as finely as possible for confounding by age and calendar time, we stratified Cox models jointly by age in months at the start of follow-up and calendar year of the current questionnaire cycle. We tested the proportional hazards assumption by using likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without interaction terms between flavonoid subclass variables and age or follow-up time and did not observe any violation. In multivariable models, on the basis of our knowledge from previous investigations within the HPFS and NHS (<xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>), we simultaneously adjusted for CRC risk factors that may confound the association between flavonoid subclasses and CRC risk. These factors included pack-years of smoking before age 30 y, history of CRC in a parent or sibling, history of lower bowel endoscopy, regular aspirin use, menopausal hormone use (in women only), BMI, physical activity, alcohol consumption, total calorie intake, vitamin D intake, calcium intake, and consumption of red meat and processed meat. To assess whether potential collinearity between dietary variables may have affected our results, we also constructed a &#x0201c;basic model&#x0201d; (<xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which included all nondietary covariates, alcohol, and total energy intake and then added each dietary variable separately to the model. To represent long-term dietary and lifestyle patterns, we used cumulative averages for BMI, physical activity, regular aspirin/nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, and dietary intakes throughout follow-up to control for confounding in regression models. As a sensitivity analysis, we also adjusted for the diet quality scores from the Alternate Healthy Eating Index&#x02013;2010 (<xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>) and Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (<xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Our primary exposure of interest was cumulative average flavonoid intake between baseline and follow-up period representing long-term habitual flavonoid intake and minimizing the impact of random measurement errors in the dietary assessment by FFQs.</p><p>In sensitivity analyses, we evaluated the possible modification by time in the association between intake of flavonoid subclasses and CRC incidence. For this purpose, Cox models based on dietary data collected at different time points were constructed: <italic>1</italic>) flavonoid intake at the beginning of follow-up, <italic>2</italic>) recent (simple updated) flavonoid intake reported on the most recent FFQ before each follow-up interval (latency 0&#x02013;4 y), and <italic>3</italic>) flavonoid intake reported at different latencies (i.e., 4&#x02013;8 y, 8&#x02013;12 y, 12&#x02013;16 y) before diagnosis as described previously (<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). For example, for latency of 4&#x02013;8 y, flavonoid intake assessed on the 1986 FFQ was related to CRC cases diagnosed between 1990 and 1994, flavonoid intake assessed on the 1990 FFQ was related to CRC cases diagnosed between 1994 and 1998, flavonoid intake assessed on the 1998 FFQ was related to CRC cases diagnosed between 2002 and 2006, and so forth. Because the FFQs were administered every 4 y, the simple updated model 2 can be considered a 0- to 4-y latency analysis.</p><p>Intakes of flavonoid subclasses were categorized into quintiles based on the distribution in the study population. Tests for linear trend over quintiles were performed by assigning the median value to each category, entering these values as a continuous variable to the model, and evaluating its statistical significance by using the Wald test. All analyses were conducted in the NHS and HPFS separately, and risk estimates were pooled by using random-effects models (<xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>) if there was no indication of heterogeneity by sex. We tested whether the association between flavonoid subclass intake and risk of CRC was modified by age (&#x0003c;65 y vs. &#x02265;65 y), smoking status (ever vs. never), alcohol intake (high vs. low, based on sex-specific median value), or physical activity (high vs. low, based on sex-specific median value) by adding cross-product terms to the multivariable models and employing Wald tests.</p><p>All analyses were conducted by using SAS software (version 9.3; SAS Institute Inc.). A 2-sided <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c;0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Participants&#x02019; characteristics, averaged according to proportion of person-time in each quintile of total flavonoid intake, are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref> (equivalent tables for intake of flavonoid subclasses are available as <bold>Supplemental Tables 1&#x02013;5</bold>). In both men and women, physical activity was higher in participants with high flavonoid intake than in participants in the lower quintiles of flavonoid intake. Dietary intakes of red meat and processed meat were lower in the upper quintiles of flavonoid intake than in the lower quintiles. In the HPFS, during 419,133 y of follow-up, 1061 cases of CRC occurred (2.53 cases per 1000 person-years).

Dietary intake of blueberries (main food source of anthocyanins), oranges (main food source of flavones and flavanones), or tea (main food source of flavonols and flavan-3-ols) was not associated with risk of CRC in men or women.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>In this study comprising 2 large cohorts with &#x0003e;1,347,000 person-years of follow-up and 2519 CRC cases, we observed no association between habitual intake of any flavonoid subclass in relation to risk of CRC after multivariable adjustment. Thus, these findings do not support the hypothesis that dietary flavonoid intake is associated with a lower risk of CRC. To our knowledge, this is the largest prospective study relating habitual intake of various subclasses of flavonoids to risk of CRC.</p><p>Epidemiologic data investigating flavonoid intake in relation to CRC risk are conflicting. Inverse associations between flavonols, flavan-3-ols, and anthocyanins and risk of CRC have been observed in case-control studies (<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). However, because flavonoids originate largely from plant-based foods and beverages (i.e., foods generally considered healthy), differential recall of these foods by CRC cases compared with healthy control participants is a likely source of bias in these studies. Our findings do not support the findings from the secondary analysis of the Polyp Prevention Trial, in which flavonol intake was associated with a lower risk of advanced adenoma recurrence (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>). If flavonols truly influence the development of adenomas, we would expect that early flavonol intake should have a stronger association with risk of CRC than recent intake. However, the latency analysis gave only weak support for flavonol intake 12&#x02013;16 y before diagnosis being inversely associated with risk of CRC. Our findings also do not confirm the previously observed associations between flavan-3-ol intake and lower risk of rectal cancer (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) or urinary flavan-3-ols and lower risk of colon cancer (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), but they are in line with a meta-analysis including 3 prospective studies in which no statistically significant association between flavan-3-ol intake and risk of CRC was observed (<xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Furthermore, the lack of association between dietary intake of flavonols, flavones (<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>), and flavanones (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>) and risk of CRC observed here is in line with previous prospective studies.</p><p>Our results showed no clear association between anthocyanin intake and risk of CRC. In 2 previous prospective studies (<xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>), no associations between anthocyanins and risk of CRC were observed. It has been suggested that colonic microbial catabolites of anthocyanins may mediate biological activities, including anticarcinogenic properties (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Because the catabolic yields differ largely among individuals depending on the composition of the gut microflora, it is possible that in an epidemiologic study such as the present one, a reduced risk of CRC could have been observed only in individuals with a certain microflora. The growing research on the gut microbiome may enable future epidemiologic studies to take this into account.</p><p>Of the major flavonoid food sources, tea, oranges, and blueberries were not associated with risk of CRC in our study. This is in line with a recently published meta-analysis on tea (<xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>) intake in relation to risk of CRC and previous prospective studies investigating citrus fruit intake and risk of CRC (<xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>). We are not aware of any prior prospective study investigating blueberry intake in relation to CRC.</p><p>Although our study and the majority of prospective studies do not support an inverse association between dietary intake of flavonoid subclasses and risk of CRC, the evidence from experimental studies remains biologically plausible. In in vitro studies, flavonoids, especially flavan-3-ols and flavonols from tea, have been shown to inhibit growth of human colon cancer cell lines (<xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). In addition, it has been shown that flavan-3-ols from apples can reactivate silenced tumor suppressor genes in CRC cells (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). However, the evidence on protective effects of flavonoids against colon carcinogenesis is less conclusive in animal studies (<xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). It remains unclear whether anticarcinogenic effects of flavonoid subclasses observed in experimental studies play a relevant role in the etiology of CRC in humans because the flavonoid concentrations used in in vitro studies or doses used in in vivo studies can hardly be reached through habitual dietary intake (<xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). For example, studies investigating the effect of dietary intake of the flavonol quercetin on tumor formation in mice typically used a quercetin concentration of 2% in the diet (<xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Also, many human intervention studies investigating the effect of flavonoid intake on intermediary markers such as antioxidant biomarkers or carcinogenesis markers such as DNA damage used experimental doses that are difficult to attain with habitual diet (e.g., daily doses of 50&#x02013;500 mg quercetin) (<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). For comparison, median intakes of flavonols were 18 mg/d in the HPFS and 15 mg/d in the NHS. Bioavailability studies have shown that a 50-mg dose of quercetin leads to plasma concentrations of 0.75&#x02013;1.5 &#x003bc;mol/L quercetin (<xref rid="b49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>), which is 10-fold lower than the typical dose of 10 &#x003bc;M used in in vitro studies with colon cancer cell lines (<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). However, because a substantial proportion of dietary flavonoids reaches the colon (<xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>), it is expected that at least some of the biological activity, including potential anticarcinogenic properties, may act locally through colonic metabolites, but these effects are difficult to quantify.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. First, the FFQ was not specifically designed to investigate flavonoid intakes. Therefore, some foods rich in flavonoids (e.g., herbs) were missing from the FFQ, and foods with varying flavonoid contents may have been subsumed within one food item (e.g., apples and pears). Furthermore, flavonoid contents may vary depending on species, seasonal variation, maturity, and various agricultural, food-processing, and storage practices. These factors may have contributed to misclassification of flavonoid intakes, which may have led to an attenuation of observed associations, and thus may have obscured the detection of weak associations. Another limitation lies in the multiple comparisons that were made during this hypothesis-driven data analysis. We also acknowledge that our findings are not necessarily generalizable to other populations. Strengths of our study include the prospective study design; the repeated dietary intake assessment, which allowed for estimation of long-term intake as well as investigation of different latencies; and the large number of cases, which enabled us to investigate CRC individually according to location. Furthermore, the detailed data on potentially confounding factors are a strength and turned out to be important, because some of the associations that were observed in age-adjusted models were largely attenuated in the fully adjusted models.</p><p>In conclusion, our study findings do not support the hypothesis that diets high in flavonoids may reduce risk of CRC. The lack of association may be related to the low habitual intake of flavonoids, interindividual variation of colonic microbial catabolite production, and/or misclassification of flavonoid intake. Epidemiologic studies employing biomarkers of flavonoids may help elucidate whether the anticarcinogenic effects of flavonoids that have been observed in experimental studies may also be relevant in humans with habitual dietary intake.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors&#x02019; responsibilities were as follows&#x02014;KN, XZ, AC, MS, ELG, and KW: designed the research; KN and KW: had primary responsibility for the final content; KN: analyzed and interpreted the data and wrote the manuscript; WCW, CSF, SO, and ATC: obtained funding, managed and conducted the NHS and HPFS, and critically reviewed the manuscript for important intellectual content; EJO, JHL, TP, and EBR: assisted in interpreting the data and edited the manuscript; and all authors: read and approved the final manuscript and contributed to the revision of the manuscript.
