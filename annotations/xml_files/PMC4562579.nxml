Knowing that resistance exercise (RT) can enhance MPS, we examined whether RT could enhance MPS following 2&#x000a0;weeks of SR. In addition, as we postulated that SR may impair feeding-induced vasodilation limiting nutrient delivery to muscle, we also examined whether citrulline (CIT), as an arginine and nitric oxide precursor, could attenuate muscle anabolic resistance accompanying SR. We used a unilateral leg model to compare older subjects&#x02019; who had undergone SR to a loaded condition of SR plus RT (SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT). Thirty older men (70&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;years) underwent 14&#x000a0;days of SR (&#x0003c;1500&#x000a0;steps/day) with supplementation of either 5&#x000a0;g/day CIT or glycine placebo. Throughout SR, subjects performed unilateral low-load RT thrice weekly. We assessed muscle protein synthesis in the postabsorptive and postprandial state (20&#x000a0;g whey isolate plus 15&#x000a0;g glycine or as micellar-whey with 5&#x000a0;g CIT or 15&#x000a0;g glycine, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;10/group). As MPS was similar after ingestion of either whey isolate, micellar-whey, or micellar-whey&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;CIT data related to different dietary groups were collapsed to compare SR and SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT legs. Subjects&#x02019; daily steps were reduced by 80&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2% during SR (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) compared with baseline. Leg fat-free mass decreased with SR (&#x02212;124&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;61&#x000a0;g) and increased in the SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT (+126&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;68&#x000a0;g; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.003). Myofibrillar FSR was lower (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001) in the SR as compared with the SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT leg in the postabsorptive (0.026&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.001%/h vs. 0.045&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.001%/h) and postprandial states (0.055&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.002%/h vs. 0.115&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.003%/h). We conclude that low-load RT, but not supplementation with CIT, can attenuate the deleterious effects of SR in aging muscle.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Anabolic resistance</kwd><kwd>resistance training</kwd><kwd>sarcopenia</kwd><kwd>step-reduction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Sarcopenic muscle loss occurs at &#x0223c;0.8% per year beginning at around the 5th decade of life and arises, at least in part, from alterations in muscle protein turnover, such that a net negative protein balance prevails (Phillips <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). An &#x0201c;anabolic resistance&#x0201d; of protein metabolism in aging, which is embodied as an attenuated protein synthetic response to protein ingestion, is predominantly influenced by the contractile activity of skeletal muscle. For example, we reported 2&#x000a0;weeks of reduced habitual activity (i.e., daily step count) induces anabolic resistance to protein feeding in otherwise healthy older adults (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In contrast, resistance exercise is known to enhance muscle mass and can increase the sensitivity of skeletal muscle to dietary amino acids (Burd et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>).</p><p>Skeletal muscle disuse in older adults transiently accelerates muscle mass and strength losses and likely involve incomplete recovery (Suetta et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Hvid et al. <xref rid="b501" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>, <xref rid="b502" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Muscular disuse results in a reduction in postabsorptive (Gibson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Glover et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and postprandial (Glover et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wall et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) rates of myofibrillar protein synthesis (myoPS) and mixed MPS. Even modest reductions in muscular loading, via step-reduction (SR; &#x0003c;1500&#x000a0;steps/day for 2&#x000a0;weeks), induced muscle atrophy, and reduced insulin sensitivity in young (Krogh-Madsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) and older adults (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In addition, SR reduced the postprandial myoPS response in elderly subjects (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), similar to that seen with complete immobilization (Glover et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wall et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), which we hypothesized was partially responsible for the atrophy observed during SR (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). As a countermeasure to disuse atrophy, resistance training (RT) enhances the anabolic sensitivity of muscle (Burd et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; West et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b48" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and induces hypertrophy and strength gains in young and older individuals (Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Leenders et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Unsurprisingly, higher load/volume RT during disuse is an effective countermeasure to atrophy and strength loss (for review see [Glover and Phillips <xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>]); however, even at low volume RT attenuates disuse atrophy in young men (Oates et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), but the effects of such low volumes of work in aged persons during disuse/unloading are unknown.</p><p>Muscular disuse might impair feeding-induced vascular dilation and reduce nutrient delivery to skeletal muscle (Chadderdon et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) contributing to reduced postprandial MPS (Glover et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wall et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A decline in nitric oxide (NO) production with disuse and aging may be involved in this impaired vasodilation (Casey et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Citrulline (CIT), as an arginine precursor, ingestion could offset the reduction in the vascular impairments seen during disuse (Dai et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and thus may offset disuse-induced vascular impairment and atrophy. Ingestion of CIT has also been shown to stimulate fasted MPS in young persons on a low-protein diet (Jourdan et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) but has no effect on postprandial myoPS in healthy older adults (Churchward-Venne et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Nonetheless, animal models of chronic (i.e., &#x02265;1&#x000a0;week) CIT ingestion have shown benefits (Osowska et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>; Ventura et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b46" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>); thus, we aimed to determine if prolonged administration of CIT would be beneficial in older persons.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine whether low-load RT, previously shown to be effective in inducing hypertrophy in young men (Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), with or without chronic supplementation of CIT, would enhance myoPS following a period of SR in older men. Furthermore, the secondary objectives of this study were to determine whether low-load RT and/or CIT supplementation would attenuate SR-induced muscular atrophy and strength losses. We hypothesized that low-load RT performed during SR would enhance the anabolic sensitivity of muscle to a protein-containing beverage resulting in a greater postprandial myoPS rate. Furthermore, we hypothesized that lower intensity RT would prevent decreases in muscle mass and strength during SR. In addition, we hypothesized that supplementation with CIT would further enhance the muscle anabolic effects of resistance training and independently attenuate losses in muscle mass and strength through restoration of anabolic sensitivity in the SR limb. We also investigated if a micellar form of whey protein (Schmitt et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>) was similar in its ability to stimulate MPS as isolated whey protein.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty healthy, elderly men (70&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;years, 1.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.1&#x000a0;m, 84.0&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.6&#x000a0;kg; mean&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;SEM) were recruited through advertisements in local newspapers for this study.

During the 14-day SR period, subjects were instructed to reduce their daily step-count to ensure they completed no more than 1500 steps per day. Subjects monitored their own step count by wearing a pedometer (Accustep 400; Accusplit, Pleasanton, CA) and recorded their daily steps each day of the intervention before bed. In addition, subjects wore an armband accelerometer (BodyMedia, Pittsburg, PA) that verified the pedometer-derived step-counts, and also provided information pertaining to physical activity intensity and daily energy expenditure. The step-count data from the armband accelerometer were inaccessible to the subject and were used as an internal validation for the&#x000a0;subjects&#x02019; reported step counts to ensure compliance.&#x000a0;Interdevice values differed by &#x0003c;10% throughout the intervention.</p><p>Throughout the SR period subjects reported to the laboratory on six occasions (three sessions/week) to undergo unilateral resistance exercise (leg press and leg extension) using compressed air resistance strength machines (HUR Health and Fitness Equipment; Northbrook, IL). Subjects were collected upon arrival to the laboratory and transported by wheelchair to the testing center where they completed three sets of each exercise at 30% of their 1-RM until volitional fatigue and/or they were unable to complete the full range of motion required for the exercise. Exercised legs (SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT) were randomized according to dominance. During the exercise session, the inactive leg (SR) was left in a neutral position with no resistance so as to prevent loading of the knee extensors.

Body scans were used to determine body fat percentage, the total body fat mass (FM), individual leg FM, the total fat-free mass (FFM), arm FFM, individual leg FFM, and abdominal FFM. Skeletal muscle mass (SMM) was calculated using the predictive equation for lower limb SMM defined by Shih et&#x000a0;al.

Isometric knee extensor peak torque was determined during a maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) using a dynanomometer (Biodex System 3; Shirley, NY). Prior to testing, subjects were familiarized with the nature of the dynamometer testing protocol by undergoing at least one maximal contraction on each leg individually before proceeding with the test. Each unilateral test consisted of three isometric MVC of the knee extensors at an angle of 60&#x000b0; from the neutral 90&#x000b0; resting position. Each extension lasted five-seconds and was separated by 60&#x000a0;sec of rest at the neutral position. The highest recorded torque from each leg was taken as the highest peak isometric MVC. All settings were recorded to replicate conditions on both testing occasions. Isotonic strength of the knee extensors was determined by determining 3&#x02013;5 repetition maximum strength for leg press and knee extension using compressed air resistance machines (HUR Health and Fitness Equipment, Northbrook, IL) that allow 1&#x000a0;kg increments in resistance. Prior to testing, subjects were familiarized with the knee extension and leg press machines by performing a single set of nonfatiguing weight for at least 10 repetitions. Subjects rested for 2&#x000a0;min and then started the 3&#x02013;5 RM testing. Unilateral 3&#x02013;5 RM values were determined for both leg press and leg extension within four attempts with each attempt separated by 2&#x000a0;min and 1RM values were estimate to determine the appropriate 30% of 1RM load for resistance training.</p></sec><sec><title>Infusion protocol</title><p>Upon completion of the step-reduction protocol, subjects reported to the laboratory to undergo an assessment of fasted and fed MPS (Fig.<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig01">1B</xref>).

One arm was wrapped in a 45&#x000b0;C heating blanket to allow for &#x0201c;arterialization&#x0201d; of venous blood. After a baseline blood sample had been taken, a primed (2&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), constant (0.05&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000a0;min) infusion of L-[<italic>ring</italic>-<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>]phenylalanine was initiated (Cambridge Isotopes, Tewksbury, MA).

We report that rates of myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic protein synthesis were lower in the SR leg as compared with the SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT leg in both the postabsorptive and postprandial states. The finding of a reduced postprandial rise in MPS in the SR leg compared to the SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT leg is consistent with our previous work in this model with older adults (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), although it is possible that the difference between legs was the result of an acute exercise-induced increase in the SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT. We also found that leg FFM and SMM decreased in a leg that had undergone SR, but increased in the contralateral SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT leg. Contrary to our hypothesis, however, we did not find an effect of CIT supplementation in attenuating muscle atrophy, enhancing the muscle protein synthetic response, or altering vascular outcomes in either the SR or the SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT legs. Similar to our previous work, we found no effect of SR on strength (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>); however, we did find that low-load, high-volume resistance exercise was able to induce increases in leg press maximal strength (1RM) in spite of concomitant SR, with no effect on isometric maximal voluntary contraction force. As expected, resting femoral artery blood flow and diameter was not different between the groups; however, contrary to our hypothesis, we did not observe acute increases in femoral artery blood flow with CIT supplementation.</p><p>Previously, we reported that 2&#x000a0;weeks of SR decreased MPS in the postprandial but not postabsorptive state (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). In other models of muscle disuse (i.e., bed-rest, limb immobilization), there are reduced rates of MPS in both the postabsorptive (Gibson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">1987</xref>; Glover et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>) and postprandial states (Glover et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Wall et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b47" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). The effectiveness of RT in maintaining MPS during disuse is quite clear (Ferrando et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">1997</xref>). Moreover, we have demonstrated that low-load resistance exercise can enhance fasted myoPS and enhance its sensitivity to dietary protein for up to 24&#x000a0;h in young adults (Burd et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>). Interestingly, we found that myoPS was significantly higher in the SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT, as compared with the SR leg, in both the postabsorptive and postprandial states despite the last RT session occurring &#x0223c;72&#x000a0;h prior to the infusion protocol, suggesting that the myoPS response to RT is sustained in older adults. Importantly, the differences in myoPS between the SR and SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT legs seen in the current study are congruent with the differential changes in leg skeletal muscle mass we observed. However, since we did not assess pre-SR rates of myoPS, the difference in myoPS between groups in the present study may have been related to a SR-induced reduction in myoPS in the SR leg (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), and/or an RT-induced augmentation of myoPS in the SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT leg (Burd et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">2011b</xref>).</p><p>Similar to our previous work (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), we found a decrease in leg lean mass following 2&#x000a0;weeks of SR. Interestingly, we report that there were significant gains in muscle mass and strength despite concomitant SR, with thrice weekly low-load RT. Similar effects of RT, with much heavier loading protocols, in preventing atrophy during overt disuse have been shown previously (Kawakami et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Brooks et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). However, previously we reported that low-load RT elicits similar gains in muscle mass as well as strength in unpracticed tasks as a traditional high-load RT regime (Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). The results from the present study demonstrate that the loading stimulus required to prevent atrophic muscle loss during disuse can be minimal. These findings are supported by those of Gibson et&#x000a0;al. (Gibson et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">1988</xref>), who showed minimal neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) could offset immobilization-induced muscle atrophy. However, NMES may not always be as effective as RT in attenuating atrophy in older adults (Suetta et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b42" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Given the increase in leg lean mass and strength induced by low-load RT we observed, we propose that this RT regime may be an effective tool in, for example, rehabilitation in aging persons.</p><p>As compared to our previous investigation (Breen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), SMM decreased to a lesser extent in the SR limb in the current investigation (1.4% vs. 3.9%). Krogh-Madsen (Krogh-Madsen et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>) reported a 2.7% loss of leg lean mass in young men following 2&#x000a0;weeks of SR. We speculate that the smaller loss of SMM in the present study may have been due to a cross education effect whereby the strength of the muscles in an untrained limb increases in response to training of the homologous muscles of the contralateral limb (for a review see [Carroll et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>]). Recently, several trials have shown that the strength of an immobilized arm can be maintained when the contralateral limb undergoes resistance training during the immobilization period (Farthing et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>, <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Magnus et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). It is, however, equivocal as to whether cross education to an immobilized limb attenuates atrophy with studies showing no effect (Farthing et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>) or a relative preservation of muscle thickness (Farthing et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Magnus et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). These findings could be important since the preservation of muscle mass and strength of an immobilized limb by training the contralateral limb has implications for rehabilitation and/or postsurgical management of individuals with unilateral limb injury as has recently been suggested (Farthing and Zehr <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). It is also important to put our findings, seen in a two-week period, in some context of what it means in aging adults. Sarcopenic muscle mass loss is estimated at &#x0223c;0.8% per year (Phillips <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). In the current study, the step-reduced limb lost 1.3% and the step-reduced and resistance exercised limb gained 1.4% lean mass, respectively in only 2&#x000a0;weeks. The loss in lean mass that occurred over 2&#x000a0;weeks represents an almost twofold greater loss than that typically seen in 1&#x000a0;year with aging. Similarly, the fact that such a minimal amount of resistance exercise (thrice-weekly low-load, high volume resistance exercise) during step-reduction was not only able to completely prevent, but actually increase lean mass is, we propose, of clinical relevance. Our work serves, we submit, to illustrate just how important physical inactivity is in older adults who may struggle to regain muscle that they have lost due to inactivity (Suetta et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b43" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>).</p><p>Feeding induced microvascular blood flow is impaired in older adults (Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and may contribute to the reduced anabolic response to feeding in this population (Moore et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). It has been shown that pharmacological NO-administration (Timmerman et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b44" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>), walking (Timmerman et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b45" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), and resistance exercise (Phillips et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) can improve microvascular perfusion, amino acid delivery, and subsequently postprandial mixed MPS in older individuals. Since NO synthase expression and/or activity may be compromised with age (Casey et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), we speculated that CIT may, by increasing NO production [to enhance microvascular flow (Dai et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>)], increase amino acid delivery to the muscle stimulating myoPS and that this effect would be most pronounced in the SR leg. Contrary to our hypothesis, we did not find an effect of chronic or acute CIT ingestion in increasing conduit artery blood flow or enhancing myoPS with feeding in either the SR or SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT limbs. Our findings are similar to our previous work showing no effect of acute CIT supplementation (10&#x000a0;g) on microvascular flow or the MPS response to low dose (15&#x000a0;g) protein ingestion in older adults (Churchward-Venne et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). In contrast, Jourdan et&#x000a0;al. found (Jourdan et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) that administration of 11&#x02013;24&#x000a0;g of CIT over the course of 8&#x000a0;h increased rates of muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than isonitrogenous nonessential amino acids with consumption of a low-protein diet (0.66&#x000a0;g/kg/day) for the 3&#x000a0;days prior to the determination of MPS. Differing doses of CIT, age of participants, and the level of protein in the diet between the current study, our previous work (Churchward-Venne et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), and that of Jourdan et&#x000a0;al. (Jourdan et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) means the differing results are perhaps not surprising. The present dose of CIT (5&#x000a0;g) was slightly greater than a previous study that demonstrated a robust increase in plasma arginine concentration and markers of NO-metabolism with as little as 2&#x000a0;g supplementation; however, the authors suggested a clinically relevant dose of CIT to maximize arginine and NO synthesis may be as high as 10&#x000a0;g (Moinard et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Nevertheless, our previous work (Churchward-Venne et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) did incorporate ingestion of a larger CIT dose (10&#x000a0;g) and we did not see increased microvascular or conduit artery blood flow or muscle protein synthesis in healthy older men. However, our dose of 5&#x000a0;g in the current study and 10&#x000a0;g in our previous trial resulted in a peak plasma arginine concentrations of 190&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L and 248&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;17&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L, respectively, which as noted by Churchward-Venne (Churchward-Venne et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>), was much lower than the peak plasma concentration of 6200&#x000a0;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>mol/L that was found to increase vasodilation following intravenous arginine administration (Bode-B&#x000f6;ger et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). As such, the dose of CIT used in this study, despite being given for 2&#x000a0;weeks, may not have been adequate to improve the feeding-induced vasodilatory response. In older adults, a diminished NO-induced vasodilatory response to a single-muscle contraction has been established (Casey et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). A lower NO bioavailability in older adults, at least in part, underpins this attenuated vasodilatory response (Donato et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>). It has been speculated that impaired feeding-induced increases in leg blood flow may, at least in part, be responsible for the blunted MPS response to feeding in older adults (Phillips et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Mitchell et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), however subsequent studies have failed to link improvements in leg blood flow induced by resistance exercise training (Phillips et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>) or methacholine infusion (Phillips et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) to an enhanced MPS response. Taken together, the results of the current study and our earlier work (Churchward-Venne et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) suggest that CIT does not act to increase/restore microvascular circulation or MPS in healthy older men at rest, following exercise or following a period of inactivity.</p><p>In conclusion, our results support a role for low-load RT performed during SR to enhance muscle anabolic sensitivity in older adults. The greater anabolic sensitivity of the RT limb is congruent with the subsequent phenotypic changes in muscle mass and strength. Contrary to our hypothesis, chronic CIT supplementation enhanced neither femoral blood flow nor MPS in either a SR or a SR&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;RT limb despite dramatically increasing plasma arginine availability. Together these findings suggest a greater role for mechanical, as opposed to nutritional, stimuli to preserve muscle mass, and function during periods of reduced activity. Given the increased frequency with which older adults are exposed to short-term periods of overt or subtle muscle disuse, and the potential for incomplete recovery from such, the findings presented herein indicate that concomitant low-load RT is an appropriate strategy to offset the deleterious consequences of SR-induced muscle disuse in older men.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Tracy Rerecich, Alison McFadden and Todd Prior for their technical and laboratory assistance.
