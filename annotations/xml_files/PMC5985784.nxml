This study evaluates the surgical injury caused by two fundamental types of gastrointestinal surgical procedures (open surgery and laparoscopy) in relation to the inflammation elicited by alarmins.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>Patients undergoing MAS were divided into a mixed laparoscopy group (LPS) and an open surgery group (LPT). Serum levels of alarmins (S100A8, S100A12, HMGB1, and HSP70) and biomarkers (leukocytes, C-reactive protein [CRP], and interleukin-6 [IL-6]) were analyzed between the groups. The secondary objectives were to compare LPT and LPS cancer subgroups and to find the relationship between procedure and outcome (intensive care unit length of stay [ICU-LOS] and hospital length of stay [H-LOS]).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 82 patients were analyzed. No significant difference was found in alarmin levels between the mixed LPS and LPT groups. IL-6 was higher in the LPS group on day 2 (<italic>p</italic>=0.03) and day 3 (<italic>p</italic>=0.04). Significantly higher S100A8 protein levels on day 1 (<italic>p</italic>=0.02) and day 2 (<italic>p</italic>=0.01) and higher S100A12 protein levels on day 2 (<italic>p</italic>=0.03) were obtained in the LPS cancer subgroup. ICU-LOS and H-LOS were longer in the LPS cancer subgroup.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The degree of surgical injury elicited by open MAS as reflected by alarmins is similar to that of laparoscopic procedures. Nevertheless, an early biomarker of inflammation (IL-6) was higher in the laparoscopy group, suggesting a greater inflammatory response. Moreover, the levels of S100A8 and S100A12 were higher with a longer ICU-LOS and H-LOS in the LPS cancer subgroup.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>open surgery</kwd><kwd>laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>gastrointestinal surgery</kwd><kwd>alarmins</kwd><kwd>surgical injury</kwd><kwd>major surgery</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The increasing number of major non-cardiac surgical interventions is considered a global challenge in health care.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Extensive surgical intervention is associated with direct mechanical tissue injury, local hemorrhage, and ischemia, followed by hypoxemic cellular stress and ischemia&#x02013;reperfusion injury<xref rid="b2-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> leading to innate and adaptive immunity activation on the local and systemic levels.<xref rid="b3-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The dysregulation of the host response increases the number of infectious complications, impairs wound healing, and adversely affects other clinical outcomes, including hospital stay, mortality, and long-term cognitive functions.<xref rid="b3-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The degree of postoperative inflammatory response can be estimated by several clinical parameters (eg, heart rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature) and laboratory markers, including white blood cell (WBC) count, C-reactive protein (CRP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6).<xref rid="b6-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Clinical signs are unreliable and their sensitivity and specificity are low.

The Consolidated Standards Of Reporting Trials flow diagram of patient selection is given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-tcrm-14-999">Figure 1</xref>. The inclusion criteria were as follows: &#x0003e;18 years of age, absence of sepsis at the time of admission, and elective MAS. After surgery, the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit of the Department of Anesthesiology and Intensive Care Medicine, University Hospital Ostrava, Czech Republic. The exclusion criterion was pregnancy or life expectancy &#x0003c;24 hours.

The American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status classification before surgery was recorded. The severity of the condition was estimated using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II on the first postoperative day (POD 1) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment on POD 1&#x02013;3. The presence of systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) and sepsis at any time during the first three consecutive days after surgery was recorded according to the standard definitions valid at the time of the study.<xref rid="b17-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Outcome variables, such as postsurgical complications defined according to Clavien Dindo Classification, ICU-LOS, H-LOS, 30-day mortality, and in-hospital mortality, are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-tcrm-14-999">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>Blood samples for the analysis of serum levels of biomarkers (WBC, CRP, IL-6) and alarmins (S100A8, S100A12, HMGB1, HSP70 proteins) were collected from the central venous catheter at 6:00 a.m. on POD 1&#x02013;3. The blood samples were allowed to clot for 30 min and the supernatant subsequently centrifuged at 3,500 rpm (2,500&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic>) for 10 min at 4&#x000b0;C. Serum concentrations of CRP (AU 5420; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA) and IL-6 (Immulite 2000; DPC, Los Angeles, CA, USA) were assayed immediately. The interassay coefficients of variation were 4.8% and 6.7% for CRP and IL-6, respectively. Blood samples for the analysis of alarmins were centrifuged (2,500&#x000d7;<italic>g</italic>) at 4&#x000b0;C for 6 min and then frozen and stored at &#x02212;80&#x000b0;C until further analyses. The concentrations of S100A8 and HMGB1 were determined quantitatively by sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay or in-house assays (Biovendor-Laboratorni medicina, Brno, Czech Republic). The concentrations of proteins S100A12 and HSP70 were determined by commercially available colorimetric sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits (Biovendor-Laboratorni medicina, and StressMarq, Victoria, BC, Canada). The analyses of S100A8, S100A12, HMGB1, and HSP70 had inter-assay coefficients of variation of 5.6%, 6.9%, 10.9%, and 11.3%, respectively. The total WBC count was determined in a local laboratory immediately after sampling.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>R software (version 3.3.1) was used for this post hoc analysis (coauthor MB) and to create the figures and tables.

Almost all patients (93%, n=76) exhibited SIRS at some point during the first 3 days after admission. Only a small number developed sepsis (7%, n=6). The number of complications after surgery defined according to Clavien Dindo Classification did not differ between the groups.

On the other hand, dysregulation of sterile inflammation can participate in the development of postoperative complications and adversely affect patient outcomes. In this study, we showed that the majority of subjects exhibited SIRS at some point during the first three consecutive days after elective MAS. This immune response to surgery and postoperative complications maybe influenced not only by injury caused by a surgeon but also by the presence of bacteria and/or bacterial products in the intestinal contents, with contamination of the surgical wound, blood, and so on. In our study, all subjects received routine antibiotic prophylaxis (&#x003b2;-lactam and metronidazole). Due to the low incidence of early postoperative sepsis (7%), we consider the anti-infective prophylaxis to be effective in decreasing the risk of infectious complications.</p><p>Our selection of the particular set of alarmins was based on their already known roles in inflammatory diseases.<xref rid="b18-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b20-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> S100A proteins are responsible for regulating the intracellular metabolism of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and calcium-dependent signaling. The expression of S100A proteins is enhanced in inflamed tissues, where they activate endothelial and immune cells and facilitate the formation of local prothrombotic activity.<xref rid="b21-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> HMGB1 binds to DNA and influences many nuclear processes (ie, activation of nuclear factor kappa B, repair of DNA); it is released from the injured cells and activates immunocytes. Heat shock proteins, including HSP70, bind to nascent polypeptide chains and facilitate their proper folding, working as chaperones for other danger signals and protecting cells against unfavorable conditions, primarily thermal stress.<xref rid="b22-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> In preliminary data collection, we observed significantly higher levels of S100A8, S100A12, and HSP70 in surgical patients compared to healthy subjects.<xref rid="b23-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> This suggests that alarmins participate in physiologic responses to surgical injury. Biomarkers, such as WBC count, CRP, IL-6, and albumin, reflect various types of injury, including infectious diseases, sterile trauma damage, and major surgery.<xref rid="b8-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b24-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Laparoscopic procedures in gastrointestinal surgery are usually preferred to open surgery, especially due to the less invasiveness (smaller incision),<xref rid="b26-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> less postsurgical pain, reduced risk of infectious complication, faster functional recovery, and better outcomes.<xref rid="b12-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b27-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> To date, no study has evaluated the invasiveness of surgical procedures during MAS in relation to serum alarmin levels. We found no significant difference in alarmin levels between the LPS and LPT groups, including all surgical diagnoses. Therefore, overall degree of tissue injury reflected by alarmins seems to be similar in both types of surgical procedures.</p><p>Significantly higher levels of some alarmins (S100A8, S100A12) were obtained in the LPS cancer subgroup. This confirms a higher expression of S100A proteins in cancer,<xref rid="b28-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> as reflected by their more pronounced systemic release after laparoscopic surgery for cancer.</p><p>Ramanathan et al described significantly higher CRP levels in patients undergoing extensive open resection of the large intestine, compared to laparoscopic procedures. CRP had no discriminative value related to postoperative infective complications. However, the authors did not describe some of the baseline (ie, weight, body mass index) and surgical characteristics (ie, duration of surgery, blood loss, use of vasopressors).<xref rid="b24-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> On the contrary, we observed no differences in CRP levels between the colorectal resection subgroups during similar postoperative periods. Moreover, we found significantly higher levels of IL-6 in the LPS cancer subgroup, suggesting a greater inflammatory host response to laparoscopy, probably reflecting the longer surgery time and higher blood loss requiring higher amount of intraoperatively administered fluids.<xref rid="b29-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b30-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> The different findings for CRP values maybe explained by the statistical error related to fewer subjects enrolled in our study and the potentially different baseline and surgical characteristics between the studies. Fretland et al studied the influence of the type of surgery (LPS/LPT) on changes in biomarker levels after liver resection for colorectal liver metastases. The authors found higher levels of HMGB1, IL-6, CRP, cell-free DNA, and macrophage inflammatory protein 1&#x003b2; in the open surgery group.<xref rid="b31-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> This is again only in partial agreement with our study, because we found no difference in HMGB1 and CRP levels. These results may be explained by differences in organ-specific resections. However, we observed a significant difference in IL-6 laparoscopy group, suggesting a greater inflammatory response despite the levels of selected alarmins being similar. We suggest that a different set of alarmins other than those presently selected might be responsible for the observed inflammatory response.</p><p>We found significantly reduced ICU-LOS and H-LOS in the LPT cancer subgroup. These findings partially contradict the results reported by Zhuang et al, who described reduced H-LOS in cancer patients who underwent LPSs<xref rid="b32-tcrm-14-999" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> even in the setting of suboptimal use of the enhanced recovery after surgery protocol. Interestingly, we did not observe any significant differences in ICU-LOS and H-LOS between the LPS and LPT groups for all subjects undergoing MAS. We assume that this was due to the heterogeneity of the intervention used in different gastrointestinal sites and variability in the type and extensiveness of surgical diagnosis.</p><p>This study has several limitations. The first limitation is that it was designed as a post hoc analysis. The second limitation is the small numbers of subjects. Third, the intervals at which we sampled blood may not reflect exactly the dynamics of the blood concentration of alarmins. Fourth, a different set of alarmins may be responsible for the observed immune response, such as mitochondrial alarmins (mtDNA, <italic>N</italic>-formyl-Met-Leu-Phe); thus, the physiologic role of our selected set of alarmins in the development of inflammatory response could only be minor. Fifth, the various degrees and types of cancer as well as the position of gastrointestinal tract resection are potential sources of further bias.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Both open surgery and laparoscopy can cause significant damage to the tissues. This study compares the degree of injury caused by these two main types of surgical procedures, as reflected by alarmins (danger signals and markers of tissue damage) and selected inflammatory biomarkers.</p><p>The degree of surgical injury elicited by open MAS as reflected by alarmins was similar to that of laparoscopic procedures. However, the laparoscopic surgery, especially for gastrointestinal cancer, seems to be injurious than open procedures, reflecting the longer surgery time and higher blood loss of the procedures. This is suggested by not only higher levels of biomarkers (IL-6) but also alarmins (S100A8 and S100A12), the markers of cellular damage more accurately estimating the degree of surgical injury.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Michal Burda was supported by the NPU II project LQ1602 &#x0201c;IT4Innovations excellence in science&#x0201d; provided by the M&#x00160;MT.
