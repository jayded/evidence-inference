This study protocol was approved by the ethic committee. Patients were directed to sedoanalgesia after unsuccessful tooth extraction attempts with local anesthesia or when they were uncooperative (mentally retarded etc.). Data were obtained from anesthesia records. Patients with incomplete data, with operation time longer than 20 minutes, who had active upper respiratory airway infection, lung infection or inflammatory disease, previous history of dental extraction and patients who did not met the 6 hours famine criteria did not receive sedoanalgesia thus were excluded from the study. Patients included in the study all met the 6 hours of famine criteria and patients and parents were informed about sedoanalgesia and tooth extraction. Before procedures all children were evaluated and physical examinations were made, further laboratory examination and consultations were demanded in cases of need.</p><p>Procedures took place in our department&#x02019;s operation room and electrocardiography (EKG), heart beat rate (HBR), mean non-invasive arterial pressure (MNAP) and peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) was monitored (Nihon Kohden Bedside Monitor&#x000ae; model BSM-4113K-Japan) for all patients. Patients who enabled catheter insertion were administered intravenous (IV) 1-2mg kg<sup>-1</sup> Ketamine (Ketalar&#x000ae;, Pfizer, New York, USA). If the patients need additional doses of ketamine for maintaining sedation level, 0.25-0.5 mg/kg iv ketamine were added.</p><p>Patients who did not allow intravenous line insertion were administered %50/50 O<sub>2</sub>/N<sub>2</sub>O containing 6% sevoflurane via mask. Sedation level was aimed to be Modified Ramsey Sedation Scale (MRSS) = 4.</p><p>Patients who reached MRSS=4 were oxygenized 4L/minute, with nasal cannula and administered local infiltration anesthesia (Ultracain&#x000ae;). Patients who were administered inhalation anesthesia (IA) were oxygenized 4L/minute when MRSS 4 was reached and other inhalation agents were ceased.</p><p>Patient age, body weight, gender, ASA risk class, additional systemic diseases, anesthetic agents used during procedure, number of extracted teeth, side effects observed during and after procedure and surgeon satisfaction were retrospectively evaluated using archived data. Postoperative recovery agitation or delirium was evaluated with Watcha Behavior Scale (1:Calm, 2:Crying, but can be consoled, 3:Crying, cannot be consoled, 4:Agitated and thrashing around).</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was made using SPSS 12.0 computer program using the below stated tests. Statistical analysis data were presented as Mean&#x000b1;Standart Deviation (SD). Statistical significance was accepted p&#x0003c;0.05 in all analysis. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to all measurable parameters to identify normal or abnormal distribution. To identify difference between groups in normally distributed data, Student-t test was used in independent groups. Gender, ASA, additional systemic diseases, side effects and surgeon satisfaction evaluation was made with Chi-square and Fisher&#x02019;s exact Chi-square tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>As result of data evaluation it was detected that 922 patients under age of 18 underwent sedation/analgesia for tooth extraction.

Dental anxiety is influenced by various factors including age, gender, and socioeconomic conditions.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Many studies have shown the inverse correlation between age and dental anxiety levels. Dental anxiety has shown to decrease by the age of 6-7 and that children can cope with the fears that cause dental anxiety more efficiently.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Mean age of 922 patients who underwent tooth extractions under sedoanalgesia was in line with literature.</p><p>Mean age of patients in Group 1 was found to be significantly higher than patients in Group 2 (p&#x0003c;0.0001). The lower age group did not allow catheter insertion thus were administered IA and were included in Group 2. We are of the opinion that this is the main reason for the age difference between two groups.</p><p>When gender and dental anxiety levels are correlated, although contradictory, many studies state that males tend to have higher levels than females.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In line, 61.2% of 922 patients included in our study were male. However other sociological factors contributing to this result may be present.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>-<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>A study conducted with patients with dental anxiety came to the conclusion that these patients had more caries counts, less teeth with fillings and more missing teeth, did not continue follow-ups regularly and had more emergency administrations in order to treat dental pain and infections.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>-<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In our study minimum one and maximum 13 teeth extraction was noted. We associated this gross number of extraction indication to dental anxiety thus delayed dentist examinations.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></p><p>Dental anxiety is reported to be 3-43% in the pediatric population.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> When behavioral methods are insufficient in eliminating this condition, sedoanalgesia or general anesthesia is needed. Sedation in which the patient is cooperative and the physiological reflexes are protected is usually preferred over general anesthesia<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> in the same way as our department. Like appropriate patient selection for ambulatory dental practice, short-term anesthetics, which have little side effects and provide fast recovery, are reported to decrease morbidity rate.<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Today, ketamine is the only known anesthetic agent with analgesic, hypnotic and amnestic effects, which also protects pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes and does not evoke cardiovascular and respiratory depression. In anesthesia literature, ketamine is the anesthetic agent of choice for obtaining sedation in the pediatric population during dental procedures.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> It is an effective agent for painful and unpleasant diagnostic and therapeutic procedures in dental practice, which provides analgesia, sedation, anxiolysis, amnesia, and a short duration of motor control.<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The most commonly used inhalation agent used in dental practice is nitrous oxide. Although this agent has strong analgesic potency strength, it is a weak anesthetic agent and may be insufficient in patients with high anxiety levels. In our department, children who underwent examination in our pediatric clinic and did not allow examination, or who did not consent tooth extraction in the clinic after at least two attempts are directed to sedoanalgesia thus have high fear and anxiety levels. Therefore we aim MRSS level 4 in our sedation practice and give preference to sevoflurane, which has lower blood-gas solubility compared to other inhalation agents, has fast-paced effect, which ends fast and does not cause airway irritation.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>-<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> When 2400 closed cases in the USA were evaluated, it was observed that 238 of these cases were pediatric, which involved respiratory problems different from adults and was concluded that the mortality rate could be decreased with better monitorization.<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Another study evaluated 95 cases in hospitals and private practice and concluded that 78% of cases where pulse oximeter monitoring was not present, unwanted occurrence was associated with mortality or neurological deficits whereas this rate decreased to 28% in patients who were monitorized with pulse oximeter.<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> In our practice we choose to monitor respiratory and circulatory system functions (EKG, HBR, MNAP and SpO<sub>2</sub>) and oxygenized the patients with nasal cannula in order to prevent these possible complications. We have not come across respiratory complications or any serious desaturation or severe emergency agitation or delirium during our practice. Patient MRSS levels were evaluated closely in order to prevent cardiorespiratory complications associated to deepening of anesthesia.</p><p>The main adverse effect is vomiting reported in approximately 10% of pediatric patients undergoing sedoanalgesia.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Nausea after ketamine administration seems to be associated with increasing age.<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Ozkan et al.<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> reported 12.1% nausea and 7.9% vomiting during their practice of elective surgery in the pediatric population. Salleeh et al.<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> used ketamine in 179 pediatric emergency patients for painful and traumatic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and reported 60% of vomiting to be the most frequently observed side effect. In our study 30 patients in Group 1 (3.3%) had nausea in line with literature, but we did not come across vomiting. We are of the opinion that this result is related with our administration of antiemetic medication in children with nausea.</p><p>In literature a 3-year-old child is reported to develop skin rashes and anaphylactoid reaction with intramuscular ketamine administration.<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> We are of the opinion that in our study, eritematous skin reactions, which regressed spontaneously in 26 patients (3.2%) in Group 1 were caused by fast injections and following acute increase in plasma histamine levels.</p><p>The emergence of agitation (EA) occurrence in children after sevoflurane anesthesia is common, with a reported incidence up to 80%. EA is characterized by restlessness, inconsolable crying, agitation, disorientation, delusion, hallucination and cognitive changes plus memory impairment. EA in children is generally short-lived with no after-effect, however, it is a troublesome phenomenon, because it can result in injury to the patient or damage to the surgical site, leads to dissatisfaction and anxiety for the parents, and requires extra nursing care with associated costs.<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> In our research we determined EA in two groups. But EA was more comman in Group 2 than Group 1.</p><p>When surgeon satisfaction was evaluated, 95.5% of surgeons found IV anesthesia to be &#x02018;Excellent&#x02019; while 18% of surgeons found IA to be &#x02018;Excellent&#x02019;. When satisfaction rate was compared there was a significant difference in Group 1 and Group 2. Surgeon&#x02019;s thought on what brought this difference out was that they could start the procedure more quickly when IV anesthesia was administered and that the effect of anesthesia terminated more quickly (MRSS 2 level achieved), again gaining time for the surgeon. Other causes were that after being sent to the recovery room and after total recovery, children did not remember the procedure and did not cry when they saw the surgeon and that less gas was polluting the operating room.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Dental anxiety in the early ages and high prevalence leads to the need of sedoanalgesia during dental procedures of these children. Ketamine is an effective and safe agent with analgesic, hypnotic and amnestic affects, does not alter pharyngeal and laryngeal reflexes and minimizes aspiration possibility during procedure.
