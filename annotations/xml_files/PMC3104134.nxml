The data on efficacy of eradication therapy in a group of rheumatology patients on long-term NSAID therapy are reported here. This study was part of a nationwide, multicenter RCT that took place in 2000&#x02013;2002 in the Netherlands. Patients who tested positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic> IgG antibodies were included and randomly assigned to either eradication PPI-triple therapy or placebo.

The American College of Gastroenterology recommends that when an endoscopy is not performed, a serological test, which is the least expensive means of evaluating for evidence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection, should be done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. When endoscopy is indicated, biopsy specimens can be taken for microscopic demonstration of the organism, culture, histology or urease testing. Nowadays, in the Netherlands, biopsies are not routinely sent for culture and susceptibility testing of the infecting strain because of the high costs.</p><p>Apart from patient compliance, resistance of <italic>Helicobacter pylori</italic> to antibiotics can decrease the success of <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy. Regimens of choice for eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> should be guided by local antibiotic resistance rates. In the Netherlands, the overall prevalence of resistance to clarithromycin and metronidazol was lower than in some surrounding countries possibly due to restrictive use of antimicrobials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The advised treatment in the Netherlands consists of a proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-triple therapy for 7&#x000a0;days without prior susceptibility testing. An increase of resistance rates to antimicrobial agents is however expected because increasing number of patients treated and increasing consumption of antibiotics, in particular macrolides, was observed in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The aim of the present study was firstly, to determine the efficacy of 7-day PPI-triple therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic> in a well-defined group of patients with a rheumatic disease and serologic evidence of <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection who were on long-term NSAID therapy and secondly, to get insight in the prevalence of antibiotic resistance of <italic>H. pylori</italic> in the studied population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was part of a placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial of which the clinical results have been described elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], wherein we described that <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication has no beneficial effect on the incidence of gastroduodenal ulcers or occurrence of dyspepsia in patients on long-term NSAID treatment. Between May 2000 and June 2002, patients were recruited from eight rheumatology outpatient departments in six cities in the Netherlands. Patients with a rheumatic disease were eligible for inclusion if they were between 40 and 80&#x000a0;years of age, were positive for <italic>H. pylori</italic> on serological testing and were on long-term NSAID treatment. Forty-eight percent used a gastroprotective drug (7% H2 receptor antagonists [H2RA], 37% proton pump inhibitors [PPI], 7% misoprostol, 3% used a combination of these). Exclusion criteria were previous eradication therapy for <italic>H. pylori</italic>, known allergy for the study medication or presence of severe concomitant disease.</p><p>Serologic testing for <italic>H. pylori</italic> IgG-antibodies was performed with a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (Pyloriset&#x000ae; new EIA-G, Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. A serum sample was considered positive for IgG antibodies to <italic>H. pylori</italic> if the test result was &#x02265;250 International Units (IU). This assay has been assessed, in a population similar to the population in the presented trial, and has proven a sensitivity and specificity in the Netherlands of 98&#x02013;100% and 79&#x02013;85%, even in patients on acid suppressive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The study protocol was approved by research and medical ethics committees of all participating centers and all patients gave written informed consent.</p><p>After stratification by concurrent use of gastroprotective agents (proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor antagonists or misoprostol, but not prokinetics, or antacids), patients were randomly assigned to receive either <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy with omeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg, amoxicillin 1000&#x000a0;mg, and clarithromycin 500&#x000a0;mg (OAC) twice daily for 7&#x000a0;days or placebo. Patients with an allergy for amoxicillin were treated with omeprazole 20&#x000a0;mg, metronidazole 500&#x000a0;mg and clarithromycin 250&#x000a0;mg (OMC) or placebo therapy twice daily for one week in a distinct stratum. All study personnel and participants were blinded to treatment assignment for the duration of the study. The study protocol was approved by research and medical ethics committees of all participating centres and all patients gave written informed consent.</p><p>At the 2-week follow-up visit, unused study medication was returned and remaining tablets were counted in order to check compliance. Patients were considered to be noncompliant if &#x02264;6&#x000a0;days (85%) of study medication were used. Three months after baseline, and additionally if clinically indicated, patients underwent endoscopy of the upper gastrointestinal tract. A total of eight biopsies were taken during each endoscopy. Four samples, two from the antrum and two from the corpus were used for histology. All biopsies were stained with haematoxylin-eosin. The slides were scored independently by an experienced gastrointestinal pathologist and the investigator (HdL), blinded to treatment assignment and clinical data, according to the updated Sydney classification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In case of discrepant results, the specimen was discussed until agreement was reached. The remaining four biopsies were sent to a microbiological laboratory for culture and storage at &#x02013;70&#x000b0;C. A patient was considered <italic>H. pylori</italic>-negative when histology as well as culture was negative. All isolated strains were assessed for susceptibility to clarithromycin, metronidazole, tetracycline and amoxicillin at the central laboratory.</p><p>Both biopsy specimens of corpus and antrum were streaked on Columbia agar (CA) (Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD, USA) with 10% lysed horse blood (Bio Trading, Mijdrecht, the Netherlands), referred to as Columbia agar plates, and on CA with <italic>H. pylori</italic> selective supplement (Oxoid, Basingstoke, UK). Plates were incubated for 72&#x000a0;h at 37&#x000b0;C in a micro-aerophilic atmosphere (5% O<sub>2</sub>, 10% CO<sub>2</sub>, 85% N<sub>2</sub>). Identification was carried out by Gram&#x02019;s stain morphology, catalase, oxidase, and urea hydrolysis measurements.</p><p>Inocula were prepared from an <italic>H. pylori</italic> culture grown on CA plates. MICs of metronidazole, clarithromycin, tetracycline and amoxicillin were determined by E-test (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden) on CA plates essentially as described by Glupczynski et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. CA plates were inoculated with a bacterial suspension with a turbidity of a 3 McFarland standard (2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>8</sup> CFU/mL ). CLSI (tentative) breakpoints 2009 for susceptibility (S) and resistance (R) were applied (metronidazole MIC&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;8 mg/l (S) and &#x02265;16&#x000a0;mg/l (R), amoxicillin MIC&#x000a0;&#x02264;&#x000a0;0.5&#x000a0;mg/l (S) and&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;mg/l (R); tetracycline MIC &#x02264;&#x000a0;2&#x000a0;mg/l (S) and&#x000a0;&#x02265;&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;mg/l (R), and clarithromycin MIC &#x02264;&#x000a0;0.25&#x000a0;mg/l (S) and &#x02265;&#x000a0;1&#x000a0;mg/l (R)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Measurements with a Gaussian distribution were expressed at baseline as mean and SD, and measures with a non-Gaussian distribution were expressed as the median and interquartile range (IQR; expressed as the net result of 75th percentile&#x02013;25th percentile).

SPSS software (version 17.0.0) was used to perform these analyses. Differences in the proportions of patients with susceptible and resistant <italic>H. pylori</italic> strains and for compliant and non-compliant patients were analyzed with 95% confidence interval using the Confidence Interval Analysis (CIA) software for Windows (version 2.2.0).

Anti-<italic>H. pylori</italic> IgG antibodies were present in all patients (median titre 1689 [IQR 700-3732]). The treatment groups were similar in terms of demographic, rheumatic disease, NSAID and other drug use. Our eligibility criteria resulted in a study group with mainly inflammatory rheumatic diseases (rheumatoid arthritis 61%, spondylarthropathy 8%, psoriatic arthritis 7%, osteoarthritis 9%, other 15%). The most commonly used NSAIDs were diclofenac (29%), naproxen (18%), and ibuprofen (13%), most at full therapeutic doses (median relative daily dose 1 [IQR 0.5&#x02013;1]). The mean age was 60&#x000a0;years (SD 10), 61% was female. Twenty-two patients had a known allergy for amoxicillin and received metronidazole instead (10 patients) or placebo (12 patients).</p><p>Of these 347 patients, data on culture and histology of 304 patients were available (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>). In two cases only culture data were available and in one case only histology result was available; all three cases met the criteria for <italic>H. pylori</italic>-positivity and were found in the placebo group, but for clarity purposes were left out of Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>. A total of 32 patients (with no significant differences between eradication and placebo groups) refused the 3-month endoscopy, withdrew informed consent, or could not undergo endoscopy because of adverse events. Seven patients used anticoagulant therapy ruling out biopsy sampling according the protocol, and in one patient no biopsy specimens could be obtained because of discomfort requiring early completion of the procedure.

The main findings in the studied patient population were: (1) a 7-day PPI-triple eradication therapy either with clarithromycin or metronidazole was efficacious with eradication rates of 87% (95% CI 80&#x02013;91%) without prior testing for susceptibility of the infecting strain; (2) in 21% of the patients in the placebo group, the positive <italic>H. pylori</italic> serology test could not be confirmed by positive culture or histology; (3) compliance was an important factor for successful eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic>; and (4) prevalence of antibiotic resistance in <italic>H. pylori</italic> was low.</p><p>The main reason for not performing endoscopy at baseline was that this was not feasible in everyday rheumatology practice; therefore, serology was done to test for <italic>H. pylori</italic>. The reliability of serological kits for <italic>H. pylori</italic> infection has been widely confirmed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], contributing to the reputation of serology as a simple, minimally invasive and inexpensive diagnostic and screening test. The best available serology test at the time of the study was the Pyloriset&#x000ae; an EIA-G from Orion Diagnostica, Espoo, Finland, with a specificity of 79&#x02013;91% as assessed in previous studies in the Netherlands, including patients on acid suppressive therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. This specificity correlates well with our finding that in the placebo group, <italic>H. pylori</italic> could not be confirmed by culture or histology in 21% of the IgG positive patients. PPI usage (in this study 37% of the population) can result in false negative invasive and non-invasive diagnostic tests, such as culture, histology and 13-C urea breath, and should be stopped two weeks before testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. This does not apply for serology. 13-C urea breath tests have better accuracy (&#x0003e;90%), but the serology test used in this study was less expensive and in all study centres easily available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. On the other hand, we must not overlook that conditions during transport of biopsies are critical for successful isolation of <italic>H. pylori</italic>. Possibly, the antibacterial effect of NSAIDs, as has been suggested in in vitro studies, might also partly explain a false positive rate of serology of 21% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. However, in a randomized clinical trial of 122 patients, aspirin in combination with a standard 7-day course OAC eradication was not significantly different compared to the standard therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Based on culture and histology findings we conclude that one fifth of our patients were treated superfluously, with possible risk of side-effects of the eradication medication. Fortunately, both regimens were generally well tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Resistance to antibiotics in <italic>H. pylori</italic> is of particular concern because it is one of the major determinants in the failure of eradication regimens. Resistance rates for metronidazole and clarithromycin found in this study were similar as previously observed in other studies in the Netherlands in the years 1997&#x02013;98 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] and 1997&#x02013;2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. To our knowledge, there are no recent data available on <italic>H. pylori</italic> antibiotic primary resistance rates in the Netherlands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In addition, in this study, compliance played a crucial role in success of eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic>, i.e., treatment failure was as high as 50% in the non compliant group of patients. Possibly, the high number of tablets that has to be consumed during <italic>H. pylori</italic> eradication therapy is a contributing factor for non-compliance in this group of elderly patients who were also on other medications.</p><p>In conclusion, serology driven test and treat strategy eradication of <italic>H. pylori</italic> with a 7-day PPI-triple therapy is successful in the majority of patients. Success of eradication is, also in this group of rheumatology patients, to a great extent determined by compliance.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the nursing staff members, the medical staff members, and all other personnel who cooperated in this study of all contributing centres for their generous support and invaluable contribution.
