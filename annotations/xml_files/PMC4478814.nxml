In spite of its few adverse effects (mainly allergic reactions) during anesthesia, Postoperative recurarization always remain a risk following the use of neuromuscular blocking agents even for those with an intermediate duration of action.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] In addition, none of the commonly used reversal agents, such as neostigmine or edrophonium, are capable of reliably reversing profound blockade.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Side-effects may impede the use of higher doses of anticholinesterase agents. Consequently, a reversal agent with greater safety and efficacy that would lead to complete recovery and be able to reverse profound blockade will be of great advantage. The achievement of early recovery is targeted in neurosurgical cases in order to achieve early neurological evaluation and hence to hasten the diagnosis and treatment of a life-threatening complication.</p><p>Sugammadex (Bridionw, MSD, Oss, The Netherlands), a modified &#x003b3;-cyclodextrin, is a selective relaxant-binding agent which rapidly and completely reverses the effects of the neuromuscular blocking agent rocuronium[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] by encapsulating the muscle relaxant and rendering it inactive. It has been approved by the European Union since 2008 for the reversal of moderate and deep NMB induced by rocuronium.</p><p>The present comparative and randomized study investigated the use of sugammadex for reversing profound NMB in pediatric neurosurgical patients undergone posterior fossa tumor excision.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>Following Institutional Review Board approval and written informed consent, 40 pediatric patients were randomly enrolled in this study in the Children Cancer Hospital-Egypt (CCHE). The selected patients were American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III, aged 7-18 years, and undergoing scheduled, elective craniotomy for posterior fossa tumor excision. The criteria of exclusion were known allergies to any used anesthetic drug, mid-line shift, Glasgow Coma Scale &#x0003c;15, neuromuscular disorder; a history of malignant hyperthermia; significant renal dysfunction; if they were hemodynamically or neurologically unstable and/or refusal to sign the consent. In addition, patients who had been exposed to general anesthesia in the preceding 7 days before study were excluded. The tumor characteristics were assessed from the relevant preoperative magnetic resonance imaging.</p><p>Using a computer-generated randomization list, the patients were randomly allocated into one of two groups (20 patients each): Neostigmine group, and sugammadex group in which muscle relaxation was reversed at the end of surgery using neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg combined with atropine 0.02 mg/kg, or sugammadex 4 mg/kg solely, respectively.</p><p>All patients were sedated with midazolam (0.05 mg/kg IV) in the preoperative holding area, and then transferred to the operating theatre where they were preoxygenated with 100% oxygen for 3 min during which the noninvasive monitoring incorporated into the anesthesia work station (Zeus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Draeger, Luebeck, Germany) were applied. These monitors include pulse oximetry (SpO<sub>2</sub>), electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure, axillary temperature probe and peripheral nerve stimulator. Apart from the reversal of the muscle relaxant administered at recovery from anesthesia at the end of surgery, anesthesia was standardized to all patients. Induction of anesthesia was achieved intravenously using thiopental (6 mg/kg), fentanyl (2 &#x003bc;g/kg), and rocuronium bromide (0.6 mg/kg) to facilitate endotracheal intubation after the count of twitches of the train of four (TOF) stimulation reached 0-1 and was displayed digitally. Then, all patients were mechanically ventilated using fresh gas flow at 2 L/min with a mixture of air-oxygen (50% oxygen) using the anesthesia workstation (Zeus<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Dr&#x000e4;ger, Luebeck, Germany). Tidal volume was set at 8 ml/kg and respiratory frequency was adjusted in order to maintain an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> (EtCO<sub>2</sub>) between 30 and 35 mmHg. EtCO<sub>2</sub>, inspired and expired tidal volumes, airway pressure as well as oxygen and agent concentrations were continuously monitored. All data were recorded using electronic anesthesia record (Cerner Millennium software, USA).</p><p>Arterial catheter was inserted into the radial artery and connected to a transducer (Hemomed, Siemens, Germany) to monitor the invasive blood pressure throughout the anesthesia as well as postoperatively for the first 2 h. Muscle relaxation was monitored throughout the anesthesia by peripheral nerve stimulator (INFINITY TRIDENT, Dragger Medical Systems, Inc., USA) applied to the adductor pollicis using TOF mode targeting to keep the count of twitches of the TOF stimulation 0-1.</p><p>A local anesthetic of 1% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000 was infiltrated at the sites of fixation of Mayfield head holder into the patient's head and on the scalp over the surgical field. Maintenance of anesthesia was obtained using intravenous infusion of fentanyl at rate of 0.5 &#x003bc;g/kg/h, and rocuronium bromide at rate of 0.4 mg/kg/h together with sevoflurane starting at 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) and then subsequently adjusted to maintain mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) within a range of 20% of preanesthesia level. MAC of sevoflurane was recorded by the anesthetic machine in real-time for MAC-hour calculation which is the average MAC length of exposure.</p><p>Persistent relative hypertension or tachycardia episodes lasting &#x0003e;1 min (defined as MAP or HR rises &#x0003e;20% of baseline value) not responding to the maximal allowed anesthetic concentration were treated with labetalol 0.5 mg/kg intravenous bolus.</p><p>Episodes of hypotension (MAP &#x0003c;20% of the baseline value) not responding to intra-operative fluid replacement could be managed with vasopressor (ephedrine 0.2 mg/kg IV). Bradycardia (HR &#x0003c;20% of the baseline value) and lasting &#x0003e;1 min were treated with atropine sulfate 0.02 mg/kg IV.</p><p>Arterial blood samples for gas analysis were collected every hour during the anesthesia as well as postoperatively for the first 2 h to monitor oxygen and carbon dioxide tensions as well as blood sodium and potassium levels.</p><p>Intra-operative normothermia was actively maintained with a forced air warming system (Bair Hugger) and continuous monitoring of body temperature using axillary temperature probe.</p><p>During securing the bone flap, the rocuronium and fentanyl infusion were discontinued. At the end of surgery, after skin closure and detachment of Mayfield head holder from the patient, the inhalational anesthetics were discontinued. When the TOF count reached 2, the residual muscle relaxation was antagonized with neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg IV and atropine 0.02 mg/kg IV for patients in neostigmine group or with sugammadex 4 mg/kg alone for patients in sugammadex group. Vital signs (blood pressure and HR) were measured at screening, before administration of rocuronium, immediately before and then at 2, 5, 10 and 15 min after administration of the used neuromuscular blocking agent as well as 24 h postoperatively.</p><p>Patients were extubated when respiratory function was adequate (as indicated by adequate respiratory rate according to the age; tidal volume &#x0003e;4 ml/kg; SpO<sub>2</sub> continued maintained above 95% on FiO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003c;60%), hemodynamics were stable and upper airway reflexes were fully recovered.</p><p>Patients then were transferred into the Neurosurgical Intensive Care Unit (NSICU) where they received paracetamol (Perfalgan) 10 mg/kg IV as well as supplemental oxygen at a flow rate of 6-8 L/min (fraction of inspired oxygen 40%) throughout the period of observation.</p><p>Upon arrival to NSICU, pulse oximetry and respiratory rate were measured for at least 60 min to assess the adequacy of spontaneous ventilation.</p><p>Any other adverse effects elicited during the procedure or in the NSICU were recorded along with its time of occurrence, severity, and duration.</p><p>Three blood samples (3 ml each) were collected from each patient for safety assessment to measure hematocrit, blood count, liver and kidney enzymes just before administration of muscle relaxant at induction of anesthesia, at stopping of rocuronium and at 24 h postoperative.</p><p>The primary study endpoint was the time from the administration of sugammadex or neostigmine to recovery of the TOF ratio to 90% after rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.</p><p>Intraoperative HR and MAP during administration of reversal agents were considered as secondary endpoints as well any incidence of adverse events in the first 24 h after surgery.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Previous studies on efficacy of sugammadex for the reversal of the block induced by rocuronium were based on recovery of TOFR.

Hence, 19 patients in each group were required to detect at least 5 min difference or more in this variable between groups and to be able to reject the null hypothesis, which the population means of each group are equal with probability (power) 0.85. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis (&#x003b1;) is 0.05.

The use of sugammadex also averted the need for the anticholinergic drugs atropine.</p><p>It is well established that neostigmine provides slow recovery when administered for reversal of profound neuromuscular block.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>The sugammadex at dose of 4 mg/kg reversed the neuromuscular block and the TOF reached 90% in a mean of 1.4 min which was 18 folds faster than that achieved by the neostigmine at the dose of 40 &#x003bc;g/kg combined with atropine 0.02 mg/kg.</p><p>These results come in agreement with the results observed by Sorgenfrei <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] who demonstrated that sugammadex allowed return of the TOF ratio to 90% within 5 min when administered to reverse a moderately profound rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.</p><p>This prompt and smooth reversal of the neuromuscular block appears to have important clinical implications during prolonged surgeries particularly the neurosurgery that require maintenance of deep NMB throughout the procedure followed by rapid recovery to allow early neurological evaluation of the patient after neurosurgery and hence to hasten the diagnosis and treatment of a life-threatening complication.</p><p>In the current study, we selected the dose 4 mg/kg for sugammadex according to phase II dose-ranging studies[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and the dose of neostigmine and atropine were administered based on the standard recommended doses.</p><p>The results in our study support the findings of previous studies that concluded that sugammadex provides fast and safe recovery from rocuronium-induced neuromuscular block.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>In a randomized study by Groudine <italic>et al</italic>., the mean times for the TOF ratio to reach 90% after 4 mg/kg sugammadex for reversal of rocuronium at 0.6 or 1.2 mg/kg were 3.3 and 1.9 min, respectively which come in agreement with our findings.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Furthermore, Sacan <italic>et al</italic>. found that sugammadex at 4 mg/kg reversed rocuronium-induced NMB (by reaching TOF ration to 90%) by 10 folds faster than that achieved by neostigmine combined with glycopyrrolate.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>It is worthy to mention that the reversal of muscle relaxation in our study was sustained without any evidence of recurarization in any patient in both groups during the period of neuromuscular monitoring or during their stay in the postanesthetic neurosurgical care unit.</p><p>The mean recovery times were similar to that previously found with Shields <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] when they administered Org 25,969 at recovery of T2 following at least 2 h of neuromuscular block by rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg as an initial dose followed by increments to maintain a deep block. Thus, the effective dose of sugammadex seems to be independent of whether the rocuronium was administered in several maintenance doses or continuous infusion.</p><p>The patients in sugammadex group remained stable regarding the MAP and HR during the entire observation time during and after reversal in contrast to those patients in the neostigmine group who demonstrated significant rise in MAP and HR values in the first 10 min after administration of the reversal drugs when administered at the end of the steady state anesthesia in our study and this augment the results of Sacan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</p><p>In the first 10 min after reversal with neostigmine and atropine but not after sugammadex there were significant higher HR and arterial pressure than the preinduction level although, this did not exceed the 20% beyond the baseline.</p><p>As sugammadex binds the rocuronium molecules in a 1:1 ratio[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] without having an effect on the plasma cholinesterase or on any muscarinic receptor in the human body,[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] no muscarinic effects results from its use. Such effects are responsible for the side-effects observed with the use of anticholinesterase agents combined with anticholinergic drug (atropine). Atropine may produce the undesirable tachycardia and/or arrhythmias.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The absence of muscarinic and cardiovascular effects at the time of reversal will be of great advantage especially in patients with cardiovascular and respiratory disease.</p><p>Sugammadex was well tolerated and confirmed in previous clinical studies. Peeters <italic>et al</italic>. concluded in a randomized double-blind crossover and placebo-controlled study that sugammadex is highly safe drugs with few adverse effects. In the phase I clinical study, a high intravenous dose of 96 mg/kg when administered into human subjects, showed taste disturbance as characteristic adverse reaction.[<xref rid="ref17"
