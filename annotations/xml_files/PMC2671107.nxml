Progression to type 2 diabetes results from impaired insulin sensitivity and pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) may decrease diabetes in high-risk individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). These agents can improve insulin sensitivity by preventing inhibitory effects of angiotensin II on GLUT4 translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) or improve insulin secretion by preventing angiotensin II type 1 receptor&#x02013;dependent inhibition of insulin release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>).</p><p>Nitric oxide (NO) may also contribute to salutary effects of ACEIs and ARBs on glucose homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). NO stimulates muscle glucose uptake through cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). In mice, inhibiting cGMP degradation by phosphodiesterase 5 increases insulin sensitivity and muscle glucose uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). cGMP decreases apoptosis and increases intracellular calcium in pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells, suggesting an insulinotropic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). We tested the hypothesis that decreasing degradation of cGMP would enhance any effect of ACE inhibition on insulin sensitivity or &#x003b2;-cell function in humans.</p><sec><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Subjects with metabolic syndrome (National Cholesterol Education Program criteria) participated in a double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled crossover study.</p><p>Each subject was studied four times (see supplementary Fig. A1, available in an online appendix at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc08-1862/DC1">http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/dc08-1862/DC1</ext-link>). Antihypertensive medications were withdrawn 3 weeks before the study. Participants were then randomized to one of four 3-week treatments (placebo plus placebo, ramipril [10 mg/day] plus placebo, tadalafil [10 mg o.d.] plus placebo, and ramipril plus tadalafil) separated by a 1-week washout period.</p><p>During the last week of treatment, subjects ate a nitrate-, sodium-, and calorie-controlled diet. On the last day, they collected a 24-h urine sample and fasted overnight. At 0730 h, supine blood pressure and heart rate were measured thrice, 2 min apart. Blood was drawn via venous catheter for plasma renin activity (PRA), ACE activity, angiotensin II, aldosterone, fibrinolytic parameters, NO metabolites, <sc>l</sc>-citrulline, <sc>l</sc>-arginine, and cGMP.</p><p>At 0800 h, subjects underwent a frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (additional information available in the online appendix). Insulin sensitivity index, glucose effectiveness index, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance, and &#x003b2;-cell function were calculated using a modified version of minimal model (MINMOD) formulas. Acute insulin response to glucose (AIR<sub>g</sub>) was assessed from the area under the insulin curve for the first 10 min following dextrose infusion. Because AIR<sub>g</sub> disregards changes in insulin sensitivity, we used disposition index, calculated from insulin sensitivity and AIR<sub>g</sub>, as a more reliable indicator of &#x003b2;-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Eighteen subjects completed the study. Characteristics can be found in supplementary Tables A1 and A2.</p><sec><title>Hemodynamic and renin-angiotensin effects</title><p>Sodium excretion was similar during all treatments (supplementary Table A3). Ramipril significantly increased PRA and decreased ACE activity and angiotensin II (supplementary Table A3). Tadalafil did not affect the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system or alter effects of ramipril.</p><p>Ramipril reduced systolic (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>) and diastolic blood pressure (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).

In a subgroup analysis, tadalafil improved &#x003b2;-cell function in women (154.4 &#x000b1; 48.0, 331.9 &#x000b1; 209.3, 229.1 &#x000b1; 202.1, and 259.7 &#x000b1; 95.8 &#x003bc; &#x000b7; mmol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> during placebo, tadalafil, ramipril, and ramipril plus tadalafil treatment, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.01 for tadalafil effect) but not in men. There was a trend toward improved &#x003b2;-cell function during tadalafil treatment in individuals with baseline fasting hyperglycemia (195.3 &#x000b1; 103.1, 278.7 &#x000b1; 114.0, 157.2 &#x000b1; 52.6, and 210.6 &#x000b1; 72.3 &#x003bc; &#x000b7; mmol<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> &#x000b7; l<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> during placebo, tadalafil, ramipril, and ramipril plus tadalafil treatment, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.06 for tadalafil) but not in subjects with normal fasting glucose. There was no effect of race and no interactive effect of ramipril or tadalafil on &#x003b2;-cell function.</p><p>Ramipril (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) and tadalafil (<italic>P</italic> = 0.02) improved the disposition index in women but not in men after controlling for fasting glucose. This was attributable to a synergistic effect of ramipril and tadalafil on the disposition index (1,001.8 &#x000b1; 909.5, 977.8 &#x000b1; 728.5, 1,308.8 &#x000b1; 976.2, and 1,982.2 &#x000b1; 1,982.2 units during placebo, tadalafil, ramipril, and ramipril plus tadalafil, respectively; <italic>P</italic> = 0.05 for ramipril plus tadalafil).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>The phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor tadalafil, alone or in combination with ramipril, improved basal and glucose-stimulated &#x003b2;-cell function. The latter effect was independent of insulin sensitivity, as indicated by improvement in the disposition index (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Metabolic syndrome, an insulin-resistant state, frequently progresses to type 2 diabetes. Loss of &#x003b2;-cell function and impaired insulin sensitivity both contribute to the development of diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). &#x003b2;-Cell dysfunction may play a greater role than previously appreciated in that pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis precedes overt diabetes in high-risk individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>) and surgical reduction of pancreatic mass causes impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, no prior human or animal studies have reported an effect of phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition on &#x003b2;-cell function. Pancreatic &#x003b2;-cells express endothelial NO synthase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Previous studies provide conflicting data, however, regarding the effect of NO on &#x003b2;-cell function, with some suggesting that NO suppresses insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>) and others indicating that NO enhances insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>Tadalafil improved islet cell function in women studied but not in men. A higher frequency of fasting hyperglycemia among women with metabolic syndrome may have confounded this sex difference. Alternatively, women may be more sensitive than men to decreased cGMP degradation. In support of this possibility, three of six women studied, but no men, reported muscle aches during tadalafil treatment.</p><p>ACEIs improve glucose homeostasis or decrease diabetes incidence in clinical trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). Although ACEIs and ARBs improve glucose uptake and/or insulin secretion in vitro and in rodents, studies in humans provide mixed data regarding their effects on insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>). We did not detect an effect of ramipril on insulin sensitivity or &#x003b2;-cell function but did detect an effect of ramipril on disposition index in women. Tadalafil enhanced this effect, again suggesting cGMP-dependent improvement in insulin secretion.</p><p>Tadalafil improves &#x003b2;-cell function in metabolic syndrome. Studies are needed to determine whether the effect of tadalafil is limited to women or related to the magnitude of hyperglycemia. Given the increasing role attributed to &#x003b2;-cell dysfunction in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes, these data suggest a novel therapeutic intervention in a high-risk population.</p></sec>
