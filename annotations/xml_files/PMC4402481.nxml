Forty-six individuals (24 children and 22 adults) were assigned to four groups: trained adolescents, (TAD, <italic>N</italic> = 13), untrained adolescents (UAD, <italic>N</italic> = 11), trained adults (TA, <italic>N</italic> = 12), and untrained adults (UA, <italic>N</italic> = 10). Aerobic capacity and redox status related variables [total antioxidant capacity (TAC), glutathione (GSH), catalase activity, TBARS, protein carbonyls (PC), uric acid, and bilirubin] were assessed at rest and in response to a time-trial bout before training, at mid- and posttraining. TAC, catalase activity, TBARS, PC, uric acid, and bilirubin increased and GSH declined in all groups in response to acute exercise independent of training status and age. Training improved aerobic capacity, TAC, and GSH at rest and in response to exercise. Age affected basal and exercise-induced responses since adults demonstrated a greater TAC and GSH levels at rest and a greater rise of TBARS, protein carbonyls, and TAC and decline of GSH in response to exercise. Catalase activity, uric acid, and bilirubin responses were comparable among groups. These results suggest that acute exercise, age, and training modulate the antioxidant reserves of the body.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Strenuous exercise increases oxygen consumption in the working muscles by 100- to 200-fold above resting levels resulting in a marked rise of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (RONS) formation [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Several molecular mechanisms contribute to RONS release during exercise [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] which in turn activate enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants against RONS [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. When RONS production overrides antioxidant defence oxidative stress develops in a tissue-specific manner, thereby altering cellular redox status [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Redox status perturbations appear to be essential for regulation of redox-sensitive intracellular signalling pathways, mediating exercise-induced inflammatory responses and skeletal muscle regeneration [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Puberty is a period during which rapid growth, development of sexual characteristics, and reproductive competence occur [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] due to upregulation of anabolic and other hormones [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. It is uncertain whether puberty interferes with antioxidant activity of adolescents. A reduction of antioxidant activity observed in response to growth hormone deficiency in adolescents was reversed following growth hormone replacement treatment [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, testosterone was able to inhibit<italic> in vitro</italic> neutrophil prooxidative capability [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] and in Japanese adolescents was negatively correlated with oxidative stress indices [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. These findings and data from other investigations suggest that puberty tends to upregulate antioxidant system [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Intense exercise induces an inflammatory response and is associated with increased oxidative stress and antioxidant activity [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Previous research has reported both increases and reductions of oxidative stress markers and antioxidant status indices in children and adolescents in response to intense exercise [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Differences in exercise mode may partly explain these discrepancies (weight-bearing activities versus swimming). Although adolescents develop an inflammatory response to exercise like adults [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] that leads to increased oxidative stress markers and antioxidant activity, one should be very cautious in extrapolating data derived from adult literature to children or adolescents. Younger individuals exhibit more rapid VO<sub>2</sub> kinetics, which is in accordance with the concept that children and adolescents are more aerobic, with a greater mitochondrial capacity for oxidative phosphorylation and less anaerobic than adults during exercise [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. These characteristics in children increase the likelihood to generate more RONS in response to exercise than adults [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. If this hypothesis is correct, then exercise should also elicit a marked antioxidant response. Available data on the effects of acute exercise on antioxidant activity of adolescents is scarce. Intense prolonged running left total antioxidant capacity reduced glutathione and antioxidant enzymes unaffected [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas vigorous swimming upregulated antioxidant activity in adolescents [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>RONS regulate exercise-induced physiological adaptations such as mitochondrial biogenesis, management of cellular stress by mediating several intracellular signaling pathways (e.g., NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B pathway, cytokine expressions pathways) [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Although we know that exercise training upregulates antioxidant potential in adults and aged individuals [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], very limited information exists for adolescents and children. According to the theory of hormesis acute increases of RONS in response to single exercise sessions precondition skeletal muscle and other tissues by adapting their redox status to these multiple oxidative challenges and chronically elevate their antioxidant defense mechanisms [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. However, this theory has not been documented in adolescents yet, since the few studies conducted so far have produced contradictory results. Prolonged intense training with long-distance running in adolescents did not increase basal antioxidant activity [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], whereas swimming training did [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Thus, the purpose of this investigation was (i) to determine whether a running training macrocycle affects basal oxidative stress development and antioxidant status during early puberty and (ii) to examine if adults and adolescents demonstrate similar or different redox status adaptations to equal volumes of running training. Results from the present study indicate that acute exercise, age, and training modulate the antioxidant reserves of the body.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Thirty adults and 30 adolescents volunteered to participate in the study. Selection criteria included (a) the fact that control subjects (adults and adolescents) should not be involved in organized sports, (b) absence of musculoskeletal and/or other health problems, (c) no use of nutritional supplements and medications before (&#x02265;6 months) and during the study, (d) the fact that participants were nonsmokers, and (e) the fact that adolescents were at Tanner stages 2-3 of pubertal development throughout the study. Eight adults and adolescents were excluded from the study due to failure to comply with the inclusion criteria. Accordingly, 22 adults (19 men and 3 women) and 24 adolescents (19 boys and 5 girls) completed the study. The anthropometric, physiological, and training characteristics of participants are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. Adult participants and adolescent participants' parents/guardians signed a voluntary consent. The procedures were conformed to the Helsinki declaration of 1975 and were approved by the Human Subjects Committee of the local University (Ref#:66/10-4-2008).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Experimental Design</title><p>In order to determine redox status changes of adolescent long-distance runners during an 11-month (September through July), two-peaked, training macrocycle and compare them to corresponding changes of adult long-distance runners following the same training regimen, a four-group, repeated measures design was employed. Two control groups were used to control seasonal variations of dependent variables. Participants were assigned to one of the following groups: (a) control adolescents (UAD, <italic>N</italic> = 11, did not participate in training), (b) trained adolescents (TAD, <italic>N</italic> = 13, participated in training), (c) control adults (UA, <italic>N</italic> = 10, did not participate in training), and (d) trained adults (TA, <italic>N</italic> = 12, participated in training). UAD and UA abstained from any structured training program (except for activities performed at school during Physical Education classes for UAD) and were involved only in recreational sports. During their initial visit to the laboratory (end of August), participants had their anthropometric profile (body mass, height, and body composition), stage of sexual maturity (adolescents only), and maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>) measured. In a second visit (5 days later), participants in all groups performed a time-trial test to exhaustion while blood was collected at pre- and posttest as well as at one hour (h) of recovery. These measurements were repeated following the conclusion of each competitive period (end of February and mid-July) in exactly the same order. All measurements and blood sampling at mid- and end-season were performed seven days after the last training session.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Training</title><p>Training followed the annual periodization plan for long-distance runners and followed an individualized program that consisted of two competitive periods. Participants started following a 6-week off-season period (mid-July&#x02013;end of August) consisting of minimal training. Adults and adolescent athletes followed similar programs consisting mainly of continuous (65&#x02013;85% VO<sub>2max</sub>) or interval aerobic running. Training regimens were supplemented periodically with speed training (one session/week) and strength training with resistance exercises once or twice a week. The macrocycle consisted of a first preparatory phase (September to mid-January), a first tapering phase (the second part of January), a first competitive phase (February) that included 5 races for the TA group and 4 races for the TAD group, a second preparatory phase (March to May), a second tapering phase (first half of June), and a second competitive phase (second part of June and July) that included 8 races for the TA group and 6 races for the TAD group. Average weekly training volume, intensity, and frequency of the training macrocycle are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Running intensity was monitored by telemetry (Polar, Electro Oy, Finland).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Exercise Testing</title><p>During exercise testing, participants ran for 45&#x02009;min on a treadmill at intensity equal to ~75% of their VO<sub>2max</sub>. Thereafter, intensity (speed) increased to 90% VO<sub>2max</sub> and participants ran until volitional fatigue. This test has been shown to induce a marked elevation of oxidative stress [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Participants had access to water ad libitum during testing. Heart rate, VO<sub>2</sub>, and ratings of exertion on a Borg scale (6&#x02013;20) were monitored throughout testing.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Measurements</title><p>All measurements took place in the morning (08.00&#x02013;10.00&#x02009;a.m.). Female participants were tested during the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle (days 2&#x02013;8) to minimize variance in estrogen levels [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Body mass was measured to the nearest 0.5&#x02009;kg with subjects lightly dressed and barefoot (Beam Balance 710, Seca, UK, Serial #: 940298) and standing height was measured to the nearest 0.5&#x02009;cm (Stadiometer 208, Seca, UK, Serial #: 940298). Percentage body fat was calculated from 7 skinfold measures (average of 2 measurements at each site), using a Harpenden caliper (John Bull, St. Albans, UK). Maximal oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2max</sub>) was determined using a treadmill test to exhaustion. The protocol began at 7&#x02013;10&#x02009;km&#x000b7;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (0% slope) and progressed by 0.5&#x02009;km and increased each minute until VO<sub>2max</sub> was reached. Criteria used to determine VO<sub>2max</sub> were (i) subjects' exhaustion, (ii) a &#x0003c;2&#x02009;mL&#x000b7;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x000b7;min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> increase in VO<sub>2</sub> with an increase in work rate, (iii) a respiratory exchange ratio greater than or equal to 1.10, and (iv) a heart rate within 10&#x02009;bpm of the theoretical maximum heart rate (220 - age). Respiratory gas variables were measured using a metabolic cart (Vmax29, Sensormedics, USA, Serial #: 00363), which was calibrated before each test using standard gases of known concentration. Exercise heart rate was monitored by telemetry (Polar Tester S610TM, Electro Oy, Finland, Serial #: 190030907). Finally, the velocity at maximal oxygen consumption (vVO<sub>2max</sub>) and the velocity at anaerobic threshold (vTh) were recorded. The vTh was determined by the V-slope method [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] while vVO<sub>2max</sub> was defined according to Billat et al.

For GSH measurement [<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], erythrocyte lysates (20&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L) were treated with 5% TCA mixed with sodium potassium phosphate (660&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L, 67&#x02009;mM, pH 8.0) and 5,5&#x02032;-dithiobis-2 nitrobenzoate (330&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>L, 1&#x02009;mM). Samples were then incubated (in the dark, room temperature, 45&#x02009;min) and their absorbance was measured at 412&#x02009;nm. Catalase activity was measured as described by Aebi [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Hb was determined with a commercially available kit (Dutch Diagnostics BV, Netherlands). Bilirubin and uric acid were measured in a Clinical Chemistry Analyzer Z 1145 (Zafiropoulos Diagnostica, Athens, Greece, Serial #: 52079) with commercially available kits (Zafiropoulos, Athens, Greece). Each variable was analyzed in duplicate on the same day. Inter- and intra-assay coefficients of variation for all assays ranged from 2.4% to 6.8% and from 2.8% to 7.1%, respectively.

Discussion</title><p>The present investigation examined resting and exercise-induced responses in redox status markers in adolescents and adults participating in a year-long running training season. Results indicate that (i) independent of training status both adolescents and adults demonstrate an elevation of oxidative stress and antioxidant status markers in response to acute exercise stress, (ii) independent of training status, adults demonstrated a higher TAC and GSH at rest and a greater change of these two antioxidant status markers after acute exercise, and (iii) untrained adults and adolescents may have a lower antioxidant reserve than their trained counterparts.</p><p>A marked improvement of aerobic capacity was noted in all trained participants (independent of age), since VO<sub>2max</sub>, vVO<sub>2max</sub>, and the vAT increased markedly in response to prolonged training. These results are in agreement with previous studies reporting similar changes for both adolescent [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] and adult [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] athletes.</p><sec id="sec4.1"><title>4.1. Responses to Acute Exercise</title><p>It appears that children and adults responded to acute exercise by increasing considerably their TBARS and protein carbonyl levels for 1&#x02009;h after exercise independent of training status. This is in accordance with a number of studies that showed an elevation of oxidative stress markers in children, adolescents, and adult humans in response to various exercise protocols and modes [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Our results and those of others suggest that children and/or adolescent may respond, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to acute submaximal exercise stress similarly to adults [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>].</p><p>The elevation of oxidative stress markers immediately after exercise may be attributed to the substantial elevation of oxygen processing by the respiratory chain of mitochondria of both adolescent and adult participants in response to our time-trial bout [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. The time-frame of these responses was similar to that reported for adults using a similar exercise protocol, that is, an elevation of approximately one hour long [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The rise of oxidative stress markers 1&#x02009;h after exercise may be attributed to either an activation of signaling pathways to enhance antioxidant activity or extramitochondrial pathways of ROS production, such as those of myeloperoxidase and elastase (generate superoxide) of circulating leukocytes (i.e., neutrophils), which are recruited and migrated to the injured skeletal muscles [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The exercise-induced rise of neutrophils persists for approximately an hour, during which mitochondrial oxygen processing has reached baseline levels again [<xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Although evidence suggests that children may exhibit a different immune response to a physical challenge [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>], exercise-induced neutrophilia has been observed in both adults and children [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Acute exercise increased TAC and reduced GSH independent of age and training status suggesting a recruitment of antioxidant resources to offset the elevated oxidative stress. Similar findings have been reported by Nikolaidis et al. [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] for prepubescent boys and girls in response to intense swimming protocols as well as in response to other exercise modalities such as basketball [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and soccer [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. The erythrocyte GSH decline reveals a potential increased utilization of this antioxidant as a result of exercise-induced RONS. A similar effect has been shown in male and female swimmers [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. These findings are also in agreement with similar GSH reductions after endurance, dynamic, or interval exercise [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>Exercise also elicited a marked rise of uric acid in all groups probably due to augmented adenine breakdown during exercise. This finding coincides with the observation of increased oxidative stress, as evidenced by the elevated TBARS and protein carbonyls, also suggesting increased ROS generation [<xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. Furthermore, uric acid elevation may have enhanced TAC response to exercise or during recovery [<xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], since it has been shown to account for approximately 30% of TAC upregulation [<xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In fact, uric acid elevation paralleled that of TAC after exercise in this study.</p><p>In agreement with previous reports [<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="B48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], bilirubin increased after exercise probably due to increased haemolysis on account of repeated foot striking on the ground during running [<xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. This bilirubin increase may also have contributed to TAC upregulation [<xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><title>4.2. Age Effects</title><p>There are only a limited number of studies that compared exercise-induced oxidative stress and antioxidant status responses between adults and adolescents. Previous research has suggested that children and adolescents may release more ROS in response to exercise than adults due to their faster VO<sub>2</sub> kinetics [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, this was not the case in this study since adults exhibited a greater oxidative stress and antioxidant response to exercise than adolescents. In one of the few studies, Timmons et al. [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] directly compared oxidative stress adaptations in children and young adult males in response to acute cycling exercise of moderate intensity (60&#x02013;70% of maximal aerobic power). Although, in that study, there were no differences in basal levels of protein carbonyls, a lower response was observed in children than men after exercise due to a blunted cytokine and immune response to exercise in children.</p><p>Adults demonstrated also a greater TAC rise and GSH decline than their adolescent counterparts in response to exercise suggesting that they performed a greater exercise overload (volume and intensity). GSH levels may be different between adolescents and adults with higher concentrations being observed in adults [<xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Furthermore, lower CoQ redox ratio (ubiquinol/ubiquinone) was observed in children suggesting an age effect on redox status [<xref rid="B52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. This age-dependent upregulation of GSH and redox status warrants further investigation. Nevertheless there are reports in the literature suggesting a more pronounced [<xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>] or insignificant response [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] of antioxidant status markers compared to adults during or after exercise. Variations in age, conditioning status, exercise protocols and modalities, and control of antioxidant nutritional intake among studies may explain these discrepancies.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3"><title>4.3. Training Effects</title><p>There is a plethora of evidence suggesting that regular physical activity or training upregulates activity of antioxidant enzymes and DNA repair enzymes in young adults as well as in the elderly at rest or in response to exercise stress [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although there were no differences in basal oxidative stress levels, as evidenced by TBARS and protein carbonyl levels, between trained and untrained participants, the former demonstrated a greater TAC and GSH levels at rest and in response to acute exercise. GSH is the most important thiol in the human body and acts as a substrate for glutathione peroxidase in peroxidase ROS inhibition [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and can directly detoxify ROS and enhances the functional antioxidant capacity of vitamins C and E [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Indeed, systematic exercise training elevates GSH concentration and the activity of GSH-dependent enzymes [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. In an elegant work, Kihlstrom [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>] showed that the enhanced capacity of the rat myocardium to detoxify ROS following swimming training is mainly attributed to the training-induced elevation of GSH, reduction of GSSG reductase activity, and rise of the activity of thioredoxin reductase. Similar findings were obtained by animal training studies that used running as the exercise mode [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. However, evidence of training-induced effects on oxidative stress and antioxidant status markers in adolescents is scarce.</p><p>A major finding of this study is the greater TAC and GSH reserves in trained adolescents as compared to their sedentary counterparts. This TAC and GSH response to training was similar to that observed in adult populations. This training effect was more pronounced after the second part of training (midtraining), a finding that may be explained by the greater training overload adapted during that period which plays a crucial role in the enhancement of the antioxidant defense system [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Similar TAC increases have been seen in response to a rugby season characterized by periodized fluctuations in training load [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. Since uric acid represents at least one-third of exercise-induced rise in TAC [<xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>] one would expect to see a training-induced increase of uric acid. Even though others observed a training-induced rise of uric acid in blood and in muscle of adult subjects [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>], such adaptation was not seen in this study. Possibly, other nonenzymatic water soluble antioxidants that were not assessed in this study (i.e., ascorbic acid) may have contributed to the increase in TAC due to training.</p><p>Similar GSH adaptations have been obtained in response to low (17&#x02013;43&#x02009;km&#x000b7;week<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and high (80&#x02013;147&#x02009;km&#x000b7;week<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) training running volume [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Kabasakalis et al. [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] failed to observe a similar effect on TAC in response to prolonged swimming training. However, no details of the training regime (i.e., intensity, training load, etc.) that was followed throughout the year were given in that study. Furthermore, no significant differences have been reported between elite adolescent swimmers and moderately trained ones [<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>]. The discrepancies between those two studies and the present investigation may be related to the conditioning status of participants (elite runners versus moderately trained) and exercise training mode (running versus swimming). In contrast, Gougoura et al. [<xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] showed that trained children had lower GSH levels and antioxidant capacity in blood than untrained ones. However, direct comparison of that study may not be feasible due to differences in participants' age.</p><p>Catalase activity remained unaltered by training in this study. Similar findings were reported by others after four and 13&#x02013;23 weeks of training [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. In contrast to these studies, lower catalase levels were found in trained adolescents when compared to untrained age-matched controls [<xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. On the other hand, cross-sectional studies revealed a greater catalase activity in adult trained distance runners [<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>] and cyclists [<xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>] compared to untrained individuals. Similar findings have been obtained by training studies [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>]. Differences in type of training modality, age, training level, and duration of study, as well as nutritional status of the participants, can largely account for these discrepancies. Further investigation is needed in order to elucidate how training affects antioxidant enzymes in the adolescent population.</p><p>Trained adolescents demonstrated similar basal levels and greater exercise-induced responses of TBARS and protein carbonyls. In contrast to our results, cross-sectional studies have reported both lower [<xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>] and higher basal lipid peroxidation levels for trained children, adolescents, and adults compared to untrained ones [<xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>]. Cavas and Tarhan [<xref rid="B65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>] reported higher lipid peroxidation following a 4-week swimming training regardless of an increase in several antioxidant parameters (superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione). On the other hand, lower protein carbonyls have been reported following training in adults [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Differences in research designs as well as in the time of sampling may explain these discrepancies. The greater level of oxidative stress markers in trained participants following exercise may be attributed to the greater exercise load obtained during exercise testing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In summary, aerobic training appears to cause an improvement of the antioxidant system in adolescents in a fashion similar to that seen in adults. Likewise, age may also be a determinant factor of oxidative stress and antioxidant status adaptations at rest and in response to exercise. Proper training program development and implementation could lead to an upregulation of some components of the antioxidant defense system or reserve and further studies are needed to delineate the effects of chronic training on redox status of adolescents.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>This study was supported by a grant received by Bodosakis Foundation (Greece) for instrument purchase and Grant funding CE-80739.</p></ack><sec sec-type="conflict"><title>Conflict of Interests</title><p>The authors declare that there is no conflict of interests regarding the publication of this paper.</p></sec><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>L.
