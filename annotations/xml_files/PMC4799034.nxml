The prevalence of sensitive skin in the general population is over 60% in both males and females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the general population, over 50% have suffered sensitive skin for over 5&#x000a0;years, and more than 42% have over a 10-year history of sensitive skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. In over 30% of this population their sensitive skin worsened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The prevalence rate is higher in African-American than in Caucasians, particularly in the genital area [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. On the face and genital area, females have a higher prevalence than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Sensitive skin can be caused by a variety of external and internal factors, including sun exposure, psychological stress, wind and hot or cold weather conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Among these factors, use of cosmetic products is the most common cause [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. For example, use of inappropriate washing emulsion can elevate both skin surface pH and transepidermal water loss (TEWL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] which in turn can induce or exacerbate cutaneous inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Certain dermatoses, such as atopic dermatitis, are associated with sensitive skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>The prevention and treatment of sensitive skin have been a challenge for both patients and clinicians due to its uncertain etiology and pathogenesis. However, sensitive skin features a number of abnormalities in its biophysical properties, including increased TEWL and skin erythema index, reduced stratum hydration (SC), and compromised SC integrity. Cho et al. did, however, show no difference in TEWL between sensitive skin and normal skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Moreover, a marked elevation in both skin surface pH and TEWL are observed in subjects with sensitive skin following topical application of lactic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Among these changes, increased TEWL, indicating a disrupted permeability barrier, has significant impact on cutaneous function. First, disruption of permeability barrier induces cutaneous inflammation via stimulation of proinflammatory cytokine release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], inflammatory cell maturation and infiltration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] while inflammation is a pathophysiological feature of sensitive skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Second, barrier disruption increases the density of mast cell, a major source of histamine, in the dermis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] whereas release of histamine can cause itching upon external stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The increased histamine could further disrupt epidermal permeability barrier via inhibition of keratinocyte differentiation and lipid production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Third, compromised permeability barrier increases cutaneous sensitivity to allergens through facilitation of allergen penetration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>] while increased transcutaneous penetration of substances is another feature of sensitive skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Taken together, compromised epidermal permeability barrier plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of sensitive skin. Therefore, the strategies to enhance epidermal permeability barrier have been recommended by experts for the management of sensitive skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. However, the availability of barrier-enhancing products for sensitive skin is still limited. In the present study, we compared the efficacy of Physiogel<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Intensive Cream (Stiefel Laboratories, Inc.&#x000a0;Middlesex, UK) and Atopalm<sup><bold>&#x000ae;</bold></sup> Multi-Lamellar Emulsion (MLE) Cream (NeoPharm Co., Ltd, Daejeon, Korea) for improving epidermal permeability barrier in Chinese with sensitive skin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>A randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial was conducted in 60 Chinese females with sensitive skin in an outpatient clinic.

The improvement in stratum corneum hydration was no different between these two products after 2 or 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment.

Since both Atopalm MLE Cream and Physiogel Intensive Cream improved epidermal permeability barrier, we next assessed whether these two products also improve LAST scores.

The preventive and therapeutic regimens are limited although moisturizers are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the present study, we showed that topical applications of these two products improved LAST scores, likely resulting from enhanced epidermal permeability barrier function in subjects with sensitive skin. Although both products contain stratum corneum lipids, which are known to improve epidermal permeability barrier in both normal and diseased skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], topical Atopalm MLE Cream induced a rapid improvement in epidermal permeability barrier after 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. In contrast, Physiogel Intensive Cream increased TEWL after 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment. The mechanisms underlying the difference in the efficacy between the two products are unclear. However, several potential variations in the formulations could affect the efficacy. First, the effects of stratum corneum lipid mixture on epidermal permeability barrier are largely determined by the molar ratio of these lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. The molar ratio of these lipids could be different between these two products. Second, the composition of the lipid mixture can also affect the efficacy of the products. For example, linoleic acid is not only the structural requirement for barrier formation, but also activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor &#x003b3; (PPAR &#x003b3;) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Activation of PPAR&#x003b3; stimulates epidermal lipid production and differentiation, both of which benefit epidermal permeability barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. The content of linoleic acid in cocos nucifera oil and butyrospermum parkii, sources of linoleic acid in Physiogel Intensive Cream, ranges 3&#x02013;11% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] while olea europaea (Olive) fruit oil and vitis vinifera seed oil, ingredients in Atopalm MLE Cream, are enriched in linoleic acid (as high as over 70%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Third, both antioxidant (tocopheryl acetate) and hyaluronate, ingredients in Atopalm MLE Cream, benefit the epidermal permeability barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>]. Moreover, myristoyl/palmitoyl oxostearamide/arachamide MEA upregulates epidermal PPAR&#x003b1; expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. The latter is crucial for maintenance of epidermal permeability barrier function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. Moreover, activation of either PPAR&#x003b1; or PPAR&#x003b3; inhibits cutaneous inflammation, which is a feature of sensitive skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>]. Thus, the different efficacy of these two products could be attributed to their compositional differences.</p><p>Although there were no untreated controls in the present study, the reduced TEWL value unlikely reflected spontaneous remission of disease due to the changes in humidity and/or environmental temperature. The study was carried from April (low humidity, spring) to August (high humidity, summer) during which environmental humidity and temperature gradually increased. Previous studies have shown that TEWL levels are lower in low humidity than in high humidity in both mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. TEWL levels in humans are higher in summer than in winter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. However, our results show that TEWL levels were reduced after treatment. Thus, the reduction in TEWL is likely attributable to the products.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that disruption of the epidermal permeability barrier enhances percutaneous penetration of a substance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>], and that enhancement of the epidermal permeability barrier can decrease cutaneous response to irritants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>] and improve inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In addition to facilitating percutaneous penetration of substances, a compromised permeability barrier alone can also provoke inflammation in sensitive skin. Thus, improved barrier function induced by these two products may not only alleviate inflammation, but may also prevent substances from penetrating the skin, suggesting potential utilization of these products for the prevention and treatment of sensitive skin. The present study also showed that both products increased stratum corneum hydration, which is low in sensitive skin. Previous studies have demonstrated that moisturizers improve sensitive skin. Hence, the beneficial effect of these two products on stratum corneum hydration provides another rationale for their usage in treating sensitive skin. However, whether other products, such as diaper cream, cis-Urocanic Acid emulsion cream and Canoderm that improves epidermal permeability barrier in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>], also benefits sensitive skin, remains to be determined. Moreover, further clinical studies are required to validate the efficacy and safety of these products before they are widely recommended to patients with sensitive skin.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Barrier-enhancing products such as Atopalm MLE Cream and Physiogel Intensive Cream are effective for improving the epidermal permeability barrier, stratum corneum hydration and LAST scores. The benefits of barrier-enhancing products means that barrier-enhancing strategies could be a valuable approach for preventing and treating sensitive skin.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
