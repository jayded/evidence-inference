Then, patients were randomly assigned to either the intervention group (n = 55) or the control group (n = 50) for 26 weeks. The patients in the control group were given metformin (1000&#x0200a;mg, bid po) and the patients in the intervention group were given metformin (500&#x0200a;mg, bid po) combined with alogliptin (25&#x0200a;mg, qd po). All the patients received counseling about diet and exercise from a nutritionist during run-in and treatment periods.</p><p>The primary endpoints were the between-group differences in the changes in pulmonary function parameters (vital capacity [VC]%, forced vital capacity [FVC]%, forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)%, peak expiratory force [PEF]%, maximal voluntary ventilation [MVV]%, total lung capacity [TLC%], forced expiratory volume in 1&#x0200a;second/forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC%], diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of lung [DLCO]%, and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of lung/unit volume [DLCO/VA%]) between pretherapy and posttreatment. The secondary endpoints were changes from baseline to week 26 in glycosylated hemoglobinA1c (HbA1c), FPG, 2hPG, homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), waist circumference (WC), and BMI. The tertiary endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in blood-fat (total cholesterol [TC], high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-C], low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C], and triglycerides [TG]). The quartus endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The 5th endpoints were the changes from baseline to week 26 in oxidative/antioxidative parameters (reactive oxygen species [ROS], malondialdehyde [MDA], superioxide dismutase [SOD], and glutathione peroxidase [GSH-Px]). In addition, safety endpoints were assessed (AEs, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiographic readings).</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results:</title><p>Eighty-one patients completed our clinical trial: intervention group (n = 44) and control group (n = 37). At week 26, pulmonary function parameters (VC%, FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, MVV%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and DLCO/VA%) had increased significantly from pretherapy values in both groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05), and the pulmonary function tests were significantly greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05) in intervention group than in controls posttherapy. Pulmonary function (FVC%, FEV1%, PEF%, TLC%, FEV1/FVC%, DLCO%, and DLCO/VA%) was lower in the group with HbA1c levels &#x02265;8.0 at 26 weeks, but VC%, FEV1%, MVV%, and TLC% were not significantly lower (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;0.05). Pulmonary function parameters were positively correlated with GSH-Px and SOD and negatively correlated with ROS and MDA. Mean declines in HbA1c, FPG, 2hPG, HOMA-IR, and blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG) were significantly greater (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05) in intervention group compared with the controls, but mean declines in BMI, WC, and BP (SBP, DBP) did not differ significantly between the 2 groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003e;&#x0200a;0.05).

Therefore, T2DM has been identified as an independent risk factor that accounts for a 2-fold increase in cardiovascular disease,<sup>[<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup> and induces vascular complications, such as diabetic nephropathy and diabetic retinopathy (DR).<sup>[<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup> Indeed, diabetic nephropathy and DR are leading causes of end-stage renal failure and acquired blindness, respectively.<sup>[<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup> This vascular damage caused by diabetes and hyperglycemia increase intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and malondialdehyde (MDA), decrease the activity of SOD and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), and subsequently lead to apoptotic cell death, inflammation, and injury of endothelial cells.<sup>[<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup></p><p>More than 3 decades ago, researchers had already established that patients with T2DM had less alveolar gas exchange capacity than healthy subjects.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> Later clinical and experimental studies suggested that T2DM attenuated pulmonary function through vascular damage through oxidant/antioxidant imbalance.<sup>[<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup> However, the pulmonary vascular injury induced by hyperglycemia has been overlooked in current treatment of T2DM. Smoking, obesity, vascular diseases, and the duration of diabetes also contributed notably to decreased lung function; however, current and ex-smokers manifested clinically significant chronic air flow obstruction,<sup>[<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</sup> and the patients often had T2DM combined with obesity.<sup>[<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</sup></p><p>Glucagon likepeptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone, can prevent high-glucose-induced oxidative stress in cardiac microvascular endothelial cells, possibly through inhibition of activation of the Rho/ROCK pathway.<sup>[<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup> By decreasing the GLP-1 level, dipeptydil-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors have become the new breakthrough diabetic therapy and been widely used in the diabetes mellitus treatment.<sup>[<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup> In patients with T2DM,<sup>[<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</sup> DPP-4 inhibitors stimulate release of glucose-dependent insulin and suppress glucagon production; DPP-4 inhibitors also slow gastric emptying, reduce appetite, decrease body weight, and potentially enhance preservation of &#x003b2;-cell function. However, little is known about whether DPP-4 inhibitors can improve pulmonary function by correcting oxidative/antioxidative imbalances and by protecting pulmonary vessels.</p><p>Alogliptin (alogliptin benzoate), the most recent DPP-4 inhibitor, entered the market in 2006. It is a potent and highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor with oral antidiabetic activity.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Like others DPP-4 inhibitors (vildagliptin) alogliptin does not produce any notable increase in body weight.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Metformin, a 1st-line drug, is most commonly prescribed worldwide for the treatment of T2DM. It functions by means of decreasing both hepatic glucose production and intestinal glucose absorption, and improving insulin sensitivity. Metformin as a safe and valid oral antidiabetic drug was recommended to the obese patients with a body mass index (BMI) &#x0003e;30&#x0200a;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. It is of value in reducing or preventing weight gain and changes in metabolic parameters during treatment, and it can be combined with other antidiabetic drugs.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup> In our research, we chose the initial dose (500&#x0200a;mg, bid po) of metformin and if the plasma sugar was inadequately controlled, the dose (1000&#x0200a;mg, bid po) of metformin was increased in the control group according to the guideline.<sup>[<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p><p>In the current study, we compared alogliptin combined with metformin with metformin alone to treat obese patients. Concerning T2DM patients inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy, we examined the effect of alogliptin on pulmonary function, and evaluated its efficacy and safety. In updated guidelines released by the American Diabetes Association,<sup>[<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</sup> metformin is recommended as the 1st-line drug for the treatment of T2DM because glycemic improvements and weight loss with metformin were rapid, sustained, and independent of age, race, and sex. For most patients, a combination of oral antidiabetic agents, with or without the use of insulin, is required to achieve and maintain treatment goals<sup>[<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</sup>; extensive phase II and phase III clinical trial data support the use of alogliptin in combination with metformin. Therefore, we choose to study alogliptin combined with metformin.</p><p>The aims of our study were to assess the effect of alogliptin combined with metformin on pulmonary function in obese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy with diet and exercise and to evaluate its efficacy and safety.</p></sec><sec><label>2</label><title>Patients and methods</title><sec><label>2.1</label><title>Patients</title><p>We selected 120 obese patients with type 2 diabetes inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy (500&#x0200a;mg, bid po, &#x02265;3 months prior to screening) from the Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism in the Fourth People's Hospital of Shenyang.

The screening period was 2 weeks (from &#x02212;6 to &#x02212;4 week); 120 eligible patients who met the study criteria were identified, screened, and enrolled. The run-in period was 4 weeks (from &#x02212;4 to 0 week); during this period, the patients were treated with metformin monotherapy (500&#x0200a;mg, bid po). At the end of this period, 105 patients remained in the study; 15 participants were excluded due to inadequate compliance and for other reasons.

Plasma glucose levels were determined by the glucose oxidase method. The oral glucose tolerance test method used 75&#x0200a;g of oral glucose (50% anhydrous glucose solution 150&#x0200a;mL including 7.5 bottles added to 150&#x0200a;mL warm water). Venous blood was extracted to measure the 2hPG.

We used the ratio of measured values and the expected values, % of predicted value, to eliminate the influence of age, height, and weight. Before testing, the patient remained sitting at quiet rest for at least 30&#x0200a;minutes, pulmonary function tests were performed 3 times and the best of 3 acceptable readings was used in the analysis.

If the patients could not tolerate the adverse reactions or the AEs appeared severe, they were withdrawn from the study. If symptoms of hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia appeared, a glucometer was used to measure the blood glucose level promptly. Hypoglycemia was defined as blood glucose &#x0003c;60&#x0200a;mg/dL/3.9&#x0200a;mmol/L in the presence of symptoms or blood glucose &#x0003c;50&#x0200a;mg/dL/2.8&#x0200a;mmol/L with or without symptoms.

The higher the level of HbA1c, the poorer the diabetic control and the higher the circulating glucose concentration. If circulating glucose is constantly elevated for 3 months (as measured by HbA1c), it can lead to increased nonenzymatic glycosylation of tissue proteins. The consistency with other studies persists even though the current study enrolled patients with HbA1c levels as low as 7.0%, whereas other studies excluded patients with baseline HbA1c levels &#x0003c;7.5%. This distinction is important in that the efficacy of antidiabetic agents appears to be greater in patients with higher baseline HbA1c levels.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> Studies by Pratley et al<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> showed that alogliptin lowered HbA1c to a greater degree in patients with higher baseline HbA1c than in those with lower baseline HbA1c.

The glucose was adequately controlled before our research was ended. After treatment period, the patients in the control group can comply with the treatment of intervention group (metformin [500&#x0200a;mg, bid po] combined with alogliptin [25&#x0200a;mg, qd po]) for the purpose of controlling the glucose adequately.</p><p>The mean change of BMI and WC did not differ significantly between the 2 groups, but compared to baseline, they both decreased significantly by week 26 in both groups (<italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05).

Damage to the cells ultimately produces secondary complications in diabetes mellitus, and the weakened defense system of the body becomes unable to counteract enhanced ROS generation. This leads to an imbalance between ROS and their protection that leads to the predominant condition of oxidative stress.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> Oxidized lipids are able to produce MDA as a decomposition product; increased levels of MDA in diabetics suggest that peroxidative injury may be involved in the development of diabetic complications. Lipid peroxidation also indicates a decline in the defense mechanisms of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. MDA can increase protein carbonyls as well as advanced oxidation protein products level in diabetic patients, which points to the importance of the protein conformational changes in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy.<sup>[<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</sup> GSH, a tripeptide, &#x003b3;-<sc>l</sc>-glutamyl-<sc>l</sc>-cysteinylglycine, is present in all mammalian tissues at 1 to 10&#x0200a;mM concentrations (the highest concentration in the liver) as the most abundant nonprotein thiol that defends against oxidative stress.

Consistent with improvements in glycemic control, better glycemic control could have led to improved oxidative/antioxidative balance. Our results indicate high-glucose-induced oxidative stress in our study population, and that glycemic control through metformin and alogliptin can improve oxidative/antioxidative imbalances through controlling hyperglycemia. Alogliptin can improve &#x003b2;-cell function, through this process imbalances of oxidative/antioxidative metabolism can be rectified.<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup></p><p>Mechanisms of lung damage due to diabetes are indefinite, however, glycemic control seems to be associated with the relationship between reduced lung function. Convincingly, collagen is less susceptible to proteolysis due to the nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins in the lungs and chest wall, contributing to its accumulation in lung connective tissue. Primarily triggered by hyperglycemia, this process is more pronounced in patients with poor metabolic control. In addition, the nonenzymatic glycosylation of proteins in the lungs decreases the compliance of lung.<sup>[<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]</sup> A large microvascular reserve is characteristic of the alveolar-capillary system, to which oxidative damage can be triggered, thus, the lung is damaged due to hyperglycemia.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> In clinical setting, the loss of microvascular reserve in the lung may be caused by increased risk of hypoxia in acute or chronic pathological lung conditions, such as pneumonia, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and congestive heart failure. Moreover, microvascular abnormalities frequently contribute to histological changes in the lung parenchyma, such as nodular fibrosis.<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> In addition, a very large surface area of the lungs, coupled with their ability to transport large amounts of oxygen to blood from the air, ensures a convenient portal for the entry of therapeutic agents.</p><p>Systemic inflammation is another concern in diabetic patients.

There has been a growing concern the concept of the lung as an organ affected by diabetic microangiopathy. In terms of lung function tests in diabetic patients over the last 15 years, studies have focused predominantly on pulmonary microangiopathy but relatively few studies on pulmonary mechanical function.

HbA1c is an indicator of diabetes control; our results revealed that the pulmonary function differed by HbA1c level: many pulmonary function parameters were better in patients with lower HbA1c levels. However, not all the parameters were significantly higher in the lower category of HbA1c level (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T5">5</xref>). In previous studies the correlations between the HbA1c and pulmonary function parameters were inconsistent; in 2 studies, the associations between HbA1c and spirometric measurements were weak or absent.<sup>[<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]</sup> Another cross-sectional population study revealed negative correlation between plasma glucose level and FVC and/or FEV.<sup>[<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</sup> Correlation analysis found that the pulmonary function parameters were positively correlated with GSH-Px and SOD, but negatively correlated with ROS and MDA had (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">6</xref>). Our results were similar to a previous report.<sup>[<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</sup> In this study, we could not observe the microangiopathy in the lung, but the pulmonary function improved in parallel with improvement in oxidative/antioxidative balance. However, it is noteworthy that good glycemic control and regular treatment positively affected functional lung parameters in T2DM patients.</p><p>AEs rates reported for alogliptin (24/55; 43.6%) in the present study were lower than those in similar studies of sitagliptin (56%),<sup>[<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]</sup> vildagliptin (50.3%),<sup>[<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup> and alogliptin (63%).<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup> The incidence of hyperglycemic rescues was lower in the intervention group (2/55; 3.6%) than in the control group (2/50; 4.0%), without significant difference (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.009, <italic>P</italic> = 0.923). The result that alogliptin (25&#x0200a;mg, qd po) combined with metformin (500&#x0200a;mg, bid po) did not increase the incidence of hyperglycemic rescues, was in agreement with Pratley and Nauck et al's study.<sup>[<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup> Serious AEs were severe infections, which were less frequent in the intervention group (1/55; 1.8%) than in controls (2/50; 4.0%), but not significantly different (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> = 0.449, <italic>P</italic> = 0.503). Gastrointestinal events, the most common AE, occurred less often in the intervention group (7/55; 12.7%) than in controls (8/50; 16.0%) and the total incidence of gastrointestinal events (15/105; 14.3%) was similar to Defronzo et al's study (12.1&#x02013;14.3%).<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Headache occurred more frequently in the intervention group (7/55; 12.7%; <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;&#x0003c;&#x0200a;0.05) than in controls (1/50; 2.0%). This finding, that alogliptin could increase the incidence of headache, was similar to Defronzo et al's study.<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> Despite strengthened surveillance for mild or moderate skin-related AEs, their overall incidence was low in the intervention group (7/55; 12.7%), albeit significantly greater than in controls (2/50; 4.0%), mostly because of pruritic events. Serious cutaneous AEs, such as moderate subcorneal pustular dermatosis, moderate exacerbation of contact dermatitis, and skin lesions similar to those from studies of other DPP-4 inhibitors, were not observed. Defronzo et al's study<sup>[<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup> reported that 2 patients discontinued treatment owing to skin-related AEs: 1 AE was possibly associated with the study drug (25&#x0200a;mg, moderate subcorneal pustular dermatosis). Hypoglycemia was infrequent (4/105; 3.8%) and was not serious. Overall, the addition of alogliptin to metformin led to additive therapeutic effects without any notable increase in body weight, hypoglycemic events, major cardiac events, or other AEs relative to metformin monotherapy and did not trigger clinically meaningful changes in vital signs, electrocardiograms, hematology, urinalysis, or serum chemistry.</p><p>There are several problems that will be resolved in the future. First, we could not observe the morphological changes in alveolar tissue and did not identify the protein that induced the damage to alveolar tissue. Because all the patients did not accept biopsy of the lung, we will adopt an animal model to study alveolar tissue. Second, the lung volume and mechanical function could be altered by IR through such mediators as leptin,<sup>[<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]</sup> we could not measure the leptin level in serum. Third, several longitudinal studies revealed an accelerated decline in lung function, a significant time-related effect of lung injury caused by diabetes, has been observed in longitudinal studies. However, findings about this topic are not completely in agreement: 2 other longitudinal studies, based on follow-up periods of 5 and 15 years, have revealed a similar decrease in FVC and FEV1 in diabetics and nondiabetics.<sup>[<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]</sup> Therefore, we will evaluate long-term therapy to observe the time-related effect of alogliptin combined with metformin on pulmonary function. Fourth, alogliptin and metformin have been found to boost circulating total GLP-1 levels in both nondiabetic and T2DM patients,<sup>[<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]</sup> but previous study did not report the total GLP-1 levels in T2DM patients treated by metformin combined with alogliptin; we plan to measure the total GLP-1 levels in the future. Fifth, with an increased use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) in T2DM, the complementary TCM therapy might decrease the risk of stroke in T2DM.<sup>[<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]</sup> In the future, we will observe the effect of TCM on pulmonary function in obese patients with T2DM. Finally, lung damage in T2DM will affect quality of life. Therefore, clinicians and patients are recommended to monitor lung damage in T2DM similar to monitoring for diabetic nephropathy and DR.</p><p>In conclusion, alogliptin provides significant improvements in pulmonary function, imbalance of the oxidative related substances, and glycemic control when added to metformin in T2DM patients who did not adequately respond to metformin monotherapy, with good safety and low risk of hypoglycemia and weight gain and without increasing the incidence of dyslipidemia and dysarteriotony. This indicates that patients and doctors should monitor lung function during treatment and that alogliptin is a viable treatment option for patients with T2DM failing on metformin who require a 2nd antihyperglycemic agent and are not candidates for an insulin therapy.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="abbr"><p>Abbreviations: AE = adverse event, BMI = body mass index, BP = blood pressure, DBP = diastolic blood pressure, DLCO = diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of lung, DLCO/VA = diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide of lung/unit volume, DPP-4 = dipeptydil-peptidase-4, DR = diabetic retinopathy, FEV1 = forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1/FVC = forced expiratory volume in 1&#x0200a;second/ forced vital capacity, FVC = forced vital capacity, GLP-1 = glucagon likepeptide-1, GSH-Px = glutathione peroxidase, HbA1c = glycosylated hemoglobinA1c, HDL-C = high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, HOMA-IR = homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance, IR = insulin resistance, LDL-C = low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, MDA = malondialdehyde, MVV = maximal voluntary ventilation, PEF = peak expiratory force, ROS = reactive oxygen species, SBP = systolic blood pressure, SOD = superioxide dismutase, T2DM = type 2 diabetes mellitus, TC = total cholesterol, TG = triglycerides, TLC = total lung capacity, VC = vital capacity, WC = waist circumference.</p></fn><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p>Funding/support: The study was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Shenyang F11-262-9-25.</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors have no conflicts of interest to disclose.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p>Author Contribution: He Tai wrote the manuscript and researched data; Ming-yue Wang reaearched the data and contributed to the discussion; Yue-ping Zhao selected the patients and extracted venous blood; Ling-Bing Li reaearched the data; Qianyan Dong recorded the data and researched the data; Xin-guang Liu recorded the data and researched the data; Jin-song Kuang contributed to the discussion and reviewed the manuscript.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p>Clinical no: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02798172).</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="R1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>RC</given-names></name><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>JC</given-names></name></person-group>
