One of the swollen joints had to be a knee, ankle or wrist joint that was accessible for arthroscopy. Patients were allowed to use concomitant methotrexate, which had to be stable for at least 28 days. They were not allowed to use any other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) 1 month prior to baseline. For leflunomide, a 2-month washout period was required. Use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs was allowed, provided that the dose had been stable for at least 28 days. Parenteral, intra-articular or oral use of corticosteroids within 28 days before enrolment into the study was not allowed. Topical treatments for psoriasis were not allowed 14 days prior to baseline, with the exception of low potency (class I) topical steroids to be used on scalp, palms, groin and/or soles of feet only. Other exclusion criteria were the use of any biological agent or investigational drug within the previous 6 months and having a history of tuberculosis or a malignancy in the past 10 years. Infection with HIV, hepatitis B or C virus was excluded via serological testing. Patients with another serious infection within 4 weeks before baseline, or a significant history of cardiac, renal, neurological or metabolic disease were excluded from the study. Female patients who were pregnant or breastfeeding were not allowed to enter the study.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Study protocol</title><p>This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single centre study performed at the Academic Medical Center of the University of Amsterdam.

Routine clinical chemistry, haematology and urinalysis assessments were performed, as well as a chest <italic>x</italic> ray and purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test prior to baseline to exclude patients with (latent) tuberculosis.

Furthermore, C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) were determined. A blinded, independent assessor performed the clinical evaluation.

The results presented here show that clinically effective adalimumab therapy is particularly associated with a marked reduction in CD3-positive T cell infiltration and expression of MMP13 in the ST of patients with PsA 4 weeks after initiation of treatment.</p><p>Previous work on synovial biomarkers in patients with PsA has been mainly limited to open studies, mostly of longer duration. Open label treatment of 10 patients with PsA with methotrexate resulted in a decrease in T cells and macrophages as well as reduced expression of IL8, E-selectin, intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and MMP3 after 6 to 12 months of treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> In another study 52 patients with peripheral arthritis due to spondyloarthritis were included; 16 of these had PsA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref> The patients underwent synovial biopsy at baseline and 12 weeks following different treatment regimens (infliximab, etanercept, sulfasalazine or no DMARD). Clinical improvement correlated with a decrease in CD163-positive macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs) and MMP3 expression. A study on the effects of TNF blockade showed in 11 patients with PsA, who were treated with infliximab (3 mg/kg) combined with stable methotrexate treatment, a significant reduction of ICAM-1, vWF and &#x003b1;v&#x003b2;3 expression.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> There was also a trend towards a reduction of T cells and macrophages. Similarly, another study demonstrated a decrease in macrophage numbers and vascular markers in the synovium of nine patients with PsA 8 weeks after initiation of infliximab (5 mg/kg) treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> A study on the effects of alefacept revealed a significant decrease in T cell numbers after 4 weeks of treatment, and a significant reduction of T cells and macrophages after 12 weeks of treatment in 11 patients with PsA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> Finally, experimental treatment with IL10 subcutaneously for 4 weeks resulted in decreased T cell and macrophage infiltration in the synovium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref></p><p>The present study was designed to determine which synovial biomarkers are associated on the group level with active treatment, identical to the approach that we have previously described in patients with RA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> In RA macrophage numbers were previously identified as synovial biomarkers associated with active treatment. These results have been confirmed and validated in various studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref> Of interest, although we did observe clear trends towards decreased numbers of macrophages and macrophage subsets after active treatment, analysis of covariance indicates that in PsA especially the number of CD3-positive T cells and the expression of MMP13 could be used to screen for potentially active drugs in small proof of concept studies of short duration. The results presented here underscore the important role of T cells in the pathogenesis of PsA,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref> consistent with the observation that specific targeting of T cells may result in clinical benefit in this disease.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref></p><p>A potential drawback of this study is the fact that there were baseline differences&#x02014;in clinical and synovial variables&#x02014;between the adalimumab and placebo group despite randomisation, which is probably related to the relatively small number of patients. The ANCOVA model, however, includes the baseline value for each marker as a covariate, thereby correcting for these baseline imbalances.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> Using this model to describe the relationship between clinical improvement and changes in ST, the effect of treatment was sustained for a reduction of T cells and MMP13 expression. Another potential limitation of this exploratory study is related to the high number of synovial parameters tested and the chance of erroneously reporting statistical significance in the context of multiple comparisons. The limited power of our study did not allow a conservative Bonferroni correction. Of importance, other investigators have very recently independently confirmed the specific decrease in CD3+ T cells in the synovium after initiation of TNF blockade in patients with PsA.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref> Thus, it appears unlikely that the identification of CD3+ T cells as a key synovial biomarker associated with active treatment can merely be explained by chance.</p><p>The reduction of synovial inflammation associated with clinical improvement of the joint and skin after adalimumab treatment is also consistent with previous reports showing a decrease in leukocyte numbers (including T cells and macrophages), as well as reduced vascularity and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and MMPs in the synovium of patients with PsA after infliximab treatment.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><sup>&#x02013;</sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> The cellular changes might be explained in part by changes in cell migration due to reduced neoangiogenesis and reduced expression of adhesion molecules and chemokines, as suggested previously.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref></p><p>Analysis of molecular markers in synovial tissue is increasingly used in clinical trials on targeted therapies. With this approach, tissue specificity is not a problem and examination of serial biopsy samples can be used to monitor the response in individual patients and screen for interesting biological effects at the site of inflammation. This study clearly shows that changes in T cell numbers and the expression of MMP13 in the synovium of patients with PsA may be used as biomarkers to screen for effective therapies during early drug development. It can be anticipated that future developments will include the use of more extensive markers of synovial inflammation and joint degradation as well as the use of panels of biomarkers in serum and synovial tissue samples.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank Ilse Burgman, Marjolein Vinkenoog and Dr Tom Smeets for their expert assistance with immunohistochemistry and digital image analysis.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This clinical study was supported by Abbott BV, The Netherlands.
