Thus, the treatment and prevention of gingivitis is a valuable goal in periodontal therapy.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] There is evidence which demonstrates that improving oral hygiene and gingival health has been associated with a decreasing incidence of periodontal disease. On the basis that plaque-induced gingivitis always precedes the occurrence and recurrence of periodontitis, the mainstay of primary and secondary prevention of periodontal diseases is the control of supragingival plaque.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>Until now, mechanical cleansing is the most widely used method of supragingival plaque control and is effective in areas where access to plaque deposits is possible.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Evidences exist that the degree of motivation and skill required with the oral hygiene products such as toothbrushes, dental floss, toothpicks, and interdental brushes may be beyond the ability of majority of the patients. There are also groups of individuals such as temporarily disabled individuals including non-ambulatory patients and handicapped people, for whom adequate oral hygiene is a problem.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Therefore, an alternative method of plaque control would be desirable.</p><p>Many kinds of chemical substances have been investigated. The major problem of these substances has been the relatively short period of contact between active agent and the teeth, and existence of the side effects. Chlorhexidine (CHX) is the chemical agent which seems to be most effective in plaque control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Its effect is prolonged and it has the ability to inhibit plaque formation to a large degree.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] It is used as mouthwash, gel, sprays, varnish,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] and in toothpastes.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>]</p><p>Though CHX is considered as the best agent for plaque control and gingivitis, many patients find its initial bitter taste unpleasant, and repeated use often produces stains and taste disturbances. Because of this, daily rinsing with CHX is not promoted. It would, however, be desirable to have the possibility to use CHX over an extended period of time. The absence of stain formation could improve patient compliance and reduce the time necessary to clean the dentition during recall.</p><p>Oxygenating agents have been employed for supragingival plaque control and in the treatment of acute ulcerative gingivitis without any harmful side effects on the tissues.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] Hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) 1.5% has been shown to have a good stain removing capability both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The mechanism of stain removal includes oxygen-releasing mechanical cleansing actions and oxidation or reduction reactions. Free radicals released by hydrogen peroxide break the electron-rich alkene double bonds which are responsible for discoloration, resulting in stain removal.</p><p>The use of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an adjunct to CHX has been found to be very effective in reducing plaque scores, and in preventing the stain development.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] The purpose of this study was to investigate whether the use of a hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse as an adjunct to chlorhexidine mouth rinse compared to chlorhexidine alone is efficacious in inhibiting the development of plaque and gingivitis, along with its ability to reduce the stains.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This 21 days duration study was conducted in the department of Periodontics, of the institution. A total of 105 subjects participated in the study, out of which 55 (57.75%) were females and 50 (52.5%) were males. The subjects included BDS and dental hygienist students of the college, and the patients visiting the outpatient department of Periodontics. The patients were informed about the study and a written consent was obtained. Inclusion criteria were: (a) healthy patients of age group between 18 and 30 years, (b) no history of smoking,(c) Minimum of 24 teeth present, (d) no pockets &#x0003e;5 mm present, (e) no antibiotics intake for last 3 months, and (f) no systemic disease. Exclusion criteria were: (1) Presence of fixed or removable orthodontic appliance or prosthesis, (2) allergy to chlorhexidine or hydrogen peroxide, and (3) pregnant females. Scaling with ultrasonic scaler and polishing with fine grit prophylaxis paste was done for all the subjects to establish the baseline. All the subjects were given the demonstration of Bass method of tooth brushing and were asked to follow the same using Stim<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> soft toothbrush and Colgate<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> toothpaste prior to rinsing.</p><p>The selected candidates were randomly divided into one of the three treatment groups; each group comprises 35 subjects. Group I was instructed to rinse with 0.2% CHX (Hexidine<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) twice daily (60 s) for 3 weeks after brushing.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] Group II was instructed to rinse with 0.2% CHX (60 s) followed by 1.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (60 s) twice daily for 3 weeks after brushing. Group III was asked to rinse with 1.5% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (60 s) followed by 0.2% CHX (60 seconds) twice daily for 3 weeks after brushing. The subjects were asked to return after the end of first, second and third week for the evaluation, to check the compliance and to issue more mouthwash.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Preparation of hydrogen peroxide mouth rinse</title><p>The subjects were instructed to add 2.5 ml of Hydroxyl<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> mouthwash (6%) to 7.5 ml of water to make it 1.5% with the measuring cap provided with the mouthwash, just before every rinse.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Clinical examination</title><p>The name, age, gender, and address of the subjects were recorded in the performa. They were examined clinically with a mouth mirror, UNC15 periodontal probe and explorer.</p><p>The scoring procedure used to assess stain area and intensity was the Lobene index modified by Koertge and Gunsolley (GMSI)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] with the following criteria: Stain intensity: 0 = No stain present, natural tooth coloration, 1 = faint stain 2 = clearly visible stain, orange to brown, 3 = dark stain, deep brown to black. Stain area 1 = thin line, can be continuous, 2 = thick line or band, 3 = covering the total area.</p><p>Plaque Index (PI):- The clinical scoring procedure used to assess plaque formation was the Turesky modification of the Quigley-Hein plaque index.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] A disclosing agent (alpha plaque) was used to score plaque on a numerical scale according to the following criteria: 0 = No plaque, 1 = Separate flecks of plaque at the cervical margin of the tooth, 2 = A thin, continuous band of plaque (up to 1 mm) at the cervical margin, 3 = A band of plaque wider than 1 mm but covering less than one-third of the crown, 4 = Plaque covering at least one-third but less than two-thirds of the crown and 5 = Plaque covering two-thirds or more of the crown.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Mean of all the individual subject scores at the end of 1<sup>st</sup>, 2<sup>nd</sup>, and 3<sup>rd</sup> week was calculated for stain intensity, stain area, and plaque.

Till date, mechanical plaque elimination with assorted devices remains the primary and most widely accepted means of controlling plaque and maintaining good oral hygiene. As an adjunct to mechanical methods, chemical plaque control comprising of a variety of chemotherapeutic agents have been beneficial and desirable.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] The greatest success has been with chlorhexidine, which is now considered the gold standard against which other potential antiplaque agents are measured.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] However, the local side effects of chlorhexidine, particularly extrinsic staining and taste aberrations, have limited its long-term use in oral hygiene products.</p><p>The present study was initiated to evaluate the inhibitory properties of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> on extrinsic stains induced by rinsing with CHX. The effect of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> when used in combination with CHX on reducing plaque formation was also evaluated.</p><p>The results of the present study show a tendency toward less stain development when CHX is used in combination with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as compared to using it alone, as is evident from Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref>. At the end of 2<sup>nd</sup> week, the intensity of stains was significantly less in group II in comparison with group I. At the end of 1<sup>st</sup> week, group II showed significantly less stain intensity in comparison to group III; thus indicating more efficiency of CHX + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> regimen over H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CHX regimen. This finding has been supported in the study done by Eriksen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] in a group of 50 military recruits. In a double-blind experimental design, the combination of 0.2% chlorhexidine and 1% peroxymonosulfate solution resulted in a marked reduction in extrinsic tooth discoloration along with maintained plaque preventive capacity of chlorhexidine. Similar results were obtained in the study done by Grundemann <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] who demonstrated that combination of chlorhexidine and peroxyborate (CHX + PER) resulted in less stains than CHX alone at the end of 14 days of rinsing.</p><p>There is however no doubt that chlorhexidine readily binds food dyes and chromogens to surfaces. Eriksen <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] indicated that chlorhexidine treatment alters the incorporation into plaque of a natural sulphur-containing organic component of saliva or bacteria. This natural component appears to readily interact with transition metals, particularly iron, producing stained material. Both ferric and stannic sulphides are strongly colored. These colors correlate well with clinically observed extrinsic discolorations. In a more oxidized state, these sulfide compounds transform into sulfates which generally become greyish/white and soluble. This may be an explanation of why rinsing with an oxidizing solution inhibits the staining of teeth.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Our study compared three different regimens: Post-brushing rinsing twice daily with chlorhexidine (CHX:CHX), chlorhexidine 0.2% followed by hydrogen peroxide 1.5% (CHX + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>:CHX + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>); and hydrogen peroxide followed by chlorhexidine (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CHX:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CHX). The regimens CHX + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>:CHX + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CHX:H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> + CHX were more effective in inhibiting plaque than regimen CHX:CHX. The mean plaque scores in group II and group III after the end of 1and 2 weeks were significantly less than group I as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. After 3 weeks, there was a non-significant difference in plaque scores between group I and group III; group III being better of the two. However, in group II, the plaque scores were significantly less than the other two groups after the end of 1, 2, and 3 weeks. This is in agreement with a previous study by Dona <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] in which an adjunctive effect of sodium-perborate on the plaque-reducing effect of chlorhexidine was found.</p><p>The results of present study show that the therapeutic action of chlorhexidine 0.2% to inhibit supragingival plaque does not seem to be disturbed when it is used together with hydrogen peroxide solution. Rather rinsing with chlorhexidine with hydrogen peroxide combination even enhances plaque inhibition. This could be an additive effect since both chemicals have a different action with regards to bacterial killing. As an antiplaque mouth rinse, the mode of action of chlorhexidine is purely topical. Seymour and Heasman[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] in 1992 stated that killing of bacterial cells is initially dependant on the drug having access to the cell walls. The therapeutic action of hydrogen peroxide is obtained by the release of oxygen that instantly kills the obligate anaerobes implicated in oral infections.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>]</p><p>It has been hypothesized that sodium lauryl sulphate (SLS), the most widely used detergent in dentifrice, may counteract with chlorhexidine. A study was done by Van Strydonck <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] in 2004 and 2006[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] to compare the plaque inhibitory effect of a 0.2% chlorhexidine digluconate rinse when preceded by ordinary tooth brushing with a 1.5% SLS-containing dentifrice to the effect of the same rinse when used alone or when preceded by rinsing with an SLS-containing slurry. The study showed that the anti-plaque efficacy of a 0.2% CHX rinse was not reduced when preceded by everyday tooth brushing with a SLS-containing dentifrice.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>From this study, it can be concluded that a combination of CHX + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is superior to CHX alone, when used as mouthwash as an adjunct to routine mechanical tooth cleansing. A twice daily rinsing with CHX + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> combination can be safely recommended to minimize extrinsic tooth discoloration without affecting the plaque inhibiting efficacy of CHX since the removal of stains caused by using CHX alone, especially in pits and fissures, is a tedious procedure for a periodontist. The combination enhances the efficacy of chlorhexidine in reducing plaque formation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</title><p>I thank all the B.D.S. and Dental hygienist students, and the patients who agreed to take part in this study, and Government Dental College Shimla administration for their help and support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Jan</surname><given-names>AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Verkade</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Timmerman</surname><given-names>MF</given-names></name><name><surname>Van der Weijden</surname><given-names>FA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Comparison of two commercial chlorhexidine mouthwashes</article-title><source>J Periodontol</source><year>2003</year><volume>74</volume><fpage>214</fpage><lpage>8</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">12666710</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Lindhe</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Karring</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Lang</surname><given-names>NP</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Clinical Periodontology and Implant Dentistry</article-title><year>2003</year><edition>4th ed</edition><publisher-loc>Oxford</publisher-loc><publisher-name>Blackwell Munksgaard</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Francesso</surname><given-names>AG</given-names></name><name><surname>Sampathkumar</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Beatrice</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Microbiological and clinical effects of chlorhexidine digluconate and hydrogen peroxide mouthrinse on developing plaque and gingivitis</article-title><source>J Clin Periodontol</source><year>1988</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>60</fpage><lpage>7</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">3422246</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fischman</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>History of oral hygiene products.
