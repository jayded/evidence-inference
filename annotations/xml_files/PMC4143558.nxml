In the absence of conscious visual experience, patients with visual cortex damage discriminate the valence of emotional expression. Even in healthy individuals, a subliminal mechanism can be utilized to compensate for a functional decline in visual cognition of various causes such as strong sleepiness. In this study, sleep deprivation was simulated in healthy individuals to investigate functional alterations in the subliminal processing of emotional information caused by reduced conscious visual cognition and attention due to an increase in subjective sleepiness. Fourteen healthy adult men participated in a within-subject crossover study consisting of a 5-day session of sleep debt (SD, 4-h sleep) and a 5-day session of sleep control (SC, 8-h sleep).

In fear-neutral contrasts, subjective sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity of the bilateral amygdala.

In addition, enhancement of subliminal emotional processing might cause involuntary emotional instability during sleep debt through changes in emotional response to or emotional evaluation of external stimuli.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Sleepiness</kwd><kwd>Nonconscious</kwd><kwd>Unconscious</kwd><kwd>Subliminal</kwd><kwd>Emotion</kwd><kwd>Fearful face</kwd><kwd>Amygdala</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2014</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p>Perceptual information that elicits emotional responses is partially processed without surfacing to the conscious mind, and the subcortical brain region is thought to play various roles in this process. Even a subliminal emotional stimulus can elicit a specific physiological response. For example, the amygdala, the brain area responsible for emotional cognition, is activated even when the subject is not aware of any emotional stimulus due to backward masking of a brief visual stimulus by a different emotional stimulus presented immediately following the target stimulus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] or due to binocular rivalry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Subcortical regions such as the superior colliculus, pulvinar, and basal ganglia mediate the signal transduction pathway responsible for such physiological responses. Although it has been conventionally thought that signals were transmitted from the retina to the amygdala via the superior colliculus and pulvinar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], there is now some debate over the details following a recent proposal that the subcortical signal pathway has a complex structure comprising several branches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Representative findings in support of the subliminal processing of emotions indicate that when presented with emotional facial expressions, patients with visual cortex damage discriminated emotional valence of facial expressions in the absence of conscious visual experience [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], showed different physiological responses for each emotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and had an activated subcortical pathway on functional brain imaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Such phenomena were once thought to be special examples of an otherwise hidden mechanism in healthy individuals that is only exposed by a loss of conscious visual cognition. However, this subliminal process might be utilized in healthy individuals with temporally or functionally impaired visual cognition.</p><p>One of the factors in daily life that can affect visual cognition is sleep debt. Simulation studies of sleep debt (i.e., overnight total sleep deprivation) consistently show that, in addition to a marked decline in viewing-task performance, reduced activity in the parietal and occipital lobes involved in visual cognition and attention is proportional to individual vulnerability to sleep deprivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similar results were obtained from cognitive tasks on working memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], vigilance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], language learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], and logical thinking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], indicating that a decline in task performance is caused by a functional decline in visual cognition and attention due to sleep debt.</p><p>Swann et al. reported shortened response times to subliminal priming after 2&#x000a0;days of short sleep, and stated that a decline in high-order supraliminal function due to sleepiness activated a compensatory subliminal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, the subliminal process might work as a system that compensates for the decline seen in the level of consciousness with strong sleepiness, a situation that poses considerable danger to survival. For example, as a prey animal, a certain rabbit species sleeps with their eyes open in the wild, during which time their electroencephalograms show brain activation due to visual stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This is advantageous because it enables the animals to respond quickly to an attack by natural enemies, by waking up and engaging in avoidance behavior. Subliminal hazard perception might also be preserved in humans by activation via the pathway for subliminal information during episodes of strong sleepiness.</p><p>In this study, sleep debt was simulated to determine whether an increase in sleepiness induces a decline in conscious visual cognition and attention as well as activation of subliminal emotion processing.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethics</title><p>This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry, Japan, and was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants were 14 healthy, right-handed adult men (mean&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;standard deviation age, 24.1&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;3.32&#x000a0;years) who provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study.

For each image, motion and slice-timing correction as well as co-registration into an MPRAGE structural image was performed. The Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template was used for spatial normalization, and smoothing was performed using an 8-mm full width half maximum Gaussian kernel. MRI time-series data that contained three-dimensional blood-oxygenation-level-dependent (BOLD) signals of each participant were analyzed using the first-level fixed effects model with general linear model regression analysis. Using the canonical hemodynamic response function implemented in SPM8, a hypothetical hemodynamic time course corresponding to the stimulus presentations under each face-viewing task condition was developed by convolving the hemodynamic response function. Incorporated into the design matrix were 13 hemodynamic models of time series corresponding to the following: i) 6 conditions [3 categories of emotions (happy, fear, and neutral)&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;2 types of image presentation (conscious and non-conscious)], ii) target image presentation, and iii) 6 head motions as regressors.

Because we were particularly interested in the subliminal visual pathway based on a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>], we placed the target ROI in the superior colliculus as this region transmits visual information to the amygdala directly. Using WFU PickAtlas software from the SPM Toolbox, a mask for the superior colliculus was generated based on peak coordinates from results of the previous study.</p><p>Functional connectivity between the amygdala and superior colliculus (Fc<sub>AMG-SCo</sub>) was calculated using CONN toolbox version 13.1 (Alfonso Nieto-Castanon, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.alfnie.com/software/conn">http://www.alfnie.com/software/conn</ext-link>). Voxel-by-voxel GLM analyses were conducted, with the regression of time-series data in each voxel within the target ROI (superior colliculus) on the time-series data in the seed region. Head motions and hypothetical hemodynamic response to the main event (confounding effects of stimulus-locked transients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]) were used as regressors. Bandpass-filter range was set at 0.008-0.09&#x000a0;Hz. Individual GLM analyses produced individual estimation maps (beta-maps) for the two sleep conditions (SD or SC) and the two kinds of facial presentation (nonconscious fearful or nonconscious neutral). We first checked the existence of statistically significant FcAMG-SCo during observation of fearful and neutral faces separately using t-tests, and also checked the differential FcAMG-SCo between fearful and neutral faces. Next, the individual beta maps in each facial condition were fed into the correlation analysis with the sleepiness at the time when the data were obtained.</p><p>Results were considered significant if <italic>p</italic> was less than 0.001 and the number of continuous voxels forming a cluster was greater than 5.

In particular, the intensity of amygdala activity in response to a fearful expression was significantly positively correlated with subjective sleepiness. On the other hand, in the secondary and tertiary visual areas and the fusiform face area specialized for visual cognition of facial expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>], activity was negatively correlated with subjective sleepiness. We found functional connectivity between the amygdala and superior colliculus (Fc<sub>AMG-SCo</sub>) during presentation of the fearful face. Further, changes in subjective sleepiness (the difference between the SC and SD sessions) were correlated with both changes in amygdala activity and Fc<sub>AMG-SCo</sub> in response to subliminal fearful faces. These findings suggest that an increase in sleepiness enhances subliminal emotion processing that engages the amygdala and its connection to the superior colliculus. They also suggest that an increase in sleepiness enhances amygdala activity and overall subliminal emotion processing via the superior colliculus while at the same time reducing activity in areas involved in visual cognition.</p><p>The amygdala is known to play an important role in evoking negative emotional responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Although visual perception of fearful facial expressions leads to amygdala activation in healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], this activation is more pronounced in patients with depression and anxiety disorder [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. On the other hand, when fearful expressions are presented nonconsciously or outside the focus of attention, amygdala activation is similar to that observed under conscious presentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>The present findings revealed that activation of the amygdala in response to subliminal negative emotional stimuli was augmented by an increase in sleepiness. The amygdala is neurally connected to brain regions such as the insular cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and hippocampus, and together they form the brain&#x02019;s emotion network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. We found that activity of the emotion network in response to a fearful facial expression increased as sleepiness intensified. However, after subtracting the effect of the neutral expression, the amygdala was the only brain region significantly correlated with sleepiness. In other words, during strong sleepiness, the response to negative emotional stimuli was altered most noticeably in the amygdala.</p><p>During neutral facial image presentation, subjective sleepiness was significantly positively correlated with activity in the precuneus, posterior cingulate cortex, and medial prefrontal cortex. These regions form the DMN area, which is activated strongly during rest not involving tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Sleep deprivation was found to enhance activity in the DMN area during a task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In the present study, sleep debt augmented activity in the DMN area during nonconscious presentation of neutral, but not fearful, expressions. Images that remained at the conscious level were neutral facial images under both presentations, suggesting that nonconscious presentation of fearful expressions might enhance attention toward subliminal warnings and prevent the default mode of activity in the DMN area.</p><p>Activity in the amygdala increased in participants who experienced intense sleepiness despite reduced responsiveness in the visual area involved in fearful expression. This suggests that subliminal visual signals are transmitted to the amygdala via an alternative pathway that bypasses the visual cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the backward-masking task, a fearful expression was presented for a mere 26&#x000a0;ms without eliciting conscious perception, followed by presentation of a neutral expression long enough (176&#x000a0;ms) to ensure visual cognition. Under mild sleepiness (i.e., highly alert with functional attentional mechanisms), information on neutral facial expression is transmitted to the amygdala via the pathway involved in conscious vision, which might cancel out information from fearful (and fear-neutral) expressions transmitted via the subliminal pathway. When subjects were asked to perform an affect-labeling task to describe the emotion presented in the individual facial stimuli, self-reported distress toward the facial stimuli was reduced compared with the normal viewing task [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], and the activity of amygdala was suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. Given that the activity in the cortical area involved in visual face recognition was reduced under strong sleepiness in the present study, it is possible that affect labeling of currently presented faces (which remains at the conscious level) is impossible when highly sleepy, exposing the presence and impact of fearful information transmitted via the subliminal pathway.</p><p>In this study, nonconscious presentation of fearful facial expressions enhanced the activity of amygdala despite the reduced activity in the cortical area involved in facial recognition. The functional significance of this phenomenon might be that a primitive subliminal hazard perception system was utilized as an alternative mechanism in response to the functional decline in conscious emotion processing. The superior colliculus, which is present in the brain area presumably involved in the subliminal pathway, functions as the center of visual processing in fish and amphibians. On the other hand, the superior colliculus constitutes a small portion of the whole brain in humans, and therefore its function is considered phylogenetically old [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. In ancient times, fearful facial expressions were important tools for conveying imminent life-threatening danger among tribal members and functioned as basic warning signs among them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. It is therefore possible that declines in supraliminal visual cognitive and attentional function due to strong sleepiness evoked strong reactions toward fearful expressions via the phylogenetically old subliminal pathway of emotional processing. It is also possible that the subliminal pathway is involved in the rapid transmission of danger-related information because subliminal information is reportedly transmitted faster than supraliminal information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, as shown in this study, activation of subliminal emotional processing due to enhanced sleepiness might also affect emotional adjustment during sleep debt. Although mood decline is likely to occur in response to mild stressors during sleep debt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], sleep deprivation was reported to increase sensitivity to pleasurable experiences by lowering the threshold value in a task judging valence of pleasure-evoking pictures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. A change in nonconscious emotion processing can influence one&#x02019;s conscious state, such as mood, feeling or emotional evaluation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. Previous studies using nonconscious emotional stimuli have indicated that subjects can be unaware of their own emotional responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. According to the somatic marker hypothesis (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] for details), changes in bodily response such as sympathetic hyperactivity can strongly affect subjective feelings and emotional evaluation without one&#x02019;s conscious awareness of the responses. The amygdala and insula, where activation due to sleepiness was observed in this study, are involved in autonomic nervous system regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Our findings suggest that the enhancement of subliminal emotional processing during sleep debt might result in involuntary emotional instability, either directly or indirectly (e.g. through change of bodily response), without self-awareness. Because we did not measure sympathetic nervous system indices such as the respiratory and cardiac cycle in this study, we could not confirm that sympathetic activity accompanied enhanced amygdala activity during strong sleepiness. Moreover, the amygdala activation could be explained as the result of increased sympathetic activity due to sleep deprivation. Future studies should ideally measure indices such as heart rate and respiratory rate in the MRI scanner. In this study, however, the activity of the amygdala was changed by sleepiness only when observing fearful faces, not neutral faces, so a change in the sympathetic system does not completely explain the changes seen in nonconscious emotion responses, although sleepiness should impact subliminal emotional processing and alter amygdala activation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Sleepiness induced functional decline in brain areas involved in conscious visual cognition of facial expressions, but also enhanced subliminal emotional processing as represented by activity in the amygdala. These findings suggest that an evolutionally old and auxiliary subliminal hazard perception system is activated as a compensatory mechanism when conscious visual cognition is impaired. In addition, enhancement of subliminal emotional processing might cause involuntary emotional instability during sleep debt through changes in emotional response to or evaluation of external stimuli.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-list><def-item><term>SD</term><def><p>Sleep debt</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SC</term><def><p>Sleep control</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MRI</term><def><p>Magnetic resonance imaging</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>fMRI</term><def><p>Functional MRI</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MNI</term><def><p>Montreal neurological institute</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BOLD</term><def><p>Blood oxygenation level dependent</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>GLM</term><def><p>General linear model</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DMN</term><def><p>Default mode network.</p></def></def-item></def-list></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>YM, SK, KO, YT, YM, and KM designed the study; YM, SK, ME, YK, and AH conducted the sleep restriction experiment; YM, OK, and YT ran the fMRI experiment; YM and YM analyzed the fMRI data; YM, SK, KO, YT, YM, SH, and KM interpreted the data; YM, YM, SH, and KM wrote the manuscript.
