Patients experience long<bold>-</bold>term health care problems, affecting quality of life (QOL) including frequent acute pain, which is difficult to document in trials except as hospital admissions. Pilot data suggests that overnight respiratory support, either supplementary oxygen or auto<bold>-</bold>adjusting continuous positive airways pressure (APAP), is safe and may have clinical benefit. This pilot trial aims to determine which intervention is more acceptable to participants and whether there are other advantages of one over the other, e.g. in respiratory function or haematological parameters, before conducting the Phase 2 trial of overnight respiratory support funded by the National Institutes of Health Research.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This is a pilot cross<bold>-</bold>over interventional trial with the order of interventions decided by simple randomization. Ten adults (age over 18 years) and 10 children (aged between 8 and 18 years) with homozygous sickle cell disease (haemoglobin SS, HbSS), recruited regardless of symptoms of sleep<bold>-</bold>disordered breathing, will undergo overnight pulse oximetry and will have two interventions, overnight oxygen and APAP, for a week each in randomised order with a washout week between interventions. Participants will complete online diaries via an iPad throughout the 29 days of the study and will complete QOL questionnaires and have measurement of haematology, biochemistry, spirometry and lung volumes (adults only) at 3 time points, at baseline and after each intervention, as well as in-depth semi-structured qualitative interviews after each intervention, carried out by an experienced psychologist. Both qualitative and statistical methods will be used to analyze the data. The primary outcome is qualitative data looking at participant experience from the transcribed interviews after each intervention. The participant&#x02019;s view on feasibility, acceptability and preference will specifically be explored. The QOL, laboratory and lung function data will be compared with baseline for each arm.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Patient and public involvement is an integral part of this trial and the key outcome is the qualitative result, which is dependent on obtaining good quality data to advise on participant feasibility, acceptability and preference. This is being addressed by using a standard interview. The development of a pain endpoint is another important outcome and collecting daily measurements is likely to be challenging. Research results will be used to inform design of the Phase 2 trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>

SCA affects an estimated 15,000 people [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] in the UK and patients experience long<bold>-</bold>term health care problems, including pain and neurocognitive problems, which affect quality of life. Emergency presentations are typically due to acute sickle cell pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and account for over 6000 emergency admissions and over 25,000 bed days per year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Mortality in children in England has improved over recent years with around 99 % now surviving to 18 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Life expectancy is, however, shortened to 40&#x02013;50 years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] and quality of life is compromised by chronic complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>The prevalences of <italic>intermittent</italic> nocturnal haemoglobin oxygen desaturation, secondary to sleep<bold>-</bold>disordered breathing, and <italic>sustained</italic> daytime and nocturnal haemoglobin oxygen desaturation, are high in patients with SCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. There is an association between low oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and SCA complications, including stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], enuresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] and priapism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] as well as painful crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], although the latter is controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], perhaps related to differences in documentation of painful crisis. Cognitive function, including impaired attention, is a particular problem in SCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and may be linked to sleep<bold>-</bold>disordered breathing and oxygen desaturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], as it is in the general population.</p><p>Treatment options for sleep<bold>-</bold>disordered breathing and nocturnal hypoxia include continuous overnight oxygen via a concentrator and continuous positive airways pressure (CPAP) but there are few data on their use in SCA. These two interventions commonly used to reduce overnight hypoxic exposure have different modes of action and there are some preliminary data available for each:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Positive Airways Pressure. CPAP therapy reduces sleepiness in adults and children with obstructive sleep<bold>-</bold>disordered breathing in the general population and may improve cognition and intermediate vascular endpoints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] but adherence is an issue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Auto<bold>-</bold>adjustable CPAP (APAP) is more comfortable as the pressure support is only triggered when the obstruction occurs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Positive Airways Pressure in SCA</italic> Positive airways pressure has been used short<bold>-</bold>term in SCA in acute chest crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and to prevent peri<bold>-</bold>operative complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. In unselected children with SCA in our 6<bold>-</bold>week proof<bold>-</bold>of<bold>-</bold>concept randomised controlled trial (RCT), overnight respiratory support with APAP was safe and feasible, with excellent adherence in all 12 participants in the treatment arm and no suppression of erythropoiesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Improvement in cancellation (Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC<bold>-</bold>
<sup>IV</sup>UK)), a measure of attention as well as processing speed, was seen in those on APAP compared with those not treated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Pain frequency, defined as the number of days that pain was experienced in a 2<bold>-</bold>week period, improved in the treatment arm (<italic>p</italic> = 0.07) but this did not reach statistical significance, perhaps related to reduced statistical power due to reluctance to complete paper pain diaries (full data was only available for 8 of the 12 participants in each arm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. As pain is the cardinal symptom in sickle cell disease, and is, therefore, an important endpoint in clinical trials, ensuring that all participants complete any diaries is important. With smartphone technology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], daily pain intensity and site may be explored in addition to frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], number of days in hospital [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] or number of admissions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Overnight oxygen is well<bold>-</bold>established for the treatment of hypoxia secondary to lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive airways disease in adults or bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Uncontrolled hypercapnia is a risk in settings where respiratory failure may occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Oxygen supplementation in SCA</italic> There are few data on the safety of oxygen administration in people with SCA and most data is available over short periods of time, typically in the management of acute crisis. The two main concerns in using overnight oxygen in SCA are the suppression of erythropoiesis and rebound pain, which has been documented with the administration of high flow rates of oxygen throughout 24<bold>-</bold>hour periods for several days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. However, reticulocytosis was documented in a child whose abdominal pain was relieved by 18 days placement within an oxygen tent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. In addition, erythropoietin levels did not fall in non<bold>-</bold>hypoxic adults randomised to receive oxygen during a painful crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Although the duration of painful crisis was not reduced by the administration of oxygen in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] or a paediatric trial designed to administer 50 % oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>], there was no evidence of rebound pain.</p><p>One report audited the use of long<bold>-</bold>term oxygen supplementation in SCA. Ip et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] described 6 adults with SCA (age range 20&#x02013;45 years; 4 women), who had been commenced on oxygen therapy (1<bold>&#x02013;</bold>2 l/minute) in the previous 2 years because of nocturnal hypoxia, defined as oxygen saturations &#x0003c; 90 % for &#x0003e; 30 % of the night. A detailed case notes review showed a mean increase in haemoglobin and reticulocyte count, with no change in erythropoietin and painful episodes.</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>There is a possibility that overnight respiratory support improves daytime lung function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>] and oxygen saturation. Both obstructive and restrictive lung disease have been reported in patients with SCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] and it is possible that there are physiological advantages for overnight oxygen or APAP, e.g. in improving daytime oxygen saturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] through improving gas exchange by overcoming upper or lower airway obstruction or increasing lung volume.</p><p>In addition to requiring additional safety data and exploring the physiological effects of overnight respiratory support, further work is needed to determine whether one of these alternatives is preferable to patients in terms of the inconvenience when compared with any possible benefits. To attempt to improve completion of diary data, the feasibility and acceptability of daily data collection on presence, site and severity of pain using a visual analogue scale for highest, pain and lowest daily pain using smartphone technology on an iPad mini (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) also requires assessment.</p><p>The National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) Research for Participant Benefit (RfPB) stream has funded our group to undertake a Phase 2 randomised 2<bold>-</bold>arm trial of overnight respiratory support or standard treatment. As there are very few pilot data involving treatment for sleep<bold>-</bold>disordered breathing in this condition, it is important to assess the acceptability of overnight oxygen supplementation compared with APAP in participants before deciding on which form of overnight respiratory support to use as the treatment arm in the Phase 2 trial. In the participants and public involvement (PPI) work for the RfPB submission, no participant preference came out between the proposed two interventions to help make a decision on which intervention to choose, but these participants did not have first<bold>-</bold>hand experience of using either device. This pilot phase is designed to examine patient preferences after 1 week of using each device in randomised order and will also determine whether there is evidence that either form of overnight respiratory support has a short<bold>-</bold>term beneficial or detrimental effect on haematological variables or lung function.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Aims and objectives</title><p>The aim of this pilot study (Prevention of Morbidity in SCA, POMS2a; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) is to ascertain which intervention (overnight oxygen or APAP) is more acceptable to participants by asking them to use both interventions for 1 week each, with each intervention followed by an in depth semi<bold>-</bold>structured qualitative interview. It will also assess the quantitative methodologies, which are to be used in the next larger trial (POMS2b, the Phase 2 trial).<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Protocol details</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Protocol title:</th><th colspan="2">Prevention of Morbidity in sickle cell disease 2a &#x02013; pilot phase (Improvement of Pain and Quality of Life in Participant with Sickle Cell Disease with Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy or Auto<bold>-</bold>adjusting Continuous Positive Airways Pressure: pilot phase)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Protocol number and date</td><td colspan="2">Protocol Version 8 5February 2014</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="6">Protocol chair/principal investigator:</td><td colspan="2">Fenella Kirkham MD FRCPCH</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Professor of Paediatric Neurology</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Institute of Child Health (University College London)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Office: 44 207<bold>-</bold>905<bold>-</bold>2968</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Fax: 44 207<bold>-</bold>833<bold>-</bold>9469</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">Email: fenella.kirkham@ucl.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="33">Protocol team/co<bold>-</bold>investigators:</td><td>Prof David Rees MD MRCP MRCPath</td><td>Dr Jo Howard MRCP FRCPath</td></tr><tr><td>Professor in Paediatric Haematology</td><td>Consultant Haematologist</td></tr><tr><td>King's College Hospital</td><td>Guy&#x02019;s and St Thomas&#x02019; NHS Foundation Trust</td></tr><tr><td>Tel: 0207 346 3242</td><td>Tel: 0207 188 2741</td></tr><tr><td>Fax 0207 346 4689</td><td>Fax 0207 188 2728</td></tr><tr><td>Email: david.rees@kingsch.nhs.uk</td><td>Email: jo.howard@gstt.nhs.uk</td></tr><tr><td>Dr Baba Inusa MB FRCPCH</td><td>Prof Swee Lay Thein</td></tr><tr><td>Consultant Paediatrician,</td><td>Professor of Molecular Haematology</td></tr><tr><td>Evelina Children&#x02019;s Hospital,</td><td>King&#x02019;s College Hospital</td></tr><tr><td>London SE1</td><td>Tel: 0207 848 5443</td></tr><tr><td>Tel: 020 7177 7177</td><td>sl.thein@kcl.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>Email: Baba.Inusa@gstt.nhs.uk</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Dr Christina Liossi</td><td>Dr Nicholas Hart</td></tr><tr><td>Senior Lecturer in Health Psychology</td><td>Consultant in Respiratory and Critical Care</td></tr><tr><td>University of Southampton</td><td>Guy&#x02019;s and St Thomas&#x02019; NHS</td></tr><tr><td>Tel: 02380594645</td><td>Foundation Trust</td></tr><tr><td>Fax</td><td>Tel: 0207 188 7608</td></tr><tr><td>Email: cliossi@soton.ac.uk</td><td>Email: Nicholas.hart@gstt.nhs.uk</td></tr><tr><td>Ms Carol Nwosu</td><td>Dr Man Ying Edith Cheng</td></tr><tr><td>Chief Executive Officer</td><td>Statistician</td></tr><tr><td>Sickle Cell and Young Stroke Survivors</td><td>University of Southampton</td></tr><tr><td>Suite R, 7th Floor, Hannibal House</td><td>Research Design Service</td></tr><tr><td>London UK</td><td>UK</td></tr><tr><td>Tel : 0844209292</td><td>Tel: 02380795704</td></tr><tr><td>Email: Carolnwosu@scyss.org</td><td>Email: m.y.cheng@soton.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>Associate Professor</td><td>Ms Maria Chorozoglou</td></tr><tr><td>Assistant Professor Paediatrics</td><td>Snr RF in Health Economics</td></tr><tr><td>Department of Nursing</td><td>Wessex Institute</td></tr><tr><td>University of California</td><td>Faculty of Medicine</td></tr><tr><td>Tel: 310 267 1823</td><td>University of Southamptom</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="3">Email: eufemia@sonnet.ucla.edu</td><td>UK</td></tr><tr><td>Tel : 02380597457</td></tr><tr><td>Email: M.Chorozoglou@soton.ac.uk</td></tr><tr><td>Study sites</td><td>Guy&#x02019;s and St Thomas&#x02019; NHS Foundation Trust</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap>

This will be assessed at the end of the 7<bold>-</bold>day intervention period. There is no such capability for the oxygen concentrators and the participant/carer will be asked to record the hours of use.

This is a pilot phase; all statistical analyses will be treated as preliminary and exploratory and will mainly be descriptive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>]. We will investigate factors that influence recruitment rate, acceptability, adherence and loss to follow<bold>-</bold>up. The variability of outcome measures will be reported and any indication of improvement on any of the treatment will be explored informally: e.g. daily pain rate from the smartphone app, admissions to hospital for complications and laboratory parameters. The decision will be made primarily according to participant preference and, if this is at equipoise, on any apparent physiological benefits, e.g. higher daytime oxygen saturations, improved lung function or rates of adverse events. The cost implications will be assessed and relative long<bold>-</bold>term costs to the NHS will be taken into account if there is still equipoise.</p><p>The study will be reported in accordance with the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) 2010 statement (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>) (or latest version if it is available at the time of reporting) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">55</xref>].

Patient and public involvement has been an integral part of this trial and the key outcome is qualitative and dependent on obtaining good quality data to advise on participant feasibility, acceptability and preference. This is being addressed by using a standard interview, which is carried out by a designated psychologist. The development of a pain endpoint is another important outcome and collecting daily measurements is likely to be challenging. This has been addressed by using smartphone technology via an iPad mini, which can connect to wireless networks but does not require a phone contract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>], which is cost<bold>-</bold>effective and should be easier for participants to complete. Assessment of the usefulness of this technology is important as the first outcome measure for the Phase 2 trial, POMS2b, will be average pain intensity during the 2 observation periods and we plan to use the same technology if this proves successful in the pilot. For this pilot study, we are including patients regardless of pain frequency and severity, although it is possible that patients with a significant burden of pain might have a different spread of preferences. In the Phase 2 trial there is a case for including only patients with chronic pain, screened with an appropriate questionnaire for burden of pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>]. The patient&#x02019;s experiences and acceptability of both interventions, and statistical evaluation of pain, adverse events, safety data and physiological data will all be taken into account to determine the most acceptable intervention. The most acceptable intervention will be used in the second phase of the larger proof<bold>-</bold>of<bold>-</bold>concept study (POMS2b).</p><p>A potential risk is that the participants and their families do not feel adequately supported to agree to recruitment or to continue in their allocated intervention. The sleep physiologist (who will not be blinded to the interventions) will provide easily accessible advice and support. She will routinely call the patient the day after the intervention has started but will also be available to answer additional question during the time of the intervention. Recruitment may also be a challenge but experienced clinical haematologists are co<bold>-</bold>applicants in order to maximise the chance of steadily recruiting participants who will commit to the study and also remember to complete the online pain score at daily bases. The team has experience of similar trials with the same group of participants, for which it has successfully recruited.</p><p>The findings from this pilot study will be disseminated to the scientific community, service users and policy<bold>-</bold>makers via submission to an Open Access peer<bold>-</bold>review journal. In addition the patient public involvement representatives are taking the lead to disseminate the findings to the service users.</p></sec><sec id="Sec23"><title>Trial status</title><p>The trial is still recruiting.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec24"><title>Additional files</title><p>
