It is characterized by deep painful nodules and abscesses that rupture and contribute to the formation of sinus tracks and scarring. The management of HS is based on the assessment of disease severity and a combination of medical and surgical treatment according to the European Guidelines. Adalimumab, a recombinant, fully humanized, anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (anti-TNF-&#x003b1;) monoclonal antibody, is the only officially approved treatment for the management of moderate-to-severe HS. Case reports, concerning 42 patients who received adalimumab for severe HS (with the standard dose regimen for psoriasis), reported a cumulative response rate of 58% (&#x02265;50% in 23 patients) with a relapse rate of 71% (10 out of 14 patients). The most recent and most well-powered phase III, randomized placebo-controlled trials for the evaluation of the efficacy and safety of adalimumab in treatment of moderate-to-severe HS (PIONEER studies I and II) showed that the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR) rate at week 12 was significantly higher for patients randomized to adalimumab compared to placebo. Adverse events were comparable to placebo. In conclusion, adalimumab, to date, holds the most robust data regarding treatment efficacy in HS. Larger, registry-based studies are needed to further establish the efficacy and safety profile of this anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agent in HS.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>hidradenitis suppurativa</kwd><kwd>adalimumab</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, recurrent, inflammatory skin disease that affects the hair follicles of the aprocrine gland-bearing anatomical areas of the body.<xref rid="b1-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is characterized by deep painful nodules and abscesses that rupture and contribute to the formation of sinus tracks and scarring.<xref rid="b2-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The axillae, inguinal, anogenital regions and mammary, and inframammary areas are the most commonly affected parts of the body.<xref rid="b3-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The diagnosis of the disease is based on the following findings: history of recurrent, painful, suppurating lesions in intertrigenous body areas for two or more times in 6 months.<xref rid="b2-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The exact prevalence of the disease is uncertain, though, it is believed that it ranges between 1% and 4%.<xref rid="b4-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Its estimated incidence &#x02013;

At week 8, 25% of patients had at least 50% reduction of HSSI from baseline, but this did not reach statistical significance versus placebo (primary efficacy outcome was not achieved).<xref rid="b51-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> However, 20%&#x02013;60% of patients, at week 8, reached a 25%&#x02013;50% improvement in HSSI which was statistically significant compared with placebo.<xref rid="b51-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> DLQI also showed considerable improvement.<xref rid="b51-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Recurrences occurred after discontinuation of treatment. In a retrospective comparative study with 20 HS patients (1:1), infliximab achieved a significantly greater improvement in mean Sartorius score (56%) compared with adalimumab (34%).<xref rid="b50-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> Infliximab was administered at 5 mg/kg intravenously at weeks 0, 2, and 6, while adalimumab was given at 40 mg sc every other week, which is not the recommended dose for HS.<xref rid="b50-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">50</xref> A very recent retrospective national cohort study, which included 67 patients who received anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agents for HS, concluded that adalimumab seems to be more effective than infliximab and etanercept in the treatment of severe HS.<xref rid="b52-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></p><p>Etanercept is a fusion recombinant protein, which fuses with the TNF receptor and interferes with TNF-&#x003b1; binding. According to several case reports, it has been administrated with a dose regimen of 25 mg sc twice weekly, in about 34 patients with encouraging outcomes.<xref rid="b2-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b53-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b54-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">54</xref> However, in the only randomized placebo-controlled trial on the use of etanercept in HS (n=20 patients), the dose regimen was 50 mg sc twice weekly for 3 months and there was no significant difference compared with placebo.<xref rid="b55-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></p><p>Ustekinumab (a human monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of IL-12/IL-23) in treatment of HS has been described in one case report with three patients.<xref rid="b56-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> The dose regimen used was 45 mg sc at weeks 0, 4, and 16. One of the three patients (33%) exhibited an improvement of &#x02265;50%.<xref rid="b56-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> However, it is too early to decisively conclude about the effectiveness of this biologic agent in psoriasis.</p><p>Anakinra is a recombinant form of the human IL-1 receptor antagonist that inhibits the biologic activity of IL-1&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;. It has been tried in several cases of severe HS. Initial sporadic case reports have produced contradictory outcomes, while an open-label study by Leslie et al has shown a satisfactory response (i.e. decrease of Sartorius score) in five out of six patients.<xref rid="b57-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b60-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> Recently, Tzanetakou et al conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with a very promising outcome.<xref rid="b61-ccid-9-367" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> It included 10 patients who received once-daily subcutaneous injection of anakinra 100 mg for 12 weeks and 10 controls. An HiSCR was achieved by 78% of patients in the anakinra group and by only 20% of patients in the control group. However, larger studies are needed in order to confirm these results.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In the era of evidence-based medicine and the new understanding of the inflammatory pathways that characterize HS, adalimumab, to date, holds the most robust data regarding efficacy in the treatment of the disease. Apparently, adalimumab can contribute to the optimal control of the inflammatory burden of the disease and hopefully in a second level could prevent scarring. However, future larger registry-based studies are needed to further establish the efficacy and safety profile of this anti-TNF-&#x003b1; agent in HS.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
