A PGE<sub>1</sub> analogue, misoprostol, is often utilized to alleviate NSAID-related gastrointestinal side effects. This study examined the effect of misoprostol on celecoxib renal toxicity. Additionally, the effects of these drugs on cardiovascular parameters were evaluated. Four randomized rat groups were orally gavaged for 9 days, two groups receiving vehicle and two groups receiving misoprostol (100 &#x000b5;g/kg) twice daily. Celecoxib (40 mg/kg) was co-administered once daily to one vehicle and one misoprostol group from days 3 to 9. Urine and blood samples were collected and blood pressure parameters were measured during the study period. Hearts and kidneys were harvested on final day. Day 2 urinary electrolyte samples revealed significant reductions in sodium excretion in misoprostol (0.12&#x000b1;0.05 &#x000b5;mol/min/100 g) and misoprostol+celecoxib groups (0.07&#x000b1;0.02 &#x000b5;mol/min/100 g). At day 3, all treatment groups showed significantly reduced sodium excretion. Potassium excretion diminished significantly in vehicle+celecoxib and misoprostol+celecoxib groups from day 3 onward. Urinary kidney injury molecule-1 levels were significantly increased in vehicle+celecoxib (0.65&#x000b1;0.02 vs. 0.35&#x000b1;0.07 ng/mL, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0002) and misoprostol+celecoxib (0.61&#x000b1;0.06 vs. 0.37&#x000b1;0.06 ng/mL, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0015) groups when compared to baseline; while plasma levels of cardiac troponin I increased significantly in vehicle+celecoxib (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0040) and misoprostol+misoprostol (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0078) groups when compared to vehicle+vehicle. Blood pressure parameters increased significantly in all misoprostol treated groups. Significant elevation in diastolic (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0071) and mean blood pressure (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.0153) was noted in misoprostol+celecoxib compared to vehicle+celecoxib. All treatments produced significant tubular dilatation/necrosis compared to control. No significant myocardial changes were noticed; however, three animals presented with pericarditis. Kidney, heart, and plasma celecoxib levels revealed no significant change between vehicle+celecoxib and misoprostol+celecoxib. Concomitant misoprostol administration did not prevent celecoxib renal toxicity, and instead exacerbated renal side effects. Misoprostol did not alter plasma or tissue celecoxib concentrations suggesting no pharmacokinetic interaction between celecoxib and misoprostol.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This study was funded by East Tennessee State University, Department of Pharmaceutical Sciences Faculty Startup Funds.

NSAIDs function through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase (COX), an enzyme necessary for prostaglandin (PG) formation. NSAIDs are categorized based on their specific mechanism of action. Non-selective NSAIDs, such as diclofenac and indomethacin, function to inhibit both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes; while COX-2-selective inhibitors (COXIBs), such as celecoxib and rofecoxib, function to inhibit only the COX-2 enzyme <xref rid="pone.0089087-Goodman1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Harirforoosh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Because of the highly efficient nature of NSAIDs, a large number of adverse gastrointestinal (GI) and renal side effects are associated with their usage. The most prevalent GI side effects include stomach bleeding, indigestion, and ulceration. Edema and electrolyte retention are the predominant NSAID-related renal side effects <xref rid="pone.0089087-Griffin1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089087-Wallace1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. It has also been found that individuals who present with cardiovascular (CV) complications may be at an increased risk of developing myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke, when undergoing prolonged NSAID therapy <xref rid="pone.0089087-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089087-Solomon2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>NSAIDs can produce toxic effects in both the GI and renal systems. Furthermore, several studies have established a link between COXIBs and CV adverse events <xref rid="pone.0089087-McGettigan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. COXIBs (e.g. celecoxib) were found to cause sodium retention by increasing the expression of Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>&#x02212;</sup> cotransporter (NKCC2) in renal tubules. Another transporter heavily involved in sodium regulation, Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA), may fluctuate with changing PG levels contributing to sodium retention <xref rid="pone.0089087-Feraille1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Kreydiyyeh1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. A decrease in urinary sodium excretion has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of CV events <xref rid="pone.0089087-ODonnell1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Whelton1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In a systematic review conducted by McGettigan and Henry, celecoxib was found to confer an overall increase in CV risk with doses exceeding 400 mg/day <xref rid="pone.0089087-McGettigan1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This dose-dependent relationship between celecoxib and CV risk was also uncovered in a meta-analysis by Solomon <italic>et al.</italic> which exhibited an increase in the relative risk of CV events as the daily dose of celecoxib increased from 400&#x02013;800 mg <xref rid="pone.0089087-Solomon2" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Misoprostol is a synthetic analogue of PGE<sub>1</sub> that has gained considerable attention as a powerful reactive oxygen species scavenger <xref rid="pone.0089087-Salam1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> showing strong anti-apoptotic and cytoprotective effects <xref rid="pone.0089087-Dajani1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Over the years, misoprostol use has been successful in the treatment of liver cell necrosis and intestinal cell apoptosis and has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of NSAID-related GI side effects <xref rid="pone.0089087-Salam1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089087-Topcu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. The gastroprotective effects of misoprostol were first described by Robert <italic>et al.</italic> in 1967, and have become the active standard against which newer gastroprotective interventions are tested. As such, misoprostol is commonly used for the prevention of deleterious GI side effects of NSAIDs such as diclofenac (a non-selective NSAID) <xref rid="pone.0089087-Tang1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Raskin1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Hawkey1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Misoprostol has also been found to affect the expression of NKCC2 <xref rid="pone.0089087-Gamba1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> through cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) regulation. NSAIDs consumption reduces PGE<sub>2</sub> levels through COX inhibition, which decreases cAMP expression, allowing for increased NKCC2 expression. Misoprostol has been shown to reverse the stimulatory effects of NSAIDs on NKCC2 expression <xref rid="pone.0089087-FernandezLlama1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of misoprostol on celecoxib-induced renal toxicity.

GPower 3.1, a software program which determines statistical power, was used to identify an appropriate study sample size. The effect size based on a previous study, which revealed a 65&#x000b1;25% (mean &#x000b1; standard deviation) sodium excretion decrease in rats treated with celecoxib, was 40% <xref rid="pone.0089087-Harirforoosh2" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Using an effect size of 0.4 and a power of 95%, the detection of a significant difference (p&#x0003c;0.05) in sodium excretion rate required a sample size of 24. Thus this study consisted of 4 groups (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;6).</p><p>Celecoxib or misoprostol was dissolved in a 0.5% methylcellulose solution and administered via gastric intubation. A significant change in electrolyte excretion has been previously reported with a celecoxib dose of 40 mg/kg/day <xref rid="pone.0089087-Harirforoosh3" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.

Interestingly, there have also been several studies that report the beneficial and protective effects of misoprostol consumption on CV disease formation, renal damage, and nephrotoxicity <xref rid="pone.0089087-Ozer1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Moran1" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Sonmez1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>. However, few studies have analyzed the CV and renal effects of concomitant administration of misoprostol with NSAIDs. Although the CV effects of select NSAIDs have been well documented <xref rid="pone.0089087-Davies1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Bombardier1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>, the current literature has reported conflicting evidence in regard to the CV effects of celecoxib <xref rid="pone.0089087-Bombardier1" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. This study was designed to investigate the influence of concomitant administration of misoprostol on renal adverse effects of celecoxib. In addition, we studied the effect of celecoxib alone or in combination with misoprostol on some CV parameters in rats.</p><p>Renal injury is known to initially manifest through a reduction in electrolyte excretion and total urine outflow <xref rid="pone.0089087-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>. In past studies, misoprostol has been shown to delay the nephrotoxic effects of NSAIDs in cirrhotic patients and maintain normal urinary excretion and electrolyte output <xref rid="pone.0089087-Antillon1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089087-Wong2" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>. In our present study, we investigated the effect of misoprostol on celecoxib induced renal impairment by measuring and comparing total electrolyte excretion between treatment groups. Misoprostol given at a dose of 200 &#x000b5;g/kg daily did not attenuate sodium retention when given simultaneously with celecoxib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Likewise, the rate of potassium retention was also unaffected by the addition of misoprostol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These findings suggest that misoprostol was unable to attenuate NSAID-induced electrolyte retention. Interestingly, no significant change in plasma electrolyte concentrations was observed among the treatment groups. These findings are reflective of the compensatory change in body hemodynamics brought forth by altered renal health. Various hormones such as aldosterone, renin, and angiotensin act to control and mediate the balance between total body electrolyte concentrations and plasma volume. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g004">Figure 4</xref>, aldosterone levels on day 10 were not significantly altered among experimental groups compared to control. Thus electrolyte balance is being maintained through another mechanism. Balance may be maintained through vasopressin and anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) alterations. When plasma becomes concentrated, ADH is secreted in response to increased plasma osmolarity <xref rid="pone.0089087-Hasegawa1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. Previous studies have shown that ADH release is controlled by osmatic stimuli brought forth from changes in total electrolyte balance <xref rid="pone.0089087-Hasegawa1" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Tanaka1" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref>. It is entirely possible that the results of our study, showing normalized plasma electrolyte balance, is a result of alterations in hemodynamic pathways involving ADH and other hormone cascades. The absence of a significant change in BUN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g005">Figure 5</xref>) in this experiment support previous studies which indicate that while nonselective NSAIDs produce sodium retention and a reduced glomerular filtration rate (GFR), COXIBs do not influence GFR <xref rid="pone.0089087-CatellaLawson1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>.</p><p>KIM-1 is a sensitive and robust urinary biomarker of acute renal injury <xref rid="pone.0089087-Vaidya1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. KIM-1 is a class 1 transmembrane cellular glycoprotein expressed by proximal tubule epithelial cells in the presence of injury or ischemia, including injury of drug origin <xref rid="pone.0089087-Hoffmann1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Chiusolo1" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>. Recent studies have shown a direct relationship between KIM-1 expression and symptomatic heart failure in patient populations. In one study, KIM-1 expression was increased in patients diagnosed with chronic heart failure <xref rid="pone.0089087-Jungbauer1" ref-type="bibr">[52]</xref>. Another study confirmed that an increase in KIM-1 levels predisposes elderly men towards an increased risk of heart failure <xref rid="pone.0089087-Carlsson1" ref-type="bibr">[53]</xref>. Lekawanvijit <italic>et al.</italic> also demonstrated a cardiorenal relationship for this biomarker, as evidenced by significant post-MI increases in KIM-1 expression in a rat model <xref rid="pone.0089087-Lekawanvijit1" ref-type="bibr">[54]</xref>. In our study, we looked at the possible attenuating effects of misoprostol when given in conjunction with NSAIDs on KIM-1 expression. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g003">Figure 3</xref>, concomitant administration of misoprostol with celecoxib did not attenuate NSAID induced KIM-1 expression. These findings suggest that misoprostol does not exhibit renal protection in the presence of celecoxib.</p><p>Troponin is a protein complex found in striated muscle, including cardiac muscle. cTnI and cardiac troponin T (cTnT) are indicators of cardiac muscle damage in humans <xref rid="pone.0089087-Sarko1" ref-type="bibr">[55]</xref>, and have also been useful in detecting cardiac damage in rats <xref rid="pone.0089087-OBrien1" ref-type="bibr">[56]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Bertinchant1" ref-type="bibr">[57]</xref>. In our study, we found significant increases in cTnI expression in groups treated with celecoxib on day 3 when compared to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These levels remained elevated through day 9. Misoprostol co-administration did not attenuate the elevation of cTnI expression to any significant degree. Interestingly, when rat blood pressure was measured on day 9, there was a significant rise in diastolic, systolic, and mean pressure in the misoprostol+misoprostol group when compared to vehicle+vehicle group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0089087-t003">Table 3</xref>). The influence of misoprostol on blood pressure can be explained by the renal vasoconstriction effect of misoprostol <xref rid="pone.0089087-Natov1" ref-type="bibr">[58]</xref>. Furthermore, when misoprostol was co-administered with celecoxib, these blood pressure parameters were further elevated. Diastolic and mean blood pressure were significantly elevated in the misoprostol+celecoxib group compared to both the vehicle+vehicle and vehicle+celecoxib groups. These findings suggest that celecoxib induces CV stress as evidenced by a rise in cTnI levels and blood pressure parameters. Our findings also suggest that misoprostol does not exhibit any cardioprotective effects in the presence of celecoxib, but may exacerbate celecoxib associated CV side effects.</p><p>Renal histopathological analysis provided insight into structural changes effected by drug administration. The relative sparing of glomeruli suggests that primary filtration is unaffected by celecoxib and changes in ion exchange likely occur at reuptake across the renal tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g007">Figure 7</xref>). As previously reported, administration of celecoxib produces tubular necrosis and dilatation <xref rid="pone.0089087-Kockaya1" ref-type="bibr">[59]</xref>. Concomitant misoprostol and celecoxib administration was discovered to exacerbate tubular necrosis. Similar damage intensification has been shown in a previous study in which celecoxib plus paracetamol worsened renal damage compared to celecoxib alone <xref rid="pone.0089087-Kumar1" ref-type="bibr">[60]</xref>. However, renal celecoxib levels were not increased in the presence of misoprostol. Thus, tubular damage does not appear to be directly correlated with renal celecoxib concentration. The renal adverse effect intensifying property of misoprostol will need to be weighed against the gastroprotective property conferred through concomitant administration, especially in cases of prior renal dysfunction.</p><p>Because misoprostol administration has presented with strong anti-apoptotic effects, renal apoptosis was quantified to account for renal damage <xref rid="pone.0089087-Topcu1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. As the TUNEL assay revealed no significant change in glomeruli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g009">Figure 9</xref>) nor tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g010">Figure 10</xref>), the renal toxicity observed in this study seems to occur primarily through necrotic cell death. The results of Caspase-3 immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g011">Figure 11</xref>) serve as a confirmation of the TUNEL results, as seemingly no change in abundance occurred between control and experimental groups.</p><p>In this study, rats presenting with pericarditis were grouped together and compared to all other celecoxib receiving rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g008">Figure 8</xref>). A student&#x02019;s t test of the two groups, pericarditis positive and negative, revealed no significant difference in celecoxib concentration between the groups (data not shown). As such, an alteration in celecoxib concentration does not appear to be responsible for the appearance of pericarditis. In humans, pericardial inflammation can arise as a result of drug induced damage, bacterial or viral infections, or MI; however, pericarditis may also be idiopathic in origin <xref rid="pone.0089087-Braunwald1" ref-type="bibr">[61]</xref>. A review of current literature shows no previous articles which have reported pericarditis associated with NSAID administration.</p><p>Sodium retention functions as a hallmark of NSAID-induced renal dysfunction <xref rid="pone.0089087-Whelton2" ref-type="bibr">[62]</xref>. PGE<sub>2</sub> reduces sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle <xref rid="pone.0089087-Brater1" ref-type="bibr">[63]</xref> via an activity reduction in NKCC2 <xref rid="pone.0089087-Kaji1" ref-type="bibr">[64]</xref>. In the absence of PGE<sub>2</sub>, through inhibition by NSAIDs, the presence of NKCC2 is increased; however, misoprostol administration has been shown to reduce the amount of NKCC2 <xref rid="pone.0089087-FernandezLlama1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. The absence of a significant NKCC2 abundance change in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g012">Figure 12</xref>) is supported by the antagonistic effects suggested by Fernandez-Llama et al <xref rid="pone.0089087-FernandezLlama1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In addition, the outcome of NKCC2 immunohistochemistry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g013">Figure 13</xref>) was in line with our western blotting results. These findings suggest that the particular electrolyte excretion change is orchestrated via another mechanism. In the absence of an increase in NKCC2 abundance, NKA was examined as a possible driver of sodium retention <xref rid="pone.0089087-Feraille1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0089087-Kreydiyyeh1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. No significant change in NKA protein levels was detected in this experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0089087-g014">Figure 14</xref>); however a change in transporter activity, not examined in this study, could act as a mechanism of sodium retention <xref rid="pone.0089087-Feraille1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. In previous studies, when given concomitantly with other drugs misoprostol has been shown to increase drug plasma concentrations significantly <xref rid="pone.0089087-Bennett1" ref-type="bibr">[65]</xref>. To test the possibility of drug-drug interactions between celecoxib and misoprostol, we examined drug concentrations of celecoxib in plasma and tissue samples. In this study, there was no significant difference in celecoxib concentrations between groups treated with vehicle+celecoxib as compared to groups treated with misoprostol+celecoxib (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0089087-t006">Table 6</xref>). These results indicate that plasma concentrations of celecoxib were not altered in the presence of misoprostol and that findings within our study were not a result of pharmacokinetic drug interaction between celecoxib and misoprostol.</p><p>There are several limitations to our study. We examined the cardiorenal side effects of celecoxib using a single daily dose of 40 mg/kg/day. At this dosage range we found significant correlation between electrolyte excretion, kidney and cardiac biomarker expression, and tissue necrosis in groups treated with celecoxib or misoprostol+celecoxib. However, the observed association between treatment groups and the accompanying side effects may not be conclusive since it was made using a single daily dose of our selected NSAID. Therefore, it is still unclear as to whether these effects where reached at the ascending or plateau stage of the drug exposure response curve. It is also important to note that our study focused extensively on NSAID-induced cardiorenal side effects in conjunction with misoprostol administration. The action of NSAIDs and misoprostol on NSAID-induced GI related events has been well documented <xref rid="pone.0089087-Satoh1" ref-type="bibr">[66]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0089087-Dajani2" ref-type="bibr">[68]</xref>. As such, GI side effects were not elucidated within the context of this study. Finally, although electrolyte excretion rates were measured, dietary intake of electrolytes was not measured in this study. Thus changes in excretion may result from differences in food intake elicited by drug side effects.</p><p>In conclusion, concomitant administration of misoprostol with celecoxib did not alter reduced electrolyte excretion induced by celecoxib in this study. No significant difference was noticed between the combined treatment of misoprostol and celecoxib on KIM-1 expression. Similarly, histopathological evaluation of kidney tissue also confirmed NSAID-induced tubular necrosis in both treatment groups. Interestingly, celecoxib-treated groups showed significantly elevated cTnI levels, suggesting celecoxib induced cardiac stress. Misoprostol did not lessen cardiac stress to any significant degree and actually showed increased cTnI levels when compared to control. These findings suggest that misoprostol does not attenuate NSAID-induced kidney damage and may exacerbate cardiac stress. As such, further studies are warranted to understand the role misoprostol and celecoxib may play in the onset of cardiorenal events. The results obtained within this study suggest that more research should be conducted in patients who receive misoprostol and/or celecoxib therapy to examine for signs of CV and renal related issues.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Gregory Hanley, Brian M.
