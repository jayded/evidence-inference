The aim of the study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of the use of Arthrum HCS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (40&#x000a0;mg hyaluronic acid and 40&#x000a0;mg chondroitin sulfate in 2&#x000a0;mL).</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and methods</title><p>This was an open, multicenter, prospective study. Men or women over 40&#x000a0;years of age with documented knee osteoarthritis and WOMAC subscore A (severity of pain)&#x000a0;&#x02265;25 were enrolled. They received three weekly intra-articular injections of sodium hyaluronate 2&#x000a0;% and chondroitin sulfate 2&#x000a0;% in combination. WOMAC subscore A was assessed at 1, 3 and 6&#x000a0;months after the last injection.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>One hundred and twelve patients were included (women, 66&#x000a0;%). The mean (SD) WOMAC subscore A decreased from 52.1 (15.2) at inclusion to 20.5 (19.7) at month 6 (<italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.0001).

Pain relief and consumption of analgesic drugs, both assessed with visual analogic scale (VAS), consistently decreased. The investigators were satisfied/very satisfied as regards the therapeutic effectiveness of sodium hyaluronate-chondroitin sulfate in reducing pain (77&#x000a0;%), improving mobility (78&#x000a0;%) and reducing the consumption of analgesics (74&#x000a0;%).

Knee pain has an important impact by limiting activity and impairing quality of life. Thus, knee osteoarthritis has been identified as one of the medical conditions (with stroke, depression, hip fracture and heart disease) accounting for more physical disability than other diseases in people 65&#x000a0;years of age or older [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Moreover, knee osteoarthritis has a major impact on healthcare costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The management of osteoarthritis should be hierarchical, with non pharmacological methods as first interventions (weight loss, exercise and braces), followed by analgesic drugs [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other analgesics], local therapies (topical NSAIDs, intra-articular corticosteroids and hyaluronic acid), and surgery as a last resort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p>Administration of exogenous hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation) directly into the joint is available as a treatment for the symptoms of knee osteoarthritis. The purpose of viscosupplementation is to overcome the qualitative and quantitative deficiency of hyaluronic acid that is associated with osteoarthritis. Hyaluronic acid is a polysaccharide that is the main constituent of cartilage and synovial fluid; it is responsible for the mechanical properties of the joint by allowing shock absorption, lubrication and cartilage protection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In osteoarthritis patients, synovial hyaluronate is depolymerized and is cleared at higher rates compared to normal subjects due to inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Intra-articular injections of hyaluronic acid have been shown to be as effective as NSAIDs with fewer systemic adverse events [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]; this therapy has a delayed onset of action in comparison with intra-articular corticosteroids, but a longer-lasting benefit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Younger patients and patients at an earlier stage of the disease are more likely to benefit from viscosupplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Arthrum HCS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (LCA Pharmaceutical, Chartres, France) is a new specialty for viscosupplementation combining sodium hyaluronate and chondroitin sulfate. Chondroitin sulfate&#x02014;a sulfated glycosaminoglycan&#x02014;is an important structural component of the extracellular cartilage matrix.</p><p>On the articular system, chondroitin sulfate links to monomers with high molecular weights. The proteoglycan aggregate exhibits viscoelastic and hydration properties and an ability to interact with the surrounding tissue through electric charges, leading to protection of the cartilaginous tissues. Furthermore, chondroitin sulfates are inhibitors of extracellular proteases involved in the metabolism of connective tissues and stimulate proteoglycan production by chondrocytes in vitro; they also inhibit cartilage cytokine production and induce apoptosis of articular chondrocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Preliminary clinical trials were in favor of the effectiveness of intra-articular injections of sodium hyaluronate-chondroitin sulfate. Thus, in a 3-month multicentric pilot study, a series of three weekly injections of a combination of hyaluronic acid-chondroitin sulfate was well tolerated and decreased pain in patients with knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. A recent clinical study suggested that a single injection of sodium hyaluronate-chondroitin sulfate in patients with lateral epicondylitis offer better pain benefits for 6&#x000a0;months after injection than intra-articular corticosteroids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In an exploratory study, the effectiveness of intra-articular injections of a solution combining hyaluronic acid and chondroitin sulfate was assessed in 40 patients with knee osteoarthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The clinical improvement, together with the changes of the ultrasound parameters and biomarkers of cartilage metabolism and joint inflammation, suggested a non-placebo effect. These results prompted us to assess in a prospective multicenter study the effectiveness and safety of the use of hyaluronic acid when combined with chondroitin sulfate in patients with knee osteoarthritis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was an open, multicenter, prospective study, assessing the effectiveness of three intra-articular injections of sodium hyaluronate plus chondroitin sulfate (40&#x000a0;mg of each compound in 2&#x000a0;mL) in the symptomatic treatment of knee osteoarthritis.</p><p>The study was conducted prospectively by office or hospital specialists (orthopedic surgeons, rehabilitation medicine physicians) from October 2012 to December 2013.</p><p>Written informed consent was obtained from each patient.

Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to assess the effectiveness and safety of injections of Arthrum HCS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> in a relatively large population of patients with knee osteoarthritis. We observed that the severity of pain assessed with the WOMAC subscore A decreased significantly from 52.1 to 20.5 at 6&#x000a0;months. The relief was already significant 1&#x000a0;month after the last injection. These results were confirmed by the assessment of pain relief and the decrease in the consumption of analgesics with VAS. Approximately three out of four investigators were satisfied/very satisfied as regards to the therapeutic effectiveness of the injections of sodium hyaluronate-chondroitin sulfate in reducing pain, improving mobility and reducing the consumption of analgesics.</p><p>The pilot study of Maheu et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] in 41 patients with femoro-tibial knee osteoarthritis also reported an improvement 3&#x000a0;months after three 2-mL injections of hyaluronic acid (12&#x000a0;mg/mL) plus chondroitin sulfate (30&#x000a0;mg/mL). The mean VAS score decreased from 61 at baseline to 29 after 3&#x000a0;months (60&#x000a0;% of patients reported an improvement above 50&#x000a0;%). Although the dosages of the compounds were slightly different, these results are consistent with those of the present study.</p><p>The very low proportion of patients with adverse events confirms the safety of viscosupplementation in knee osteoarthritis. The harmlessness of viscosupplementation in knee osteoarthritis has been confirmed in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized saline-controlled trials for US-approved intra-articular hyaluronic acid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. There were no statistically significant differences between hyaluronic acid and saline controls for any safety outcome.</p><p>It is now debated that surgical procedures in knee osteoarthritis should be avoided as far as possible or at least delayed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. The restoration of the viscoelasticity of the synovial fluid in order to protect cartilage, if possible during the early states of the disease, is an attractive therapeutic option. Moreover, a medico-economic evaluation showed that, together with clinical benefits, costs of knee osteoarthritis decreased after hyaluronic acid injections due to the decreased need for other treatments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. However no therapies have been shown to alter the natural history of osteoarthritis. In the absence of disease modifying osteoarthritis drugs, treatment of osteoarthritis is focused on controlling symptoms, especially pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Until prospective studies on the efficacy of hyaluronic acid on knee arthroplasty delay are completed, intra-articular treatment must be considered an additional non-operative strategy for relief of symptoms.</p><p>There are some limitations of the study. First, there was no control group. Indeed, there is a debate on the effectiveness of viscosupplementation in osteoarthritis, but some meta-analyses found an advantage of viscosupplementation over sham intervention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Therefore, it was difficult to justify a sham control in one group. Nevertheless, the kinetics of the effect observed in the present study conform to the conclusions of a meta-analysis on viscosupplementation that showed that effectiveness became significant at 4&#x000a0;weeks, peaked at 8&#x000a0;weeks and persisted for 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Another limitation was the absence of demonstration of the benefit of the addition of chondroitin sulfate to hyaluronic acid. With a comparable total number of patients, the statistical power of the trial would decrease with an additional treatment group (hyaluronic acid alone). This issue should certainly be addressed in further studies.</p><p>Arthrum HCS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> is a new intra-articular treatment combining in the same injection two compounds that are deficient in osteoarthritis. Chondroitin sulfate is an essential component of cartilage and is present also in synovial fluid. Our results suggest that intra-articular injections of Arthrum HCS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (sodium hyaluronate plus chondroitin sulfate) in patients with knee osteoarthritis allows a safe and effective control of pain. These results should be confirmed in a randomized controlled study.</p></sec></body><back><notes notes-type="conflict-interest"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>All authors received a consultancy fee reimbursement from LCA Pharmaceutical, Chartres, France, to contribute to completing this study.
