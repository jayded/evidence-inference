Whole grains have the potential to reduce CVD risk through improvements in circulating lipids including decreased total-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and triacylglycerols (TAG), and increased HDL-cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Although mechanisms for these effects are unclear, whole grain bioactive constituents such as dietary fiber, trace minerals, vitamins, lignans and phytochemicals may be potential contributors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p><p>Research suggests that processing techniques that prepare the whole grain for digestion and absorption may not remove their bioactive constituents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], therefore rationalizing the potential for breads made from whole grains to reduce CVD risk. Potential properties of whole grain breads such as sourdough fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and large grain particle size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>] may provide additional health benefits including increased mineral bioavailability and improved postprandial glycemic response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast, refined grains found in white breads, contain more available carbohydrate and less dietary fiber, both of which may increase postprandial glycemia and circulating TAG leading to increased CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>].</p><p>Despite epidemiological evidence to support a role for whole grains in reducing CVD risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], results of intervention studies are inconsistent. Although intervention studies have replaced refined with whole grain foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], those that measured serum lipids did not attribute changes to the whole grains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. However, these investigations had study design limitations such as inclusion of whole grain foods produced from milled flour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], use of a hypocaloric diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] and dependence on participants to self-select whole grain foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Further, although wheat was the dominant grain included [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>], it is not known whether effects were due to wheat or non-wheat whole grains. Giacco et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] addressed this by using only wheat products in a 3-week intervention of wholemeal wheat compared to refined wheat foods, which significantly decreased fasting total- and LDL-cholesterol in healthy adults. As well, other studies that have used less comprehensive interventions have demonstrated improved serum lipids following consumption of powdered wheat fibre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]; high-protein, high-fibre wheat flakes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]; and wheat whole grain and wheat bran cereal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Potential mechanisms behind these effects include decreased glycemia, insulinemia and lipoprotein particles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Studies that have focused on wheat breads have either not measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>] or found no significant effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] on serum lipids, prompting the need for more whole grain wheat bread interventions.</p><p>In addition to the use of traditional CVD biomarkers to investigate the impact of whole grains, it is of value to consider individual genetic variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), particularly the e missense mutations of the <italic>APOE </italic>gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] and those of the hepatic lipase gene promoter (<italic>LIPC</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>], are reflective of varying circulating lipid profiles and thus warrant study in relation to CVD risk assessment. In addition to dyslipidemia, these SNPs may also help identify additional isolated or combined CVD risk factors such as obesity and dysglycemia.</p><p>The purpose of the current study was to address the knowledge gap in whole grain wheat intervention studies by investigating effects of whole grain and refined wheat bread consumption on CVD risk while considering the influence of genetic variation. The primary objective of this dietary intervention was to determine the response to 6-week consumption of whole grain wheat sourdough bread in comparison to white bread, on fasted serum lipids and apolipoproteins, in healthy men and postmenopausal women of low and high levels of CVD risk. A secondary objective was to consider the influences of <italic>APOE </italic>and <italic>LIPC </italic>polymorphisms on the serum lipid responses to the bread treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Men and postmenopausal women (defined as absence of menstruation &#x02265; 1 y) aged 43-70 y, were recruited using posters and newspaper advertisements. Participants were initially screened using an eligibility questionnaire and excluded if they reported the presence of any serious medical condition (i.e. CVD, diabetes, cancer, hepatic disease, renal disease), frequent alcohol consumption (&#x02265; 2 drinks.d<sup>-1</sup>), use of lipid-lowering medication, use of hormone replacement therapy, use of daily aspirin, major body weight changes (&#x0003e; 5% of usual body weight within the last 6 months), current or planned attempts at trying to lose or gain weight, plans to alter their habitual lifestyle, elite athletic training or an allergy to gluten. Potential participants meeting these criteria then underwent an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) of 75 g dextrose (Trutol 75, NERL Diagnostics, RI, USA) to rule out diabetes (based on fasted and 2-h glucose) and to determine fasted and 2-h whole blood glucose and serum insulin. Potential participants were then considered eligible if they met the inclusion criteria of 1 of 2 groups representing different levels of CVD risk. Inclusion criteria for the normoglycemic/normoinsulinemic (NGI) group were: BMI 19-25 kg&#x000b7;m<sup>-2 </sup>and/or waist circumference &#x0003c; 102 cm for men and &#x0003c; 88 cm for women, and all of the following: normal fasted glucose (plasma glucose &#x0003c; 6.1 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>), normal glucose tolerance (2-h post-OGTT plasma glucose &#x0003c; 7.8 mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>), and normal fasted insulin (serum insulin &#x0003c; 90 pmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup>).

The daily number of slices of treatment bread provided was then calculated using the average grain serving CFG recommendation based on bread weight divided by the weight of the treatment bread slices (25 g/slice for whole grain wheat sourdough bread and 37.5 g/slice for white bread). Therefore, the number of slices provided to women and men, respectively, was 6 and 7 for whole grain wheat sourdough bread and 4 and 5 for white bread.

The study concurrently investigated 2 groups of participants that significantly differed in CVD risk and also considered genetic variation in response to the bread treatments through identification of gene polymorphisms related to CVD risk.</p><p>Although body measurements and glycemic endpoints were significantly different between the NGI and HGI groups at study entry, which established their metabolic distinction, they did not significantly differ between treatments, within either group. The lack of change in body measurements (body weight, BMI, body fat, waist circumference) suggests that participants followed their habitual diet and physical activity routines throughout the study to minimize potential confounding effects. Noteworthy is that the lack of change in body weight between treatment periods is consistent with previous similar studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. As expected though, during the study, consumption of the high-fiber whole grain wheat sourdough bread caused an increase in dietary fiber intake within both participant groups relative to the white bread. The whole grain wheat sourdough bread also caused an increase in MUFA intake, only within the NGI group, which is less obviously explained, but given the lack of significant difference in energy or other macronutrients, may be due to variation in food record analysis. Of note, participants were not counselled on the macronutrient distribution of their diet and the results show that their macronutrient intake distribution was comparable to that reported in Canadian nutrition surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>].</p><p>Fasting serum lipids, apolipoproteins and related ratios were not significantly affected by 6-week consumption of whole grain wheat sourdough bread (12.8-14.9 g dietary fiber/d; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>) in comparison to white bread (6.75-8.44 g dietary fiber/d; Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>), within either the NGI or HGI group. These findings are consistent with a study by Jenkins et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] in which serum total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol were not significantly affected by 4-week consumption of 2 high-wheat fiber breads (25 g dietary fiber/d) of varying wheat bran particle size compared to low-wheat fiber bread (6 g dietary fiber/d) in hypercholesterolemic adults, although the same study found that serum TAG were significantly reduced by both high-wheat fiber breads. Other related studies have also found significant lipid changes including reduced total-cholesterol:HDL-cholesterol following 2-week consumption of high-protein wheat flakes (21 g dietary fiber/d) in healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>], reduced total-cholesterol following 3-week consumption of wheat bran (13 g dietary fiber/d) and whole grain wheat (5.7 g dietary fiber/d) cereal in hypercholesterolemic adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and reduced total- and LDL-cholesterol following 3-week consumption of wholemeal compared to refined wheat food products in healthy adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>]. The most comparable participant group studied in relation to the current study's HGI participants is that of Sabovic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] who studied adults with dysmetabolic cardiovascular syndrome (defined by obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, dyslipidemia and arterial hypertension) and found significantly decreased total-, LDL- and HDL-cholesterol following 5-week consumption of wheat fiber supplements (21 g dietary fiber/d). It is possible that if the current study's HGI participants had more metabolic dysregularities like the Sabovic et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] participants, the wheat fiber in the whole grain wheat sourdough bread may have significantly influenced serum lipids. Overall, the inconsistent lipid results among the few whole grain wheat intervention studies completed to date highlights the need for further research.</p><p>The gene polymorphisms considered in the current study included 3 of the <italic>APOE </italic>gene (E2, E3 and E4) and 2 of the <italic>LIPC </italic>gene (-514C&#x0003e;T and -250G&#x0003e;A). Genotyping results revealed proportions consistent with the general Caucasian population for all 5 SNPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. When the influence of having the common <italic>APOE </italic>E3/E3 genotype was considered, results showed that the whole grain wheat sourdough bread significantly increased LDL-cholesterol in NGI participants (n = 7) and significantly increased TAG and TAG:HDL-cholesterol in HGI participants (n = 10). Although no other whole grain wheat intervention study has considered genetic variation, many other studies have examined the influence of <italic>APOE </italic>genotypes, particularly since the <italic>APOE </italic>allele variation can account for approximately 7% of the inter-individual variation in total- and LDL-cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. As reviewed by Ordovas et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>], <italic>APOE </italic>genotypes have primarily been studied in relation to dietary interventions of fat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>] and dietary fiber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. Most related to the current study, oat bran intervention studies of 2- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>] and 4- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] week durations have found significantly greater reductions in total- and LDL-cholesterol in those with the <italic>APOE </italic>E3/E3 genotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>] and in those who are <italic>APOE </italic>E2 allele carriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>], in comparison with wheat bran. The inconsistency of these results with those of the current study and the limited number of related studies confirm the need for continued consideration of nutrigenetics in dietary fiber-related intervention studies.</p><p>The finding of increased LDL-cholesterol following consumption of whole grain wheat sourdough bread in the NGI participants with the <italic>APOE </italic>E3/E3 genotype was unexpected and may be explained by a shift in utilization of glucose as a substrate for hepatic acetyl-CoA production. Although it is possible that the glucose sensing transcription factor carbohydrate response element binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>] may have influenced LDL-cholesterol in the <italic>APOE </italic>E3/E3 sample within the NGI group, this hypothesis was not tested in the current study.</p><p>The findings of increased TAG and TAG:HDL-cholesterol following consumption of the whole grain wheat sourdough bread in the HGI participants with the <italic>APOE </italic>E3/E3 genotype was also unexpected. Given that <italic>APOE </italic>genotypes are not commonly associated with effects on TAG or HDL-cholesterol, clear explanations for these findings are unconfirmed. Recently, however, Wood et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] demonstrated an interaction between the <italic>APOE </italic>and <italic>LIPC </italic>genes in their effect on plasma TAG in the general population. Therefore, a larger sample size in the current study may have allowed for detection of an interaction between the <italic>APOE </italic>and <italic>LIPC </italic>genes. Nonetheless, the results do suggest a modification in TAG metabolism within the HGI relative to the NGI group that is likely associated with their glycemic and insulinemic dysfunction.</p><p>The current study has both limitations and strengths that deserve mention. Although the consideration of genetic variation strengthened the current study, there was a limited ability to detect genotype-treatment interactions due to under-representation of the rare <italic>APOE </italic>and <italic>LIPC </italic>polymorphisms. This under-representation was in part due to retrospective genotyping, which although common due to the financial and labour constraints, causes further reason to interpret the results with caution. Also worth noting as a limitation is that particle size was not measured for either of the treatment breads. Strengths of the study include its randomized crossover design, and inclusion of not only the polymorphisms, but 2 participant groups of distinct CVD risk. Also, the study participants maintained their usual diet and since they were provided with the treatment bread, they were not required to self-select their whole grain products, which may help to minimize potential confounding variables. Furthermore the direct comparison of whole grain wheat to refined wheat bread adds clarity to the wheat literature in ascertaining the difference in health effects between whole grain and refined foods.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, this study uniquely compared whole grain wheat to refined wheat bread and considered the influence of individual CVD risk and genetic variation on serum lipid response. Participants were not counselled on the macronutrient distribution of their diet and their intake was comparable to that reported in Canadian nutrition surveys [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. Results showed that 6-week consumption of whole grain wheat sourdough bread did not significantly affect serum lipids in comparison to white bread, in adults of either a low or high level of CVD risk. When genetic variation was considered, albeit limited by retrospective assessment, it was found that in those with the <italic>APOE </italic>E3/E3 genotype, whole grain wheat sourdough bread unfavourably increased LDL-cholesterol in NGI participants, and TAG and TAG:HDL-cholesterol in HGI participants, when compared to white bread. These data add to the limited literature of intervention studies examining whole grain wheat relative to refined wheat breads and emphasize the need to consider genetic variation in relation to lipoprotein lipid content and CVD risk.</p></sec><sec><title>List of abbreviations</title><p><bold>ANCOVA</bold>: analysis of covariance; <bold>CFG</bold>: Canada's Food Guide; <bold>CVD</bold>: cardiovascular disease; <bold>g&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup></bold>: grams per liter; <bold>LIPC</bold>: hepatic lipase gene promoter; <bold>HOMA-IR</bold>: homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance; <bold>HGI</bold>: hyperglycemic/hyperinsulinemic; <bold>mmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup></bold>: millimoles per liter; <bold>ng&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup></bold>: nanograms per liter; <bold>NGI</bold>: normoglycemic/normoinsulinemic; <bold>pmol&#x000b7;L<sup>-1</sup></bold>: picomoles per liter; <bold>SNP</bold>: single-nucleotide polymorphism.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>AJT co-coordinated the participant recruitment and data collection, worked on the sample and statistical analysis, summarized the results and worked on the manuscript preparation.
