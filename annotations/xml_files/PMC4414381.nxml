Therefore, we conducted the present study in which twelve female goats were randomly assigned to either a treatment group fed a HG diet (60% grain, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) or a control group fed a low grain diet (LG; 40% grain, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6) for 6&#x000a0;weeks. Catheters were installed in the mesenteric, portal and hepatic veins, as well as one femoral artery of the goats, for determining blood flow and net clearance rate of LPS in the liver. Plasma and tissue samples were collected in the week 6 for analyzing pro-inflammatory cytokines, acute phase protein and biochemical parameters, as well as expression of genes involved in immune response.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p>HG diet feeding increased blood flow and LPS concentration in the portal vein, hepatic vein and artery. Hepatic net LPS clearance showed that HG diet feeding elevated the rate of hepatic LPS clearance, but decreased the percentage of removed LPS accounting for the total entry of LPS into the liver. Our results demonstrated that the feeding of HG diet increased plasma concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and acute phase proteins and triggered a systemic inflammatory response. In addition, peripheral blood plasma concentrations of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase and total bilirubin were increased in the HG group compared to the LG group. This indicated that the impairment of hepatocytes occurred after 6&#x000a0;weeks of HG diet feeding. The expression of genes involved in immune response and Toll-like receptor (TLR)4 protein in the liver was up-regulated in the HG group compared to the LG group, indicating that increased entry of LPS enhanced hepatic immune defence responses and contributed to hepatic inflammatory responses.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>These results provide insight into the capacity of the liver to clear LPS. The increased entry of LPS into liver enhanced hepatic immune defence responses, thereby elevated the rate of LPS clearance. However, the reduction of the percentage of hepatic LPS clearance could be due to the formation of hepatocyte lesion during HG diet feeding.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>High grain diet</kwd><kwd>Lipopolysaccharide</kwd><kwd>Immune gene expression</kwd><kwd>Liver</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Ruminants are fed a high grain diet to support high milk yields or induce rapid weight gain in modern animal husbandry. However, the long-term consumption of high grain diet is harmful to the health of ruminants. It has been reported that the feeding of high grain diet resulted in reduced pH values and increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) concentrations in the digestive tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. These changes cause local inflammatory responses of digestive tract and injury to the gastrointestinal barrier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which facilitates the translocation of LPS from the digestive tract into the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Many studies have demonstrated that increased circulating LPS cause a systemic inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Acute phase proteins (APPs), such as serum amyloid A (SAA), haptoglobin (Hp) and LPS-binding protein (LBP), are biomarkers for the diagnosis of inflammation and infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. An increase of SAA and Hp concentrations in the peripheral blood of cows fed a high proportion of grain diet showed that a systemic inflammatory response was activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The concentration of LBP in peripheral blood is an important indicator for systemic inflammation caused by circulating LPS. An increase of plasma LBP concentration in a grain-induced subacute ruminal acidosis (SARA) experimental model indicated that LPS translocated from the digestive tract into the bloodstream to elicit a systemic inflammatory response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In addition, the increased levels of circulating LPS also can elevated the concentration of blood pro-inflammatory cytokines (interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-&#x003b1;). A recent study showed that the concentration of pro-inflammatory cytokines was significantly increased in an LPS intra-mammary infusion experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The feeding of a high concentrate corn straw diet also resulted in increased pro-inflammatory cytokines in mammary arteries caused by the translocation of LPS from the digestive tract into the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Experimentally-induced endotoxic shock demonstrated that the liver is a major contributor of inflammatory cytokines in the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Circulating LPS entering the liver is recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4, which is expressed on the surface of Kupffer cells (liver macrophages) and other immune cells, to orchestrate the synthesis and secretion of cytokines and chemokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Subsequently, those cytokines can activate intracellular signalling pathways between immune cells and hepatocytes to regulate hepatic APP synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The synthesis of SAA and Hp was enhanced in primary bovine hepatocytes in response to stimulation with recombinant human pro-inflammatory cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Intravenous or intramammary infusion of LPS is frequently used in an <italic>Escherichia coli-</italic>induced mastitis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], where expression of cytokines and APPs was significantly increased in the liver of experimental animals. However, the production of excessive cytokines in the liver can cause functionally- impaired hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>It is well known that the liver is the main site for clearance of circulating LPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], and these hepatic removing mechanisms have been well documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The significant increase in LPS concentrations in the bloodstream during feeding with high grain diet has received increasing attentions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, few investigations have reported on the rate of hepatic LPS clearance and the percentage of removed LPS accounting for the total entry of LPS into liver. Furthermore, little information is available regarding hepatic immune responses induced by the increased entry of LPS into the liver during the feeding of high grain diet. Therefore, we hypothesized that feeding a high grain diet to goats resulted in the increased entry of LPS into liver, thereby enhanced hepatic immune defence response heightening the rate of hepatic LPS clearance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The experimental design and sampling procedures were approved by the Nanjing Agricultural University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee before the beginning of this experiment.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals, diets and experimental design</title><p>Goats were housed in individual metabolic cage in the Centre of Experimental Animal at Nanjing Agricultural University (Nanjing, China).

Although this feeding practice can enhance economic efficiency in the short-term, the feeding of HG diet leads to the translocation of LPS from the digestive system into the circulating blood. In an experiment conducted by replacing 21% of dry matter from a total mixed ration control diet with pellets containing 50% wheat and 50% barley, LPS concentration in the peripheral blood were significantly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Other studies showed that feeding a diet containing 60% concentrate to lactating goats or feeding cattle with 70&#x000a0;g grain/kg body weight elevated blood LPS concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Moreover, an <italic>in vitro</italic> study by Emmanuel <italic>et al.</italic>, showed five fold increased of the permeability of the rumen wall when this tissue was bathed in pH&#x000a0;5.5 solution, which promoted the translocation of LPS across the rumen wall [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and Chin <italic>et al.</italic> found that LPS induced cell apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cell lines, disrupted tight junction proteins and enhanced epithelial permeability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. <italic>In vivo</italic> studies in which high grain diets were fed to goats caused ruminal and caecal mucosal injury as well as colonic epithelial barrier disruption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Taken together, these breaches contribute to the translocation of harmful compounds, such as LPS and histamine, released in the digestive tract into the portal vein occurs during HG diet feeding. In the present study, the feeding of HG diet increased LPS concentrations in circulating blood, especially in the portal vein. In addition, LBP was directly involved in the clearance of LPS in the blood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Therefore, an increase of LBP in the peripheral blood of goats fed HG diet support the translocation of LPS from the digestive tract into the bloodstream [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Alterations of blood flow in response to dietary changes have been reported in previous studies. In a study by Reynolds <italic>et al.</italic>, an increase of dry matter intake significantly increased blood flow in the portal vein and liver of heifers fed 75% alfalfa diet or 75% concentrate diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], although the significant difference of blood flow between both diets was not obtained. In present study, the increase of blood flow in the portal vein, hepatic vein and artery indicated that the feeding of HG diet resulted in accelerated blood flow. In addition, it is known that blood flow is affected by body weight, our study observed that the average value of body weight did not change through this experiment. These findings suggest that the feeding of HG diet can promote blood flow entering or exiting the liver, and the increased entry of LPS into the liver through the portal vein. In addition, these findings also demonstrate that the rate of hepatic LPS clearance was significantly increased, but that the percentage of hepatic removed LPS was decreased during HG diet feeding.</p><p>There has been increasing attentions on inflammatory responses triggered by HG diet feeding in recent years. Acute phase response (APR) is the early stage of a systemic inflammatory response and was shown in a number of studies investigating the effects of the alterations of the grain proportion in the diet on the health of ruminants. During APR, the concentration of APPs in circulating blood is increased remarkably, and thus, SAA and Hp are often used as inflammatory markers in cattle. Determination of the serum SAA and Hp concentrations demonstrated that Hp but not SAA was notably increased when a diet administered to steers was switched from 0% concentrate diet to 61% concentrate diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. And when this proportion of concentrate was further increased to induce SARA, a rumen metabolic disorder, the serum concentration of SAA was also elevated. These studies confirm another study that also showed that serum concentrations of SAA and Hp were increased when cows received a HG diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Similar results for serum SAA and Hp levels were observed in a study by Khafipour <italic>et al.</italic>, where LBP plasma concentrations were also increased in this experimental model by increasing the grain percentage of the diet to induce SARA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. In the present study, concentrations of SAA, Hp and LBP in peripheral blood were markedly increased, suggesting that feeding the HG diet to goats causes an systemic inflammatory responses.</p><p>In addition, we also observed that HG diet feeding elevated plasma concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-1&#x003b2;, but did not affect plasma IL-6 concentrations. The increase in blood pro-inflammatory cytokines also provides evidence for the translocation of LPS and activation of inflammatory responses. The liver is an important immune organ where foreign antigens from the digestive tract encounter the immune system, and immune cells (mononuclear phagocytes) are activated to synthesize or secrete cytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Thus, during the feeding of HG diet, an increased entry of LPS into the liver via the portal vein probably stimulates Kupffer cells (liver macrophages), the major cytokine-producing liver cells, to release cytokines that subsequently enhance the secretion of APPs from hepatocytes.</p><p>Excessive production of cytokines in the liver can damage hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. The biochemical parameters ALT, AST, ALP, T-PRO, ALB and T-BIL in peripheral blood are common indicators used to assess the status of liver function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. In particular, ALT is a specific parameter that reflects hepatocyte damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. In the present study, increased plasma concentrations of ALT, ALP and T-BIL suggested that feeding the HG diet resulted in the breach of hepatocytes releasing those parameters into circulation. In previous studies conducted by Scott <italic>et al.</italic>, hepatocytes were shown to be critical for clearance of circulating LPS in the liver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Thus, the impairment of hepatocytes during HG diet feeding could contribute to the decreased percentage of LPS clearance in the liver.</p><p>There are few studies reporting changes of immune gene expression in the liver in response to variation in diet. The current study showed that HG diet feeding enhanced the expression of many genes involved in immune response, including TLR4, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines and APPs. Although other hazardous substances in blood and in digesta that can <italic>be translocted</italic> into circulating blood, LPS is thought to be the major contributor to the induction of synthesis of APPs and cytokines in the liver. An early study demonstrated that expression of cytokines and APPs in the liver was up-regulated during LPS intra-mammary gland infusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The liver is continually exposed to small amounts of LPS translocated from the digestive tract through the mesentery vein directly into the liver via the portal vein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. However, the increased concentration of LPS in the portal vein during HG diet feeding in the present study might explain why the enhanced immune gene expression and subsequent inflammatory response in the liver.</p><p>Recognition of inflammatory stimuli by the innate immune system is orchestrated by pattern recognition receptors that recognize external stimuli such as pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and internal stimuli (damaged associated molecular patterns) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. LPS, a well known PAMP, binds to LBP and activates the TLR4-signaling pathway resulting in the production of IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and TNF-&#x003b1;. These pro-inflammatory cytokines play an important role in orchestrating the synthesis of APPs as well as the secretion of other cytokines and chemokines. In our study, the increase of TLR4 and LBP expression in the liver confirmed that the TLR4 signalling pathway was activated by LPS translocated from the digestive tract into the circulating blood. Moreover, the feeding of HG diet elevated the level of mRNAs encoding for the chemokines IL-8, CCL5 and CCL20 in the liver. All these chemokines trigger diapedesis of polymorph nuclear granulocytes, mononuclear cells, macrophages and T-cells through the endothelia of blood vessels into the hepatic inflamed site. Furthermore, expressions of SAA and Hp were also up-regulated in HG group in the present study. Both SAA and Hp have major roles in the innate immune system by opsonising pathogens and removing the potential toxic substances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>].</p><p>The general understanding is that a severe local inflammation in peripheral tissues can lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1&#x003b2;, IL-6, TNF-&#x003b1;) and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>] as well as APPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">52</xref>] in the liver. In accordance with previous studies, feeding HG diet to goats resulted in injury to the gastrointestinal barrier and local inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], which might be the cause of the up-regulation of immune genes in the liver. In addition, the reduction of the percentage of hepatic LPS clearance during the feeding of HG diet indicated the accumulation of LPS in systemic circulation. This condition contribute to further explain the conclusion of recent study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>] in which feeding high-starch diets to cows have successful induced subacute ruminal acidosis, which caused the endotoxin tolerance in the mammary gland of cows and suppressed the response of mammary gland to LPS challenge.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Results obtained in the present study suggest that the feeding of HG diet results in increased blood flow and LPS concentration in the hepatic vein, portal vein and artery, thereby increasing the rate of hepatic LPS clearance, but decreased the percentage of removed LPS accounting for the total entry of LPS into liver. The increase in the rate of hepatic LPS clearance could be due to enhancement of hepatic immune defence response to synthesize and secret cytokines and APPs, and the reduction in the percentage of hepatic LPS clearance might be caused by impaired hepatocytes elicited by the increased entry of LPS into the liver via the portal vein. Overall, our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the effect of the feeding of HG diet on hepatic LPS clearance and immune responses. Future work should focus on the regulation mechanisms of immune relevant gene expression, such as epigenetic modulations, to further elaborate etiology of liver inflammation elicited by the feeding of HG diet.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>LPS</term><def><p>Lipopolysaccharide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TLR</term><def><p>Toll-like receptor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SARA</term><def><p>Subacute ruminal acidosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>p</italic>AH</term><def><p><italic>para</italic>-aminohippuric acid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IL-1&#x003b1;</term><def><p>&#x02212;1&#x003b2;, &#x02212;6, Interleukin-1&#x003b1;, 1&#x003b2;, &#x02212;6</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TNF-&#x003b1;</term><def><p>Tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>APR</term><def><p>Acute phase response</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>APPs</term><def><p>Acute phase proteins</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAA</term><def><p>Serum amyloid A</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Hp</term><def><p>Haptoglobin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>LBP</term><def><p>Lipopolysaccharide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>Alanine aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AST</term><def><p>Aspartate aminotransferase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T-PRO</term><def><p>Total proteins</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALB</term><def><p>Albumin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>T-BIL</term><def><p>Total bilirubin</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALP</term><def><p>Alkaline phosphatase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RT-qPCR</term><def><p>Real-time quantitative PCR</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>None of the authors has any financial or personal competing interests that would have influenced the content of the paper or interfered with their objective assessment of the manuscript.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>GC carried out the most of measurements of parameters in this study and drafted the manuscript, KZ prepared the blood and the liver samples, TX and DJ contributed to the statistical analyses, XS and SZ together conceived the idea, and designed the experiment.
