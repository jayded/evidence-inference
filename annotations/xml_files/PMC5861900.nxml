Frailty confers an increased vulnerability to adverse health outcomes and mortality in response to stressors (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Of note, the frailty syndrome is driven mostly by biological aging processes that include inflammation and stem cell dysfunction, as opposed to chronological aging (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref>). Early intervention may improve quality of life, reduce hospitalizations, and nursing home costs (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Therefore, it is increasingly important to recognize the clinical onset of frailty, and to develop effective therapeutic strategies.</p><p>There are two main models used to define frailty (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>): The deficit and the physical phenotype model. The deficit model accounts for a person&#x02019;s geriatric syndromes, diseases, psychosocial, physical, and cognitive impairments, and combines them to create a &#x0201c;Frailty Index&#x0201d; (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). The physical phenotype model consists of the identification of at least three factors: weight loss, exhaustion, weakness, slowness, and decreased physical activity, which together comprise an underlying state of multisystem dysregulation (<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Despite the use of different criteria for evaluating frailty, both models show evidence that the prevalence of the syndrome increases with age and is higher among women (9.6%) than men (5.2%) (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In a study of over 44,000 community-dwelling elderly adults, the overall prevalence of frailty was found to be 10.7% (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>).</p><p>Currently, several multimodal interventions are employed to manage frailty, namely resistance/aerobic exercise, caloric support, vitamin D, and optimization of polypharmacy (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). However, there are no specific medical or biologic treatments that ameliorate or reverse frailty (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Stem cell depletion is a key mechanism postulated to contribute to frailty (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref>). In this regard, we recently conducted a phase I open label study of human allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (allo-hMSCs) intravenously infused for frailty, which showed that the cells could be safely administered, improved measures of functional capacity, and reduced inflammation (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). Therefore, we conducted the current phase II double-blinded and placebo-controlled study in order to test the hypothesis that exogenous allo-hMSCs could reverse signs and symptoms of frailty in older individuals. Similar approaches have been shown to exert beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, with functional improvements on various types of heart disease (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;20</xref>), endothelial function (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>), and systemic inflammation (<xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>). Given their pleiotropic mechanisms of action, which include antifibrotic, anti-inflammatory, proangiogenic properties (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>), and their ability to stimulate endogenous progenitor cells (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), we hypothesize that their use may offer a novel treatment strategy in frail patients.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="s1"><title>Methods</title><p>The Allogenei<italic>C</italic> Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells in Patients with Aging F<italic>RA</italic>il<italic>T</italic>y via Intraveno<italic>US</italic> Delivery (CRATUS) study (#NCT02065245) is a phase II, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of allo-hMSCs delivered intravenously (IV) in frail individuals to test the safety and efficacy of allo-hMSCs in reducing markers of inflammation and improving markers of physical and mental functioning and quality of life (<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>).</p><sec id="s2"><title>Study Design, Stem Cell Procurement and Randomization</title><p>The study design and phase I of the CRATUS study have been recently published (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>).

The results support the safety and feasibility of administering allo-hMSCs in this population. With regard to efficacy, there was a preferential effect towards improvement of functional capacity and patient reported outcome measures in patients receiving lower dose MSCs, although immunologic bioactivity was evident with both doses. Together, these findings suggest that allo-hMSCs may be an effective biological modifier of aging frailty, and support ongoing investigation of allo-hMSCs alone or as an adjunct to current physical training strategies for aging frailty.</p><p>These findings are in agreement with a recently completed dose-finding phase I safety study (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In that study, two important sets of observations were made. First, a constellation of physical performance measures improved with cell therapy, and second, 100M cells represented the peak responsiveness dose, with a plateau and/or reduction in efficacy being noted with 200M cells. Accordingly, this study was based, in part, on phase I. Importantly, randomizing patients in a double-blind fashion to 100M cells, 200M cells, or placebo was performed to validate the results of the earlier study and to confirm both the constellation of physical performance findings and the dose&#x02013;response.</p><p>The findings here replicate in large part the results of the earlier open label study, support the concept that MSCs have bioactivity against aging frailty, and confirm the fact that 100M represents a superior dose level compared to 200M. The reasons underlying the inverse dose relationship noted here remain incompletely understood. The 100M dose group produced significant improvements in both physiologic and immunologic markers of frailty, while the high dose group solely demonstrated positive immunomodulatory effects. It is important to note that there is a precedent for this in earlier studies, and a number of stem cell-based clinical trials exhibit greater effects with lower doses (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). However, the available preclinical and clinical evidence regarding dose relationship in stem cell therapy is conflicting (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>), with some studies reporting that lower cell dosage and/or infusion cell concentration may provide the most benefit (<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), while others finding either a direct or nonlinear relationship (<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>).</p><p>There are several factors that could contribute to nonlinear dose response curves with cell-based therapy. These include variation in functional activity of the cells rather than the absolute number of cells infused. In this regard, higher cell concentrations could impair cell activity through physical effects such as concentration-dependent cell aggregation, or damage of cells due to excessive shear forces on cells during infusion that could influence the relationship between cell dose and clinical benefit (<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>). Therefore, studies have recently been focusing on cell activity and or genetic modification to enhance their activity, rather than quantity (<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>). However, as with all progenitor cell types in various disease processes, whether modified or not, exact dosing has yet to be established, and thus is a weakness of this particular study. Given the novel use of MSCs in frailty, a patient population for whom a successful therapy has yet to be developed, dosing was based on safety as established by previous studies (<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>) and phase I (<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>), and was further investigated in the current study. Importantly, safety was ultimately established in both cell-dose groups. The optimal effective dosing will be investigated in future larger randomized trials.</p><p>In the current study, we employed allo-hMSCs, which can target two pathways implicated in the pathogenesis of aging frailty&#x02014;inflammation and stem cell depletion. The current findings support the idea that biological modification of aging frailty is not only feasible but has the potential to meaningfully impact the physical performance of older individuals with mild to moderate. It is noteworthy that the effects on inflammatory cytokines may have practical value by providing a clinical useful biomarker. Importantly, both circulating TNF-&#x003b1; levels as well as B-cell intracellular TNF-&#x003b1; appear to be candidate biomakers that could be used to index the efficacy of hMSCs in this patient population.</p><p>The 6MWT, SPPB-questionnaire, FEV1, and the CHAMPS-questionnaire were among the physical performance measures examined in our study, and the 100M-group in particular produced a meaningful outcome in all measures. The 6MWT was originally designed to evaluate cardiac and pulmonary disorders; recently, its application has expanded to assess an individual&#x02019;s exercise capacity at various levels of intensity and their ability to walk safely in a community setting (<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Similarly, the SPPB is a physical measure utilized to identify an individual&#x02019;s future risk of disability, institutionalization, and mortality in the elderly adults (<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). CHAMPS was created to improve physical activity in the elderly (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). The survey utilizes a series of questions to measure physical activities which are then employed to estimate caloric expenditure per week (<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>). Together with measures of pulmonary function, these factors are of great importance in an individuals&#x02019; ability to remain mobile and active in a community setting. Other quality of life measures included sexual function. Although males did not experience any improvement in erectile dysfunction, women significantly improved their scores on the SQOL in the 100M-group. This is a particularly meaningful marker of improved quality of life, as loss of libido in postmenopausal women is intrinsically linked to hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD), a disorder marked by clinically significant personal distress (<xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>).</p><p>Frailty in advancing age is associated with a heightened state of inflammation termed &#x0201c;inflammaging&#x0201d; (<xref rid="CIT0042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). Markers of chronic inflammation, such as TNF-&#x003b1; and leukocytosis, are all associated with aging and age-related diseases (<xref rid="CIT0043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>). TNF-&#x003b1; in particular has been correlated with increased mortality in the elderly adults (<xref rid="CIT0044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>). MSCs harbor immunomodulatory properties and have been shown to decrease inflammatory markers in several studies (<xref rid="CIT0045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>). Therefore, it is not surprising that both the 100M- and 200M-cell doses significantly modulated the immune systems of the treated participants. Serum TNF-&#x003b1; was significantly reduced in the 100M-group, while B cell intracellular TNF-&#x003b1; was reduced in both the 100M- and 200M-groups, and as compared to placebo. Furthermore, there was a suppression of the late/chronically activated T-cells (CD25) at 6 months postinfusion. The 200M-group produced clinically significant decreases in markers of early and late/chronic T-cell activation. Most interestingly, allo-hMSCs significantly reduced the percentage of CD8 T-cells. The risk for infection is increased in aging and is marked by a CD4/CD8 ratio less than one (<xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Six months post-allo-hMSC treatment, there was a significant improvement in the immune risk phenotype of the 200M-group. These immune responses due to MSCs are likely to contribute salutary effects and could enhance health span in individuals with aging frailty.</p><p>Aging is characterized by a diminished reserve in all organ systems, with impaired stem cell production and/or function being implicated as contributing to the body&#x02019;s inability to repair itself (<xref rid="CIT0047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>). Chronic inflammation in particular is not only associated with frailty, but also creates a detrimental environment for stem cells and their ability to oppose disease processes (<xref rid="CIT0048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>). Currently, most research on frailty has focused on improvements on physiologic reserve, with a focus on the dysregulation of inflammation (<xref rid="CIT0049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>). Utilizing young healthy individuals as donors for hMSCs, this study addresses both physiologic and inflammatory aspects of aging frailty.</p><p>This study is limited by a small sample size. The lack of differences between groups, with the exception of intracellular TNF-&#x003b1;, is due to the study&#x02019;s small size which limits statistical power. Of note, the point estimate between the 100M-group and placebo in the physical performance metric 6MWD would require 30 patients per group for appropriate statistical power to detect a difference between groups. A future larger study is planned to address this.</p><p>In summary, the present study indicates that intravenous allo-hMSC delivery is safe in individuals with aging frailty. Given this excellent safety profile coupled with promising indications of efficacy in the 100M cell group, pivotal clinical trials are warranted to further establish the efficacy of allo-hMSCs in this multisystem disorder, to define optimal dosing of MSCs in this population, and to validate the use of inflammatory biomarkers as a useful surrogate of clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>Supplementary data is available at <italic>The Journals of Gerontology, Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences</italic> online.</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by The Soffer Family Foundation and The Starr Foundation.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>J.M.H. has a patent for cardiac cell-based therapy; he holds equity in Vestion Inc.; maintains a professional relationship with Vestion as a consultant and member of the Board of Directors and Scientific Advisory Board; and is a shareholder in Longeveron LLC.
