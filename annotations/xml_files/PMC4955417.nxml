In groin hernia repair, recurrence is the most important aspect of the complications. Factors attributed to complications and recurrences vary. In 1994, Wright in his analysis of thirteen recurrences over a 16-year period attributed technical errors and infections to play a role.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] In addition, Grosfeld and others elaborated factors contributing to recurrences in congenital inguinal hernia repair to include postoperative wound infection, haematoma, injury to the floor of the inguinal canal and usage of inappropriate suture materials.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] While Steinau <italic>et al</italic>. in their report found out that, about 31% of total recurrences were due to concomitant diseases and incarceration with 9.4% as a result of postoperative complications.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] However, Vogels <italic>et al</italic>. in their series of herniotomy in boys gave an overall recurrent rate of 0.69% that was attributed to inadvertent opening of the hernial sac during its dissection off the vas and vessels and larger size of the hernia.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>In our series, with a total of 2 (1.55%) recurrence rate, there were a total of seven 7 (5.31%) tearing of the processus vaginalis that were easily identified during the surgery and taken care of and such tearing had no adverse effect on the integrity of the repair. Eight postoperative haematoma 8 (6.15%) where seen mostly in groups RO and ST with surgical site infection to constitute 12 (9.27%) of the total postsurgery complication which is in keeping with reports from African set ups[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] where surgical site infection prevails.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Postoperative hydrocele was seen in three patients 3 (2.34%) that resolved spontaneously in two patients within 5-7 weeks from the date of surgery while a patient had an aspiration via scrotal approach without further recurrence.</p><p>On the other hand, the repair of congenital inguinal hernia and/or hydrocele varies. Ravi and Hammer searched for a standard technique for a repair of congenital inguinal hernia and hydrocele in children. They found out that, there are only trends rather than a standard uniform approach.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] While in 2002, Levitt[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] and colleagues surveyed 70% of North American Paediatric Surgeons and found out that, only 9% of the respondents do not incise the external oblique aponeurosis at all. In addition, only 22% of the surgeons surveyed applied a single ligature to the hernial sac and 34% were not twisting the sac. The authors attributed tradition of learning from mentors to have contributed more to surgeon's surgical method of repair rather than prevention and avoidance of anticipated complications. Hence, the majority of surgeons surveyed were incising the external ring, twisting and doubly ligating the sac. Reasons for the external ring incision, twist and double ligation of the sac were unclear, suggesting that; the practice may have originated from surgical mentorship.</p><p>In sub-Saharan Africa, congenital surgical pathologies are carried to adulthood due to the deficit of paediatric surgeons in rural and semi-urban hospitals and anterior abdominal wall defects inclusive.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] In our series, adolescents and adult patients with a history of congenital groin hernia/hydrocele were included with subsequent herniotomy in keeping with the work of Osifo and Irowa[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] without any postoperative sequalae.</p><p>Altogether, 37 (26.86%) complications were recorded in this study throughout the follow-up period. One (1) case of recurrence (1.55%) was recorded in each of groups RO and ST, with none recorded in other groups. Wound infection was recorded in 12 patients (9.27%) with 5 (3.93%) seen in group RO, 4 (3.07%) in ST, 1 (0.69%) in DL and 2 (1.58%) in SL. Haematoma formation and postsurgery induration were seen in 6 (5.71%), 3 (2.30%), 3 (2.08%) and 2 (0.79%) patients in groups RO, ST, DL and SL, respectively. Postsurgery hydrocele was recorded in 2 patients (1.57%) in group RO and 1 patient (0.77%) in group ST only.</p><p>Therefore, when the external aponeurosis was not opened, the sac not twisted and proximal sac singly ligated instead of double ligation, the mean operation time was reduced and postoperative pain management was also reduced [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Hernia repair in children with opening the external oblique aponeurosis, twisting the hernia sac and doubly ligating it has no any positive effect on the quality of the repair or reduction of complications. This is not only unnecessary but is a waste of time and resources with increased postoperative pain.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sachs</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Damm</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Encke</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Historical evolution of inguinal hernia repair</article-title><source>World J Surg</source><year>1997</year><volume>21</volume><fpage>218</fpage><lpage>23</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">8995083</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Skoog</surname><given-names>SJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Conlin</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Pediatric hernias and hydroceles.
