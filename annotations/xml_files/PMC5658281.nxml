<bold>WHAT IS THE CURRENT KNOWLEDGE ON THE TOPIC?</bold>
</p><p>&#x02611; Naloxegol is a peripherally acting &#x000b5;&#x02010;opioid receptor antagonist for the treatment of OIC. Both 25 and 50 mg of naloxegol was statistically significant over placebo in a phase II study, but adverse events with increased frequency and severity were observed in the 50 mg dose cohort.</p><p>
<bold>WHAT QUESTION DID THIS STUDY ADDRESS?</bold>
</p><p>&#x02611; This study supported the highest dose to be tested in phase III studies during the phase III study planning stage.</p><p>
<bold>WHAT THIS STUDY ADDS TO OUR KNOWLEDGE</bold>
</p><p>&#x02611; Based on the simulated trials, the distribution of mean difference from placebo significantly overlaps between the 25 mg and 37.5 mg dosing groups, suggesting that there would be little utility to using both the 25 mg and 37.5 mg dose levels in a single study.</p><p>
<bold>HOW MIGHT THIS CHANGE DRUG DISCOVERY, DEVELOPMENT, AND/OR THERAPEUTICS?</bold>
</p><p>&#x02611; This model prospectively defined dosing regimens for naloxegol, which was demonstrated to be effective in the later conducted phase III studies.</p></sec></boxed-text>

</p><p>During the design of the phase III trials, the US Food and Drug Administration recommended that the primary efficacy endpoint for the pivotal phase III efficacy studies should be the response rate and not the increase in SBMs from baseline, as evaluated in the phase II study. The primary endpoint in the pivotal studies based on response rate was to be multifactorial, ensuring patients had to demonstrate a clinically relevant improvement in SBM frequency, which was durable and maintained across the 12&#x02010;week treatment period. To be considered as a responder, patients had to have &#x02265;3 SBMs per week with at least 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 of the 12 treatment weeks and for 3 of the last 4 treatment weeks. The phase II data were re&#x02010;analyzed using response as an efficacy endpoint, in which response was defined as having at least 3 SBMs/week and at least 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 3 of the first 4 weeks of treatment. This paper presents application of modeling and simulation during naloxegol development to (1) develop a population exposure&#x02010;response model to quantify changes in response rate and dropout rate upon dosing with naloxegol, and (2) predict response rate and dropout rate in patients taking 12.5 mg/day, 25 mg/day, and 37.5 mg/day of naloxegol that can be used to support dose selection in the phase III studies.</p></sec><sec id="psp412229-sec-0002"><title>METHODS</title><sec id="psp412229-sec-0003"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>The clinical results of the phase II study (Study 07&#x02010;IN&#x02010;NX003) were reported previously.<xref rid="psp412229-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Briefly, this was a double&#x02010;blind, randomized, placebo&#x02010;controlled, multiple&#x02010;dose, and dose&#x02010;escalation study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of naloxegol in patients with OIC. Patients with confirmed OIC entered a 1&#x02010;week, single&#x02010;blind, placebo run&#x02010;in period, followed by 4 weeks of randomized double&#x02010;blind treatment with naloxegol or placebo. Randomization was stratified based on the total daily opioid dose at baseline. The doses of naloxegol were originally scheduled to be 5 mg, 25 mg, 50 mg, and 100 mg once daily with about 54 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio of active: placebo within each cohort. However, upon review of safety data from the 50 mg cohort, a decision was made not to continue with the fourth dose cohort at 100 mg. Eventually 208 patients were randomized and 207 patients were evaluated in 3 cohorts. The studies were approved by local ethics committees and were performed in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients.</p><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was a change in SBMs per week from baseline to the end of week 1 of the double&#x02010;blind treatment period. An SBM was defined as a bowel movement that occurred without the use of a rescue laxative within the previous 24 hours. Baseline SBMs per week were determined during the 2&#x02010;week run&#x02010;in period. Model development was based on the modified intention&#x02010;to&#x02010;treat population, defined as patients who were randomized and received at least one dose of double&#x02010;blind study treatment, had a baseline value, and evaluable data at week 1 of the double&#x02010;blind study period. A patient was defined as a responder if he had &#x02265;3 SBMs per week and &#x02265;1 SBM change from baseline for at least 3 of 4 weeks. Response rate was then calculated as the number of responders in a particular treatment group divided by the number of modified intention&#x02010;to&#x02010;treat patients in that group.

Exposure&#x02010;response analysis of the phase III data demonstrated that the 12.5 mg dose could provide a clinical benefit over placebo with comparable efficacy to the 25 mg dose.<xref rid="psp412229-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> In combination with clinical drug&#x02010;drug interaction results, the physiologically based pharmacokinetic models reasonably predicted naloxegol exposure when coadministered with CYP3A and/or P&#x02010;gp modulators and provided comprehensive dosage recommendations for naloxegol.<xref rid="psp412229-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> The current analysis demonstrated another modeling and simulation application of naloxegol to define/select appropriate doses for critical phase III studies, which resulted in a positive outcome.</p><p>Model simulations supported observations in the phase II study that the increased dose of naloxegol leads to an increased response rate for every week during the study of 4 weeks (<bold>Figure</bold>
<xref rid="psp412229-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). It was also demonstrated that naloxegol achieved the efficacy as measured by the SBM response at week 1 and efficacy stayed in the similar range over the 4&#x02010;week treatment period for both the 25 mg and 50 mg dose groups.The 5 mg dose group did not result in a larger response than the placebo (<bold>Figure</bold>
<xref rid="psp412229-fig-0001" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). In addition, the higher dose of naloxegol was associated with a higher rate of dropout compared with the lower doses. The observed response rate in the 25 mg dose cohort (69%) was quite high and similar to that observed in the 50 mg dose cohort, however, the final model predicted the response rate in the 25 mg dose cohort was about 50%. In the 25 mg dose group, the actual dropout rate was very low (3.4%; <bold>Table</bold>
<xref rid="psp412229-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref>) relative to the other groups resulting in a high observed response rate. The model predicted that the dropout rate for the 25 mg dose group to be 16.7% resulting in the lower predicted response rate. This prediction was based on the dropout model that integrated information from all cohorts and is likely to be more predictive.</p><p>The high dropout rate (&#x0223c;30%) in the 50 mg dosing group in the phase II study suggested that 50 mg was not appropriate to be tested in the phase III studies. Whether a dose between 25 mg and 50 mg should be tested was a question during the design of a phase III study. The model predicted that 25 and 37.5 mg doses would produce median response rates of 50.0% and 60.0%, respectively. But considering large overlap in the prediction range (<bold>Figure</bold>
<xref rid="psp412229-fig-0003" ref-type="fig">3</xref>), the differences of response rates between placebo and naloxegol&#x02010;treated subjects were not significantly different among these dose groups. Considering the 37.5 mg dosing group would have higher dose related dropouts, the 25 mg dose was recommended as the highest dose to be tested in phase III studies.</p><p>The modeling and simulation were performed prior to conducting two phase III studies, and predictions were further confirmed with clinical observations in these two phase III studies. Because most of protocol&#x02010;defined study/treatment discontinuation occurred in the first 3 weeks due to adverse events, it was assumed that the hazard will remain constant after the first 4 weeks. This assumption allowed us to translate our inference into the phase III study design (i.e., the responder rates at 4 weeks would be predictive of the responder rates at 12 weeks). Thus, dose selections were based on dose response analysis of a 4&#x02010;week endpoint, which was assumed to be correlated with a 12&#x02010;week endpoint. In the simulation of dose response based on the phase II data, accounting for dropout, the difference of response rates between 12.5 mg (40%) and 25 mg naloxegol (50%) was about 10% (<bold>Table</bold>
<xref rid="psp412229-tbl-0003" ref-type="table-wrap">3</xref>). In the phase III studies, the difference of response rates between the 12.5 and 25 mg groups was similarly small, 3% and 5%, respectively.<xref rid="psp412229-bib-0011" ref-type="ref">11</xref> The observed response rates in the phase III studies at 12.5 and 25 mg were lower but in a similar range as those predicted by the model (35% and 41% in the studies vs. 40% in model simulation for 12.5 mg and 44% and 40% vs. 50% for 25 mg). This is expected because the response rates from the phase III studies were obtained over a longer duration (12 weeks vs. 4 weeks in the simulation) and, hence, would have higher dropout rates because droupouts were considered as nonresponders, as well as because the criteria for the definition of a responder were more stringent than those used in this simulation. Responders in the phase III studies were defined as &#x02265;3 SBMs per week with at least 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for at least 9 of the 12 treatment weeks and for 3 of the last 4 treatment weeks compared to &#x02265;3 SBMs per week with at least 1 SBM/week increase over baseline for 3 of the 4 treatment weeks in the model simulation.</p><p>In conclusion, a naloxegol response and dropout model was developed and confirmed to be predictive of the redefined response rates observed in the phase II trial. The model was used to recommend the highest dose used in the phase III studies. The model predictions of the difference in response rates between 12.5 mg and 25 mg of naloxegol were consistent with the results of phase III studies and supported the approval of both naloxegol doses in the United States and in the European Union.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="psp412229-sec-0009"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>N.A.&#x02010;H., H.X., D.Z., S.A., and K.H.B. wrote the manuscript.
