Here, we determined the postnatal trajectory of VA storage and metabolism in major compartments of VA metabolism&#x02013;plasma, liver, lung, and kidney from postnatal (P) day 1 to adulthood. We also investigated the response to supplementation with VARA, a combination of VA and 10% all-<italic>trans</italic>-retinoic acid that previously was shown to synergistically increase retinol uptake and storage in lung. Nursling pups of dams fed a VA-marginal diet received an oral dose of oil (placebo) or VARA on each of four neonatal days: P1, P4, P7, and P10; and again as adults. Tissues were collected 6 h after the final dosing on P1, P4, P10, and at adult age. Gene transcripts for <italic>Lrat</italic> and <italic>Rbp4</italic> in liver and <italic>Raldh-1</italic> and <italic>Raldh-3</italic> in lung, did not differ in the neonatal period but were higher, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05, in adults, while <italic>Cyp26B1</italic>, <italic>Stra6</italic>, megalin, and <italic>Raldh-2</italic> in lung did not differ from perinatal to adult ages.

The activity of VA depends on the oxidative metabolism of retinol to form retinal and retinoic acid (RA). RA functions as the most active metabolite of VA by activating nuclear transcription factors that regulate the expression of several genes, including several that are involved in the metabolism of retinol, known as retinoid homeostatic genes. VA deficiency (VAD), which may manifest in clinical deficiency or marginal states of low retinoid status, is a common form of micronutrient malnutrition affecting preschool-age children and pregnant women worldwide [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. VA supplementation of young children is promoted by The World Health Organization as a means to reduce young child mortality [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Nonetheless, there are still significant gaps in understanding VA metabolism in the neonatal period. In view of the involvement of VA in a wide variety of physiologic and metabolic systems, newborns and neonates may have a need for a higher rate of retinol oxidation and RA formation to support their rapid growth and the differentiation of tissues. However, the actual biological requirements for VA in this age group are not known.</p><p>Recently, we conducted studies of retinol kinetics, using a mathematical modeling approach in neonatal rats [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], in which we compared two groups of neonatal rats, an oil-treated placebo group nursed by dams fed VA-marginal diet, and thus resembling infants of mothers with low VA status, and neonates that were supplemented with a combination of VA and RA, known as VARA. This combination contains VA given at a dose per body weight that is similar to VA given as a supplement to young children [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], plus a small portion, 10 mol-% of RA, which we previously showed increases, by approximately 5-fold, the uptake of retinol and the storage of retinyl ester in neonatal rat lung [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Thus, VARA could be an interesting means of increasing lung retinoid status. Although our previous studies on VARA supplementation focused on the lung [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], there currently is no integrated view of retinoid homeostatic gene expression that includes the plasma, liver, lung, and kidney throughout the neonatal period. The roles of these tissues may differ, or overlap. Thus, our objectives in the current studies were to determine the natural ontogenic development of retinoid homeostatic gene expression in the neonatal to adult periods, and to understand the response of these major organs to VARA supplementation, at neonatal and adult ages. Plasma is important for distributing retinol between all other tissues through the binding of retinol to retinol-binding protein (RBP). The liver esterifies retinol using the enzyme lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT), thus storing VA as retinyl ester; it also oxidizes retinoids, and synthesizes RBP. The lung is a prototypical extrahepatic VA target tissue that not only stores VA as retinyl ester but also is capable of producing RA and catabolizing retinoids. The kidney is the major site of RBP uptake by megalin, a multi-ligand receptor that functions to conserve and recycle retinol [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. In the present study, we have quantified retinol concentrations and retinoid homeostatic gene expression, with and without VARA supplementation, during the period of postnatal development (i.e., normal ontogeny, from birth to adult age) in each of these tissues in order to understand which components of this homeostatic system are responsive to VARA supplementation, and when. We also wanted to learn whether treatment of neonates with VARA has any long-term impact (&#x0201c;carry over effect&#x0201d;) at adult age. Thus, our study addresses three questions: 1) Is there a natural ontogenic progression of tissue VA and retinoid homeostatic gene expression in the neonates of mothers fed VA-marginal diet, and in adults fed VA-marginal diet from weaning? 2) Does VARA supplementation given periodically during the neonatal period affect the expression of retinoid homeostatic genes, either transiently or in a cumulative manner? 3) Does VARA supplementation of neonates have a long-term consequence on retinoid homeostatic gene expression in adults? Together, our results demonstrate significant developmental changes in the levels of some retinoid homeostatic genes, while not others, and reveal that neonatal VARA supplementation results in both short-term changes, and, for certain genes, a prolonged effect that is evident in the adult animal.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods and Materials</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Animals, diet and experimental designs</title><p>The Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee of The Pennsylvania State University approved animal procedures for care and use. Rats were housed in a room maintained at 22&#x000b0;C with a 12:12-h dark-light cycle, and food and water were freely available. A VA-marginal (VAM) purified diet (0.35 mg retinol equivalents/kg diet, AIN-93G diet prepared by Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] was fed to mating adult Sprague-Dawley female and male rats. After mating, pregnant dams maintained VAM diet in order to reduce the transfer of VA in milk from mother to pups during lactation in order to mimic the physiological state of low VA status observed in human populations [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. At birth, pups were randomly assigned to age of observation (P1, P4, P10, and adult) and treatment groups, VARA or placebo (canola oil). The neonatal ages of observation were selected to represent the pre-, early, and mid-septation stages of postnatal lung development. As shown in <xref rid="pone.0145924.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>, on the day of dosing (P1, P4, P7, P10 and 2 months), each pup received a single oral dose delivered directly into the mouth via a small micropipette, as previously described [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].

Weaned and post-weaned rats were fed the same VAM diet as mother. Rats were euthanized 6 h after final VARA or placebo treatment at randomly assigned age. Therefore, at P10, pups would have received an oral treatment at P1, P4, P7, and 6 h prior to tissue collection at P10 for a total of 4 treatments. Animals used to analyze VARA neonatal carry over effect in adult rats received oral dose at neonatal ages mentioned above (P1, P4, P7, and P10), but not prior to euthanasia as an adult.</p><fig id="pone.0145924.g001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0145924.g001</object-id><label>Fig 1</label><caption><title>Experimental design and total retinol concentrations in plasma, liver, and lung of neonatal rats to adult-age rats fed VAM diet supplemented with or without VARA.</title><p>Experimental design and treatment schedule (1A), and total retinol concentrations in plasma (B), liver (C), and lung (D) of control (oil-treated) neonates nursed by dams fed vitamin A marginal (VAM) diet, oil placebo) and VARA supplemented rats at postnatal day (P)1, P4, P10 and adult age.

Although our primary interest was the lung, due to previous studies suggesting a benefit of RA or VARA on this tissue during alveolarization, we wanted to understand VARA supplementation in the larger context of several retinoid homeostatic organs. Thus, our studies including plasma, liver, lung and kidney, under the same experimental conditions, were designed to provide this context. The results of this study provide insight into VA homeostasis during the period of postnatal development, and suggest that supplementation with VARA, when administered to animals with marginal VA status, may influence their retinoid homeostatic gene system acutely, and also may have longer-term effects which can be observed as differences in the level of gene expression in adult animals that received VARA only as neonates. As our intention was to compare results at different ages and in responses to VARA supplementation, on both retinol concentrations and several genes in several tissues, numerous comparisons are of interest and, therefore, for convenience, we have summarized our main findings in <xref rid="pone.0145924.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>. Several inferences or conclusions can be drawn from these results. First, based on the results of plasma, lung, and liver total retinol concentrations, the marginal VA status of the neonatal and adult rats in this study was confirmed (<xref rid="pone.0145924.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Interestingly, of these 3 tissues and although a VAM diet was fed to all rats after weaning, lung total retinol concentration increased (denoted as &#x0201c;higher&#x0201d; in <xref rid="pone.0145924.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) approximately 4-fold between neonatal (P10) and adult age. However, at the same time, the liver retinol concentration did not increase. This suggests that the lung has some priority for the uptake of retinol from plasma, as compared to liver. It is well known that VA is necessary for lung development [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The low levels of VA in neonatal lung tissue could be due to increased utilization of retinoids for growth and postnatal alveolarization processes [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref025"

were significant age-related developmental patterns in the expression of retinoid homeostatic genes, mostly driven by differences that occurred between neonatal age and adult age. Our objective was to examine the patterns of expression of retinoid homeostatic genes in major VA storage/homeostatic organs (lung, liver, and kidney) throughout postnatal development, in rats nursed by dams fed VAM diet. As mentioned previously, we selected rats fed VAM diet for this study as a model for human population at risk for VA deficiency [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our results indicate that each of the genes examined&#x02013;<italic>Lrat</italic> (VA storage in liver and lung), <italic>Stra6</italic> (VA uptake in lung), <italic>Rbp4</italic> (VA trafficking from liver to plasma), megalin (VA recycling from plasma), <italic>Raldh -1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic>, and <italic>-3</italic> (RA production from retinal), and <italic>Cyp26A1/B1</italic> (RA terminal oxidation and degradation)&#x02013;is expressed throughout the neonatal period. However, none of these changed significantly during the neonatal period (P1 to P10). However, interestingly, <italic>Rbp4</italic> in liver, <italic>Lrat</italic> in both the liver and lungs, in addition to <italic>Stra6</italic>, and <italic>Raldh -1</italic> and <italic>Raldh -2</italic> in lungs, all displayed a developmental pattern of expression with a significant increase in adult rats compared to neonates. Therefore, retinol trafficking, storage, uptake, and retinoic acid production are not only dependent on dietary status but also on age. Neonates are constantly growing and therefore do not maintain a metabolic steady state; as a result, VA among other nutrients is in constant demand for proper development [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Even though the VA status of the neonatal and adult rats in our study was marginal, the expression of <italic>Rbp4</italic> and <italic>Lrat</italic> mRNAs in liver and of <italic>Lrat</italic> mRNA in lung increased from neonatal to adult age. These results suggest that VA tissue accumulation through <italic>Lrat</italic> is dependent on both diet and age [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. They may also suggest that adults, who have a lower basal metabolic rate than neonates, are able to conserve dietary VA more efficiently and thereby are able to accumulate retinol in tissues, such as the lungs, even when the intake of dietary VA is below normal levels. Hence, for this reason, the amount of VA in the VAM diet may actually meet the biological requirement for VA in the adult animal, and that any excess VA is stored.</p><p>Thirdly, VARA supplementation significantly increased the concentration of retinol in plasma, liver, and lung. These results were anticipated based on previous findings in neonatal rats [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and mice [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], but no previous studies had addressed the effect of neonatal VARA supplementation on retinoid homeostasis in the adult animal. Here, we examined the possible effect of VARA supplementation on retinoid homeostatic gene expression at several times during the neonatal period, and in adults that had received VARA supplementation either acutely (6 h before tissue collection) or solely as neonates. Liver total retinol was higher, which was not unexpected as the amount of VA in VARA was based on an amount of VA given to children as a supplement that has been shown to reduce the rates of morbidity and mortality for 4&#x02013;6 months [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. VARA may thus be anticipated to result in significant storage of VA in the liver. <italic>Rbp4</italic> expression in the liver of neonates was significantly decreased after oral VARA supplementation. Previous studies of acute treatment with RA, or synthetic retinoids, have shown a reduction in RBP4 and retinol in plasma [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. <italic>Lrat</italic> and <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> expression levels were directly correlated with VA and RA availability through VARA supplementation in both neonatal and adult liver (<xref rid="pone.0145924.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). <italic>Rbp4</italic> expression in the liver of neonates was significantly decreased after oral VARA supplementation (<xref rid="pone.0145924.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145924.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Previous studies have shown that oral treatment with RA increased <italic>Lrat</italic> and <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> expression in adult rat liver [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Our results show similar effects of VARA supplementation on <italic>Lrat</italic> and <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> expression in both adult and neonatal liver, with <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> expression exhibiting the greatest increase (denoted as &#x0201c;markedly higher&#x0201d; with &#x02265;100 fold increase in <xref rid="pone.0145924.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Although the secretion of <italic>Rbp4</italic> is tightly regulated by the availability of retinol [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], our results suggest a significant decrease in neonatal <italic>Rbp4</italic> expression levels after VARA supplementation. These results support previous findings of a significant reduction in the level of RBP protein in liver after treatment of adult rats with a synthetic retinoid, N-(4-hydroxyphenyl) retinamide (HPR) [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], or RA [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Collectively, these results may support the idea that the liver interprets the increase in available retinoids after VARA supplementation as a signal of the body&#x02019;s VA adequacy and senses this increase as extrahepatic tissues having sufficient VA [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Consequently, the liver may reduce the production and flow of RBP. To maintain normal VA homeostasis, <italic>Lrat</italic> and <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> may be up-regulated to store the excess VA for later use and to remove excess RA, respectively. This collaborative regulation of <italic>Lrat</italic> and <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> via VA availability has been suggested based on observation in several other studies in adult rat tissues [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Our work confirms these same observations during neonatal development.</p><p>Fourth, the lung is also a VA storage organ, as well as a tissue that depends on adequate retinol and RA for proper alveolar septation in the neonatal period [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In our study, the expression in the lung of genes involved in VA uptake (<italic>Stra6</italic>) and the removal of excess RA (<italic>Cyp26B1</italic>) remained constant during the postnatal period; however, their expression was strongly up-regulated 6 h after VARA supplementation. On the other hand, <italic>Lrat</italic> expression in the lung appeared to be dependent on age and on VA availability. Previously, neonatal VARA supplementation was shown to increase the expression of <italic>Stra6</italic>, <italic>Lrat</italic>, and <italic>Cyp26B1</italic> in P7 rat lung [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. The regulatory effect of VARA supplementation on these genes was transient, as mRNA levels were significantly up-regulated 6 h after dose administration but had returned to near baseline levels 12 hours after VARA supplementation. Our current study that examined the response to VARA across the neonatal period indicates that VARA supplementation induces the expression of all three genes as early as P1. Interestingly, <italic>Stra6</italic> displayed highest expression after oral VARA supplementation of newborn rats (P1), with a decrease in magnitude with age. It should also be noted that by P10, neonates had received VARA supplementation on 4 occasions (<xref rid="pone.0145924.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), so the attenuation of the expression of <italic>Stra6</italic> to VARA supplementation with age could be the result of sufficient retinoid accumulation, resulting in a feedback effect on retinol uptake. For <italic>Cyp26B1</italic> in the lung, expression was increased after VARA supplementation at all ages, similar to that for <italic>Stra6</italic>, with a decrease in the magnitude of <italic>Cyp26B1</italic> response with age, especially in adults. This contrasts to the response of <italic>Cyp26A1</italic> in liver, in which the greatest increase was observed in adult VARA-supplemented rats. Our results suggest that excess retinol availability due to accumulative VARA supplementation results in decreased uptake of VA in lung through <italic>Stra6</italic> and less RA production through down-regulated expression of <italic>Raldh</italic>. Despite the significant increase in <italic>Lrat</italic> expression after VARA supplementation, neonates at P4 (the beginning of alveolar septation in the rat) and P10 (middle of the septation period) [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] had the smallest increase in <italic>Lrat</italic> expression compared to P1 and adult rats. This may imply that esterification and storage of retinol in response to the VARA dose was reduced in the middle neonatal period, which could be concomitant with an increased utilization of VA for proper lung septation and alveolarization.</p><p>Fifth, the expression of <italic>Raldh</italic> genes is often considered a surrogate indicator of RA production, as RA itself has a very short half-life and its production per se would be extremely difficult to measure in vivo. In our study, we represented RA production by examining <italic>Raldh-1</italic>, <italic>-2</italic>, and <italic>-3</italic> expression in the lungs of neonatal and adult rats. RALDHs have been shown to be expressed in rodent organs, including the lung, throughout embryogenesis [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In our study, the expression in these three genes in the lung differed during ontogeny, as well as in response to VARA supplementation. <italic>Raldh-1</italic> and -<italic>3</italic> expression levels increased from neonatal to adult age (<xref rid="pone.0145924.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145924.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>). Previous research confirmed this age-dependent trend in mucosal dendritic cells [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Interestingly, VARA supplementation, which acutely provides both VA and RA to the animals (see elevation in plasma retinol, <xref rid="pone.0145924.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), suppressed <italic>Raldh-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic> expression, but only in adults. Because RA acts as a ligand for nuclear transcription factors and its concentration is tightly regulated [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>], this suppression may prevent the accumulation of an excess of endogenously formed RA. It may also be that <italic>Raldh-1</italic> and -<italic>2</italic> in the lung of neonates, compared to adults, were less regulated by VARA supplementation because the expression of <italic>Cyp26B1</italic> after VARA supplementation was greater in neonates than in adults (<xref rid="pone.0145924.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref> and <xref rid="pone.0145924.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Sixth, the kidney is known to play an important role in retinoid homeostasis, contributing to about 50% of the total circulating pool of the RBP-ROH complex in rats [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Christensen et al. [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] have demonstrated the importance of megalin <italic>(Lrp2)</italic> for maintaining VA homeostasis. Approximately 5% of the circulating RBP-ROH complex is not bound to the co-transporter protein transthyretin, TTR, and is thus more readily filtered in the kidney and lost through urinary excretion. Interestingly, megalin is an LDL endocytic receptor protein for a variety of substances and vitamins, including VA and others, and is important for proximal tubular retinol reabsorption. Other researchers have shown that megalin is expressed during embryogenesis as early as day 4 of gestation and in adult kidneys, but have not examined the postnatal period. RA has also been shown to up-regulate the expression of megalin [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0145924.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Our results (<xref rid="pone.0145924.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5</xref>) show that VARA supplementation did not alter the expression of megalin during ontogeny in the neonatal kidney, but significantly increased megalin expression in adult kidney. This may suggest that an excess of VA or RA, in the adult, triggers an increase in megalin expression that in turn contributes to enhanced uptake of retinol from plasma. Although megalin is generally considered part of a process of conservation, megalin might also contribute to removal of excess retinol under conditions of VA surplus. Our results for <italic>Lrat</italic> expression in the kidney suggest that early life exposure to VARA may significantly upregulate the capacity for VA storage, but that responsiveness to VARA is lost as the neonate matures. These results not only add to information on the tissue specific regulation of <italic>Lrat</italic> gene expression, but also are interesting in being similar to the response pattern of the lung, but contrasting for both tissues with the response of the liver, in which <italic>Lrat</italic> expression was least responsive to VARA at the earliest ages examined. These results suggest that, early after birth, the kidney could play a more important role in VA storage. Interestingly, for some species (as studied at adult age) the kidney is a major organ of VA storage [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>In addition to investigating the direct effect of VARA supplementation on retinol concentration and the ontogenic expression of retinoid homeostatic genes in VA storage tissues, we asked if there is a carryover effect of neonatal VARA supplementation in adult rats. The &#x0201c;VARA adult carry over&#x0201d; rats had been supplemented with VARA as neonates (up to P10) but they were not treated with VARA prior to euthanasia as adults. Our results demonstrated a carry over effect on tissue retinol concentration only in liver. Recent studies support our findings of longer maintenance of retinol levels in liver in comparison to extrahepatic tissues such as the lung [<xref rid="pone.0145924.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. It is interesting to note that the VARA adult carryover rats displayed a significant decrease (denoted as &#x0201c;negative&#x0201d;) in liver <italic>Rbp4</italic>, liver and lung <italic>Lrat</italic>, and lung <italic>Cyp26B1</italic> (<xref rid="pone.0145924.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>), in comparison to both control (oil-treated) rats and adult rats that received VARA 6 h prior to euthanasia. While VARA can be said to push excess VA towards esterification and oxidation to maintain homeostasis, it may be that by adulthood gene expression for this purpose is no longer needed. In addition, the lack of a carryover effect of neonatal VARA supplementation on adult-age megalin expression suggests that this would likely be a short-term regulatory mechanism. At present, we do not have an explanation for these results, however further studies are needed to characterize these changes as they have implications for the use of retinoid therapy in neonates.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec016"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In summary, our results show a postnatal developmental pattern of total retinol concentration and expression of genes that regulate retinoid homeostasis in plasma and VA storage organs such as the lung, liver, and kidney in rats. In addition, we have shown that oral supplementation of VA in conjunction with 10% RA can alter total retinol availability and gene expression. Although we are uncertain whether the regulation of these genes in neonates is beneficial, we have gained insight on how neonatal VA supplementation regulates recycling (megalin, <italic>Lrp2</italic>), trafficking (<italic>Rbp4</italic>), storage (<italic>Lrat</italic>), and oxidation of retinoids (<italic>Raldh</italic>s and <italic>Cyp26</italic>s). It has been of great interest to determine whether neonatal treatment with VA or RA has any long-term benefit, or at least no adverse effect, in those that have received supplementation at birth; therefore, we have sought to understand the possible long-term effects of neonatal oral supplementation with VARA. The results from this study may help inform the clinical treatment of VA deficiency diseases and the development of nutritional recommendations for neonates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Dr. Reza Zolfaghari and Dr. Nan-Qian Li for their helpful advice and assistance.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0145924.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><collab>World Health Organization</collab>. <source>Guideline for vitamin A supplementation in infants 1&#x02013;5 months of age</source>. <publisher-loc>Geneva, Switzerland</publisher-loc>: <publisher-name>World Health Organization</publisher-name>,; <year>2011</year> Available from: WHO <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/guidelines/vas_infants_1-5/en/NCBI">http://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/micronutrients/guidelines/vas_infants_1-5/en/NCBI</ext-link>
