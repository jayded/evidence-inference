About 10,000 infants with Thalassemia major are born every year. The present study was under taken with a hope to prevail better quality of life to the Thalassemic patients. Pallor being the chief complaint, a randomized controlled trial was undertaken with <italic>Dhatri Avaleha</italic> as it is specially mentioned for <italic>Pandu, Kamala</italic> &#x00026; <italic>Haleemaka Roga</italic>. Children between age group of 1 to 15 years were randomly divided in two groups: Drug treated group (Group A) and Control group (Group B). Assessment was done on subjective and objective parameters after 30 and 60 days of treatment with follow up of two month. Statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01) result was obtained in Blood transfusion interval in group &#x02018;A&#x02019; in comparison to group &#x02018;B&#x02019;. <italic>Dhatri Avaleha</italic> may have a potential to increase blood transfusion interval and decrease secondary infection and thus it can be used as supportive therapy with modern medical management.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Thalassemia</kwd><kwd>Pandu</kwd><kwd><italic>Kamala</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Haleemaka</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Dhatri Avaleha</italic></kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Today is the era of advancement, which can be seen in each field either it might be media, electronic, science or in the day-to-day life i.e. dietetic habits, daily routines as well, hence the ultimate effect of all these changes go towards the problems in coming generation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>. These changes occur in the field of medical science too, among them Thalassemia is a new disease for <italic>Ayurveda</italic> and thus called as &#x0201c;<italic>Anukta Vyadhi</italic>&#x0201d;.</p><p>Thalassemia is an inherited blood disorder in which body is unable to make adequate hemoglobin, which is present in the red cells. Normally red cells survive for 120 days but in Thalassemia red cell survival is reduced. In India the combined carrier rate of b Thalassemia, HbE &#x00026; Sickle Cell Anemia is 3.9%. i.e. 3 crore Indians are Thalassemic carriers and 8000 to 10,000 Thalassemia major are born every year in India. The prevalence for b Thalassemia carrier state varies 0-17% in different ethnic groups. It is very high among certain communities like Punjabis, Sindhis, Gujaratis (Lohana and Bhanushali), Bengalis, Parsis. Thus the morbidity and mortality of this disease has aroused a lot's of research for its alleviation and cure. So keeping all these views in mind great hopes are being laid on <italic>Ayurveda</italic> as cost effective adjuvant therapy in Thalassemia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref> to prevent its complication and hazardous effects.</p><p>The present study is an attempt to analyze the efficacy of <italic>Dhatri Avaleha</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref> in management of Thalassemia in comparison to a control group managed by routine modern therapy. The drug had been chosen keeping in view its <italic>Rasayana, Antioxidant</italic> and <italic>Hepatoprotective</italic> properties.</p><p>The main aim of study was to provide a better quality of life and to reduce complication and delay the blood transfusion interval by <italic>Ayurvedic</italic> medicines.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Material and Methods</title><p><italic>Selection of patients:</italic> Patients attending the I.P.D. of Thalassemia ward of M.

In the Group &#x02018;A&#x02019; 8 patients completed the course of treatment with follow up and in Group &#x02018;B&#x02019;6 patients were continued under observation. Among 19 patients 09 (47.37%) belonged to an age group of 1 to 5 years. It may be due to that most of the Thalassemic patients (Thalassemia major) are diagnosed within the age group of 1 year<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>. Male and female ratio was found almost equal. Maximum number i.e. 14(73.68%) were Hindu, it might be due to dominancy of Hindu in Jamnagar district. The incidence of Thalassemia was maximum i.e. 03 (15.79%) present in Lohana and Kumahar community in comparison to others. Because it is more common in these Gujarati community (Lohana, bhanushali and katchi et.)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>. Majority of the patients i.e. 12 (63.61%) were diagnosed within the age of 1 yr<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>. It may be due to clinical manifestation of Thalassemia major starts within the age of first year of life. Before starting the trial drug no. of blood transfusion was found &#x0003e; 100 times in 04 (21.05%) patients. It might be due to rapid breakdown of RBCs leading to severe anemia which can only be compensated by blood transfusion. It was observed that maximum i.e. 16 (84.21%) patients were having Thalassemia major because of &#x000df; Thalassemia major prevalent in Gujarat and as well in India. Most of the patients i.e. 13 (68.42%) found not taking any iron chelators. The reason behind not taking iron chelators because of these drugs are very costly and most of the patients were belonging to lower socio-economic group. During surgical history majority i.e. 17 (89.47%) patients having splenectomy not done; it might be due to most of the patient registered from G. G. Singh, hospital were under regular blood transfusion. Only 06 (31.58%) patients were having consanguieous marriage history in parents. It may be due to that most of the patients were from Hindu religion.</p><p>Most of the patients i.e.08 (42.11%) were having hepato - spleenomegaly, which may be due to regular blood transfusion. Only 07 patients, parents were investigated for NESTROFT.
