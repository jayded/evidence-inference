Background</title><p>Falling-related trauma in elderly patients is the most common reason for injury and mortality (<xref rid="A23573R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Falling is considered as the main concern in Parkinson&#x02019;s Disease (PD). Reportedly near two-thirds of PD patients (PP) have a yearly history of falling with half of them with a repeated history of falling (<xref rid="A23573R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Injury and falling-related fears as the outcomes of PD (<xref rid="A23573R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>-<xref rid="A23573R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>) are common in sedentary lifestyles (<xref rid="A23573R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) aggravating the tension in caring of such patients (<xref rid="A23573R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>). An estimated number of 5 million patients have PD in only ten populated countries, which may be doubled for next three decades (<xref rid="A23573R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). In spite of providing modern caring system in the recent years, anti-PD drugs had no effect on falling (<xref rid="A23573R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Hence, falling due to PD imposes a heavy cost of caring and rehabilitation in the following years.</p><p>Considering scarcity of literature, the effects of exercise on falling in PP were evaluated (<xref rid="A23573R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). Ashburn et al. (2007) on their short-term exercise protocol reported an improvement in falling (<xref rid="A23573R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>).</p><p>In general, significant effects of exercise are assessed in chronic exercise protocols (tens of hours to months) (<xref rid="A23573R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>).</p><p>The established risk factors for falling in PD are lower extremity muscular weakness, poor balance and gait freezing (<xref rid="A23573R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>), all of which improve in PD following some exercise (<xref rid="A23573R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>-<xref rid="A23573R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>). According to Latt (<xref rid="A23573R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) a series of factors are considered as risk factors for falling in PP (e.g., bradykinesia, poor balance, freezing of gait, cognitive impairment as well as age-related impairments, such as reduced lower limb muscle strength). For this reason, designing a corrective exercise to reduce falling to some extent would be targeted to partially recover the balance and lower limb muscle strength. Accordingly, an exercise program for improving falling in PD may be of benefit.</p></sec><sec id="sec133506"><title>2. Objectives</title><p>Given beneficial effects of exercise in alleviating locomotor problems of PD and that performing corrective exercise may be effective we sought to assess the effects of exercise to see whether performing a selective 10-week corrective exercise with an emphasis on gait training activities (GTA) lessens the number of falls (NOFs) and fear of falling using the Fall Efficacy Scale-international (FES-I), functional balance in Berg balance scale (BBS), and the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test among PP.</p></sec><sec id="sec133513"><title>3. Patients and Methods</title><sec id="sec133507"><title>3.1. Study Design</title><p>The sampling was made based on a purposeful method. Participants were voluntarily recruited from university affiliated neurology clinics and private neurology offices in Kashan. This study consisted of a 10-week (3 sessions per week, each lasting 60 min) corrective exercise for PP who had fallen or were at risk of falling conducted in 2014. After baseline assessment, participants were randomly allocated to control and two exercise groups. The sample size for participants in each group was based on similar studies (<xref rid="A23573R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>).</p><p> The exercise groups were exercise group with balance pad (Exercise Group with Balance Pad [EGBP (no: 15)]) or without a balance pad (Exercise Group with no Balance Pad [EGNBP (no: 15)]). One participant of the EGNBP group dropped out of the study.</p><p>The control group (no: 17) received their usual care by a neurologist. Two participants in the control group dropped out of the study.</p><p>Cognitive function assessment with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) was conducted one hour after participant's last dose of anti-PD drug.</p></sec><sec id="sec133508"><title>3.2. Participants</title><p>At the start of study, all participants were sequentially screened by a neurologist. Medical assessment was performed to assess whether he or she is able to participate in moderate-intensity wholly-supervised exercise (an MMSE score of &#x0003e; 24) before enrollment in the study. A total of 47 (33 M, 14 F) participants in the second and third stages of the disease were selected based on Hoehn and Yahr criteria (<xref rid="A23573R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>).</p><p>Participants were included in the study if had a diagnosis of idiopathic PD for three years and were able to walk independently, aged between 50 and 70 years, consumed the same anti-PD medication for past 2 weeks and had a history of falling in the past year.

The NOFs were recorded by direct questioning. ii) FES-I: a fall efficacy questionnaire denoting the fear of falling (<xref rid="A23573R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). iii) The BBS used for assessing functional balance of participants (<xref rid="A23573R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>), consisted of 14 items assessing the capability to keep balance in different positions/postures. Scoring was based on participant&#x02019;s ability to do the tasks on a four-score system from 0 (inability in performing) to 4 (normal performance). The higher the acquired scores, the better the participant's balance. BBS was used for routine clinical and research applications as a balance measure, especially in PD (<xref rid="A23573R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). iv) The TUG test used for assessment of balance and falling was defined as the time taken for performing a complex task (e.g. a sequential action: standing up from a chair with no arms and 45 cm height from the ground, walking 3 m, turning 180&#x000b0;, returning and sitting down (<xref rid="A23573R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>).

The warm-up consisted of lower extremity stretch muscle groups, which act to prevent collapse of the lower limb (hip and knee extensors and ankle plantar flexors) targeted with exercises designed to enhance posture control (i.e. balance) with an emphasis on GTA. The balance exercises were included standing with a decreased base of support, forwards, backwards and sideway leg raise, and graded reaching activities in standing sit-to-stand, forward or lateral step-ups, semi squats and heel raises in standing as well. GTA included forwards, backwards and sideways stepping/walking, static and dynamic marching and tandem walking. Standard principles governing frequency, volume, duration, intensity and progression of exercises were applied (<xref rid="A23573R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). The exercise sessions were terminated with 5 minutes cool-down exercise. In both exercise groups, the same training protocol was performed. While, in EGBP all exercises were performed for 4 weeks and then for another 6 weeks using different balance pad sizes (6, 10 cm thickness, AIREX mat, Switzerland [(L) 93 cm &#x000d7; (B) 41 cm &#x000d7; (H) 10 cm); (L) 98 cm &#x000d7; (B) 41 cm &#x000d7; (H) 6 cm], respectively.

Discussion</title><p>Our study on idiopathic PP revealed that administrating a selective corrective exercise on a balance pad in EGBP group showed a significant difference in NOF, while without a balance pad in EGNBP group showed no significant difference. In addition, administrating the same exercise on both EGBP and EGNBP groups showed a significant improvement in FES-I, BBS and TUG.</p><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and PD are primary and secondary causes of neurodegeneration worldwide (<xref rid="A23573R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>). Fall-related injuries are the cause of disability (70 - 87%) (<xref rid="A23573R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>)and higher rates of fractures in PD surviving for decades after PD onset (<xref rid="A23573R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>).</p><p>The core medical management of PD is drug therapy to enhance decreased dopamine secretion. Anti-PD drugs are routinely used in the first stages of PD; their use in advance stages of the disease has no beneficial effect (<xref rid="A23573R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>). Nevertheless, even with administration of best selective drugs, PP has repeated falls with destructive outcomes. Reportedly more than 68% of PP have a history of falling and up to 46% of people with PD disease would experience frequent falls annually (<xref rid="A23573R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>), which is two times more than normal individuals (<xref rid="A23573R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Consistent with this finding, a one-year length study reported a yearly 27% falling rate among PP.</p><p>In addition, as reported by most PD researchers, falling etiology is multifactorial. Independent factors involved in higher falling risk are chronic nature of PD, having a sedentary lifestyle, multiple locomotor disorders, abnormal posture, freezing of gait, frontal impairment, impaired balance and reduced knee extensor strength (<xref rid="A23573R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). Furthermore, osteoporosis and osteopenia are very common findings in patients with PD. Multiple mechanisms are involved in the occurrence of osteoporosis in PP including sedentary life, endocrine (i.e., lower vitamin D level), malnutrition and iatrogenic reasons, female sex, stages III and IV of Hoehn and Yahr criteria (<xref rid="A23573R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>), aging and lower BMI (<xref rid="A23573R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>). As PD usually occurs late in life, postural instability and unsteady gait disorders usually contribute to fall-related fractures.</p><p>Considering significance of fall-related injuries and fractures among this group, there is an urgent need to identify and use effective exercise interventions to reduce falls and related injuries in patients with PD. To date, only few clinical studies investigated corrective exercise interventions to reduce falls in patients with PD. In our study, we showed that administrating a selective corrective exercise in EGBP resulted in a significant difference in NOF between pre-test and post-test, while administrating the same exercise in EGNBP led to no significant difference between pre-test and post-test and only caused a 33.3% decrease in falling rate.</p><p>Reviewing the literature in senile group demonstrated the benefits and preventive role of exercise interventions on balance and lower extremity muscle strength in falling (<xref rid="A23573R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>). Moreover, a significant correlation between lower extremity muscle strength in PD and physical parameters has been reported (<xref rid="A23573R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>), which emphasizes the effect of exercise as an appropriate intervention in this group.</p><p>Reportedly posture instability is the main characteristic of late PD (<xref rid="A23573R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>), which causes falling (<xref rid="A23573R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>). It is well established that impaired balance is the probable psychological outcome of FOF. FOF is considered as immediate outcome preceding falls, which can result in severe immobility (<xref rid="A23573R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>).</p><p>A series of studies (<xref rid="A23573R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="A23573R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>-<xref rid="A23573R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) using some specific tools such as Berg Balance Scale, Functional reach test and Sensory Orientation Test (SOT) indicated balance as an outcome of PD and reported a significant improvement in balance. Nevertheless, Toole et al. (<xref rid="A23573R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>) noticed an encouraging improvement on SOT, but not on the Berg Balance Scale. Cakit et al. (<xref rid="A23573R47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>) and Hackney et al. (<xref rid="A23573R48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>) showed an improvement in BBS in incremental speed-dependent treadmill training and progressive Tango lessons, respectively.</p><p>Caglar et al. using a home-based exercise (<xref rid="A23573R49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>) and Tamir et al. using a physiotherapy technique plus imagery (<xref rid="A23573R50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>) found the same findings and reported the efficient role of corrective exercise on TUG.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank academic members of Kish International Campus of Tehran University and the authorities of Shahid Beheshti Hospital of Kashan for their kind cooperation during the project.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="afn44484" fn-type="other"><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; Contribution:</bold>Hassan Daneshmandi, supervised the project.
