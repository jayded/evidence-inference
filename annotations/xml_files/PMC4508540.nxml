Meanwhile it usually requires constant supervision by physiotherapists and is therefore more expensive than customary care. This study compared the preliminary efficacy of two modified CIMT protocols. A two-group randomized controlled trial with pre and post treatment measures and six months follow-up was conducted. Nineteen patients with chronic stroke received 10 treatment sessions distributed three to four times a week over 22 days. CIMT3h_direct group received 3 hours of CIMT supervised by a therapist (n=10) while CIMT1.5h_direct group had 1.5 hours of supervised CIMT+1.5 hours home exercises supervised by a caregiver (n=9). Outcome measures were the Fugl-Meyer Assessment, the Motor Activity Log, and the Stroke Specific Quality of Life Scale. The modified CIMT protocols were feasible and well tolerated. Improvements in motor function, real-world arm use and quality of life did not differ significantly between treated groups receiving either 3 or 1.5 hours mCIMT supervised by a therapist.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>modified constraint-induced therapy</kwd><kwd>motor impairment and function</kwd><kwd>quality of life</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="1"/><equation-count count="1"/><ref-count count="57"/><page-count count="6"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Global ageing is associated with an ever-increasing number of elderly individuals at increased risk for stroke.<sup><xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Stroke is a condition with high incidence and mortality, and the most common cause of disability worldwide.<sup><xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Most strokes occur in developing countries,<sup><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> presenting a major burden to health care.</p><p>In stroke patients, recovery of the upper limb is often limited when compared with that of the lower limb.<sup><xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Loss of upper limb function significantly contributes to overall disability.<sup><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) is an evidence-based therapy for upper limb rehabilitation that evolved from basic research.<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The original protocol involved training of the upper limb by shaping and task practice for 6 hours per day and constraint of the unaffected hand for approximately 90% of waking hours during two weeks.<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> The effectiveness of CIMT in post-stroke patients has been shown by randomized clinical trials.<sup><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11-13</xref></sup> CIMT improves real-world arm function significantly more than customary care, or no treatment, in the chronic phase after stroke.</p><p>A limitation to widespread use of CIMT in stroke rehabilitation is that the original CIMT protocol requires constant supervision by physiotherapists during several hours per day, and is therefore more expensive than customary care.<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> CIMT protocol is very difficult to implement under conditions of developing countries where most strokes occur.

Randomization information was stored in sealed envelopes that were kept in a cabinet accessible solely to the principal investigator. Each patient received 10 treatment sessions distributed three to four times a week over 22 days. In the CIMT<sub>1.5h_direct</sub> group, patients performed exercises with the paretic upper limb for 1.5 hours at an outpatient facility and home exercises, supervised by a caregiver or family member, for additional 1.5 hours. Two days before treatment started, the caregiver was trained for one hour by the researcher providing CIMT on how to supervise the prescribed exercises performed by the patient at home. Each caregiver was instructed to make notes in a log book about the exercises performed, the number of repetitions and difficulties experience by the patient. At the beginning of each session the homework was discussed and when necessary, the level of difficulty was increased or new tasks were prescribed.</p><p>Patients in the CIMT<sub>3h</sub>_<sub>direct</sub> group performed exercises under direct supervision of the same therapist that treated patients in the CIMT<sub>1.5h</sub>_<sub>direct</sub> group for 3 hours per session, at the outpatient facility.</p><p>In both groups, training was provided in an individual basis and consisted of shaping principles, as outlined by Taub <italic>et al.</italic>,<sup><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> and task specific practice. Shaping exercises comprised a battery of tasks including grasping and releasing objects of different shapes, playing cards and board games, clay activities, drawing and painting. Tasks were tailored to needs of each patient. Task-specific practice for both groups involved preparing a snack (sandwiches and juice), including arranging dishes and cutlery on a table, washing and drying them, and putting them in a cupboard. Treatment regimens were designed to ensure that both groups received the same amount of task practice and shaping.</p><p>In both groups, patients were required to use a padded mitt in the unaffected hand at home, as much as possible during waking hours. The mitt prevented use of the unaffected hand to perform fine motor activities and should be used during activities of daily living (ADL) and household activities. The CIMT<sub>1.5h_direct</sub> group received written assignment of practice at home. All patients were instructed to record the use time of the mitt and any difficulties perceived at home, in log books. At the beginning of each outpatient session the notes were discussed and, if necessary, problem-solving strategies were applied.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-5"><title>Outcome measures <italic>Primary outcome</italic></title><p>The primary outcome measure was the Motor Activity Log (MAL).<sup><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> The MAL was developed to measure the use of the affected arm in real world,<sup><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> and consists of a semi-structured interview that can be applied to both patients and caregivers.

Results immediately after treatment and six months after that suggest that both protocols are equally efficient. Both groups had the same total training time (30 hours). However, CIMT<sub>1.5h_direct</sub> group may be considered less expensive due to less demand on therapist&#x02019;s time.</p><p>All previous studies that addressed the effectiveness of unsupervised practice at home also suggested similar effectiveness of different versions of modified CIMT. Supervision for only 25 to 50% of the time was as effective as standard one-to-one CIMT.<sup><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> Likewise, similar gains in motor skill and real-world arm use were reported after and one hour of supervised outpatient practice coupled with 5 hours of unsupervised practice during two weeks at home.<sup><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Furthermore, An exclusive home-based mCIMT program supervised by an instructed family member was equally effective as a totally supervised protocol and persisted for the next six months.<sup><xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup></p><p>The development of flexible schedules may increase the number of treated patients. When questioned about their interest in participating in an original CIMT protocol,<sup><xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> 68% of inquired patients said they were not interested because of concerns about the number of hours spent daily in therapy and the length of time required for wearing the restrictive device.</p><p>In mCIMT studies, participants are typically requested to wear the constraint from five to six hours daily,<sup><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup> to 90% of the waking hours.<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41-43</xref></sup> Nevertheless, few studies reveal the real average number of daily hours with restraint in their results.<sup><xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="ref44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup></p><p>In the present study, besides the declared mitt time use, some patients informed they consciously avoided the use of the less affected arm in ADLs during the treatment period, so the actual restraint time is somewhat difficult to measure precisely. The contribution of the restraint component of CIMT is in fact not fully established.<sup><xref rid="ref45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> A mCIMT study with random assignment comparing protocols with and without restraint in 24 patients found similar motor improvements after a one-year follow-up.<sup><xref rid="ref46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref></sup> A recent study,<sup><xref rid="ref47" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></sup> evolving 47 participants, showed no difference between two groups of post stroke patients treated with a combination of CIMT and physiotherapy plus different constraint regimens (sling <italic>versus</italic> voluntary constraint). It seems that using a sling were not an advantage over voluntary constraint.</p><p>As to functional outcomes, the present study indicates a substantial improvement in real world arm use after intervention in both groups. In a partially supervised CIMT program based on Taub&#x02019;s protocol,<sup><xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> gains in MAL were lost six months after therapy. Training in the present study was less intensive (three hours a day) and distributed over a longer period of time (21 days). This may have contributed to retention of therapeutic gains in both groups of patients. MAL scores at the six-month follow-up exhibited significant improvements in both groups with total score &#x0003e;2.5, indicating a perception of recovery above 50%.<sup><xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> The MAL results in our study were consistent with those observed in another protocol with the same intensity and duration.<sup><xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup></p><p>There is evidence that many post stroke patients do not use their paretic hand spontaneously due to <italic>learned non-use</italic>.<sup><xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> The detected benefits in the FMA were partially but still meaningfully sustained after six months, although in CIMT<sub>1.5h_direct</sub> results did not reached statistical significance. FMA is a laboratory test that assesses motor function, showing what patients can do when requested.</p><p>Although CIMT protocols results in improved function it is not clear whether CIMT is necessary to reach the results reported in several studies or whether exposure to task-specific and high-intensity training are the main components for recovery.<sup><xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> Recently Taub <italic>et al.</italic><sup><xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> discussed the relevance of the <italic>transfer package</italic> that is a set of techniques to help transfer of therapeutic gains from laboratory to real life. The study concluded that the transfer package seems to be an important element of CIMT protocols increasing real-world treatment outcomes. The present study applied some principles of the transfer package like written assignment of practice at home, daily home diary and problem solving strategies to increase arm use in ADL. Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is a multidimensional concept and can be impacted by several factors besides physical or mental status.<sup><xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref></sup> A Chinese study with chronic stroke patients found that <italic>having a lower income</italic> was the strongest predicting variable for low HRQOL scores.<sup><xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref></sup> The effect of exercises on HRQOL in stroke survivors is not fully studied. A recent meta-analysis showed small to medium effects of exercises in HRQOL outcomes after intervention but not 12 to 24 weeks at follow-up.<sup><xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref></sup> In the present study, the absence of significant differences in EI for the SSQOL may be related to the small sample size, because within-group analysis showed significant improvements only in the CIMT<sub>3h</sub>
<sub>group</sub>.</p><p>The limitations of the present study are related to its small sample size and to the absence of a control group not receiving CIMT. Strict study criteria akin to those of EXCITE led to the inclusion of only 13.8% of screened subjects. Hence, our results should necessarily be considered preliminary. Future trials should involve a larger number of participants. This should allow investigating the ideal amount of daily training and the influence of each CIMT element in functional recovery. In conclusion, our modified CIMT protocols were feasible and well tolerated. Results in bothCIMT1.5h_<sub>direct</sub> group and CIMT<sub>3h_direct</sub> group were associated with similar improvements in real world arm use after stroke. As protocols involving less therapist supervision can reduce treatment costs, these results, if confirmed, could lead to a wider dissemination of CIMT as a standard treatment in large numbers of stroke survivors.
