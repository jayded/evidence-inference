However, patients express concerns that go beyond just these physical symptoms. They report anxieties stemming from a lack of control over their bodily functions, fear of disease progression or hospitalisation, of colectomy, and of not having immediate access to a toilet.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;5</xref></sup> Physical symptoms and associated anxiety affect patients<bold>&#x02019;</bold> employment opportunities and work productivity,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> limit their ability to engage in social and recreational activities,<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;5</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> and may impair their ability to develop and maintain strong relationships with others, leading to difficulties in achieving intimacy, and feelings of isolation and depression.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> These experiences are concordant with findings that the presence and severity of physical symptoms have a significant impact on patients<bold>&#x02019;</bold> health-related quality of life [HRQoL], including their functioning and well-being.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Accordingly, treatments that demonstrate efficacy in improving clinical measures of disease can bring about improvements in HRQoL.<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11&#x02013;13</xref></sup></p><p>Patient-reported outcomes [PROs] have been recommended for inclusion in clinical trials assessing UC,<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;17</xref></sup> as they directly reflect patient-perceived benefits of treatment.<sup><xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> Findings, indicating that clinicians often underestimate the impact of UC symptoms on patients<bold>&#x02019;</bold> functioning and well-being, support the importance of characterising and quantifying patients<bold>&#x02019;</bold> perspectives to fully understand the effectiveness of UC treatments.<sup><xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In addition, patients, providers, payers, and regulators seek information on how patients feel and function in daily life, using well-defined, validated, and reliable assessments.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref></sup></p><p>Tofacitinib is an oral, small molecule Janus kinase inhibitor that is being investigated for UC.

Patients</title><p>OCTAVE Induction 1 [NCT01465763] and OCTAVE Induction 2 [NCT01458951] were identically designed, 8-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. OCTAVE Induction 1 enrolled patients at 144 sites globally between April 2012 and May 2015. OCTAVE Induction 2 enrolled patients at 169 sites globally between June 2012 and April 2015.</p><p>Patients had to be aged &#x02265; 18 years and have a confirmed diagnosis of moderately to severely active UC for &#x02265; 4 months, defined by a Mayo score of 6&#x02013;12, with a rectal bleeding subscore of 1&#x02013;3 and an endoscopic subscore of 2&#x02013;3. Eligibility was based on centrally read Mayo endoscopic subscores. Patients had to have previous failed treatment or to have demonstrated intolerance to treatment with at least one of the following therapies: corticosteroids, azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, infliximab, or adalimumab. Concomitant oral 5-aminosalicylates and oral corticosteroids [25 mg/day prednisone equivalent] were permitted in OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2, provided they were stably dosed throughout the study periods. Concomitant therapy with any anti-tumour necrosis factor [TNF] therapy [8-week washout period], azathioprine [2-week washout], methotrexate [2-week washout], and 6-mercaptopurine [2-week washout] was prohibited.</p><p>Patients who completed OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 with clinical response [&#x02265; 3-point and &#x02265; 30% decrease from baseline Mayo score, plus decrease in rectal bleeding subscore of &#x02265; 1 point or absolute rectal bleeding subscore of 0 or 1] were eligible to participate in a 52-week tofacitinib maintenance study, OCTAVE Sustain [NCT01458574], which enrolled patients at 297 sites globally between July 2012 and May 2016. Steroid tapering was mandatory in OCTAVE Sustain, starting in the first week of the study. The tapering regime required all patients to be steroid free by Week 7.</p></sec><sec id="s9"><title>2.2. Study design</title><p>The study designs of OCTAVE Induction 1, OCTAVE Induction 2, and OCTAVE Sustain have been reported previously.<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> Patients in OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 were randomised [1:4] to treatment with placebo or tofacitinib 10 mg twice daily [BID] for 8 weeks. OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 also included a tofacitinib 15 mg BID treatment arm, which was discontinued following a protocol amendment. Data from patients who received tofacitinib 15 mg BID in OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 were analysed separately and are not reported in this manuscript. In OCTAVE Sustain, patients were re-randomised [1:1:1] to receive placebo, tofacitinib 5 mg BID, or tofacitinib 10 mg BID for 52 weeks.

PRO instruments</title><p>HRQoL was assessed using the disease-specific IBDQ 32-item questionnaire and generic SF-36v2 [acute form, 1-week recall]. The IBDQ provides a total score [range from 32 to 224; higher scores indicate better HRQoL] and four domain scores: bowel symptoms [10 items, scored from 10 to 70]; systemic symptoms [5 items, scored from 5 to 35]; emotional function [12 items, scored from 12 to 84]; and social function [5 items, scored from 5 to 35].<sup><xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> Higher domain and total scores indicate better HRQoL. An increase in the IBDQ total score of &#x02265; 16 points from baseline corresponds to clinically meaningful IBDQ response, and an absolute IBDQ total score of &#x02265; 170 corresponds to IBDQ remission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> The IBDQ was self-administered by patients at baseline, Week 4 and Week 8 in induction studies, and at Weeks 8 [ie 8 weeks post-baseline], 16, 24, 32, 40 and 52 in the maintenance study. IBDQ data at Week 8 of the induction studies were used as baseline values for the maintenance study.</p><p>The SF-36v2<sup><xref rid="CIT0029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> assesses eight domains of functional health [physical functioning, role physical, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional, and mental health], scored from 0 to 100 and then standardised into norm-based <italic>T</italic>-scores with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 for the US general population. Scores from all domains are summarised as physical and mental component summary [PCS and MCS] scores, which are also expressed as <italic>T</italic>-scores. Higher domain and summary scores indicate better HRQoL. The SF-36v2 was self-administered by patients at baseline and Week 8 in induction studies, and at Weeks 24 and 52 in the maintenance study.

Patients with missing data were treated as non-responders. Continuous endpoints based on IBDQ scores were analysed using linear mixed-effects [LME] models based on all available [observed case] data.

In OCTAVE Sustain, baseline of maintenance study, treatment group, remission status at baseline of OCTAVE Sustain, treatment assignment in induction study, visit, and treatment group by visit interaction were treated as fixed effects, and subject as a random effect in LME models. Continuous endpoints based on SF-36v2 were analysed using analysis of covariance models in induction studies [with treatment group, previous treatment with anti-TNF therapy, steroid use at baseline, and geographical region as factors, and baseline as a covariate] and LME models in maintenance studies [with fixed and random effects as above for continuous endpoints based on IBDQ], both based on observed case data.<sup><xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> Least squares [LS] mean changes from baseline IBDQ total scores, IBDQ domain scores, SF-36v2 domain scores, and SF-36v2 PCS and MCS scores were calculated using these models.

Discussion</title><p>In two identically designed Phase 3 studies of tofacitinib induction therapy for patients with moderately to severely active UC, statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in HRQoL were observed with tofacitinib 10 mg BID versus placebo, as evidenced by improvement in clinical outcomes and PROs based on the IBDQ and SF-36v2. A significant treatment effect was observed with tofacitinib 10 mg BID versus placebo as early as Week 4 [first post-baseline IBDQ assessment] in the induction studies. In a subsequent Phase 3 maintenance study of tofacitinib, improvements gained by patients during the induction studies were maintained with tofacitinib 5 mg BID and tofacitinib 10 mg BID, but not with placebo. Analyses of HRQoL in subgroups showed a generally consistent effect of treatment regardless of corticosteroid use at baseline, gender, and previous anti-TNF therapy. Patient SF-36v2 scores decreased significantly when treated with placebo in the maintenance study.</p><p>These results are consistent with the primary efficacy analyses of OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2, and OCTAVE Sustain,<sup><xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></sup> where significant improvements in clinical symptoms and endoscopic disease severity were observed with tofacitinib induction therapy and maintained with tofacitinib maintenance therapy.</p><p>The importance of assessing HRQoL in clinical trials evaluating new therapies for UC is reflected in draft US Food and Drug Administration guidance to industry.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> This guidance advises that ideal assessment of efficacy for UC therapies should comprise a PRO assessment of signs and symptoms of disease, complemented by a clinician-reported endoscopic and histological evaluation.<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In these analyses, we observed significant, but not strong, correlation between HRQoL endpoints and clinical efficacy in both OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 and in OCTAVE Sustain. This result is not surprising as the Pearson correlation coefficient, which assumes that two variables follow an underlying continuous [normal] distribution, is expected to attenuate the true relationship between two variables when at least one variable is taken as binary rather than quantitative.<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> A more representative metric to obtain such a true relationship is found using percentages or means, which were reported throughout the manuscript. Moreover, although improvement in clinical measures of disease may correlate with HRQoL at the population level,<sup><xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> some patients&#x02019; HRQoL may still be impaired despite achieving clinical goals of therapy such as mucosal healing.<sup><xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Accordingly, HRQoL outcomes are important in assessing the effect of UC therapies on how patients feel and their ability to function in daily life.<sup><xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;23</xref></sup> Improvements in HRQoL observed during the OCTAVE Phase 3 programme were consistent with those observed with biological therapies for the treatment of UC&#x02500;infliximab,<sup><xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> vedolizumab,<sup><xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and adalimumab<sup><xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup>&#x02500;where clinical efficacy was demonstrated along with improvements in HRQoL and functional outcomes.</p><p>Generic measures of patients&#x02019; functioning and well-being, such as the SF-36v2, allow the assessment of whether patients experience improvement in HRQoL, but also whether they become &#x02018;well&#x02019; or normalised: that is, whether their post-treatment scores are comparable to a normal reference group [ie the 1998 US age- and gender-matched normative population]. This approach to assessing treatment benefit is widely adopted in other therapeutic areas, most notably in rheumatology, where a goal of treatment is for the patient to not only feel better but also to achieve levels of functioning and well-being that are measurably &#x02018;normal&#x02019; for the patient&#x02019;s age and gender.<sup><xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Mean SF-36v2 PCS and MCS scores at baseline of OCTAVE Induction 1 and OCTAVE Induction 2 ranged from 40.2 to 41.5 and 37.8 to 39.0, respectively, across treatment groups. By comparison, the PCS and MCS scores were 39.0 and 51.9, respectively, for patients with prostate cancer in treatment<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref>; 31.7 and 47.3, respectively, for hospitalised dialysis patients<xref rid="CIT0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>40</sup></xref>; and 34.4 and 49.6, respectively, for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<sup><xref rid="CIT0041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> The <italic>post hoc</italic> analyses performed in these studies demonstrated age- and gender-related induction baseline decrements in HRQoL, as reflected by SF-36v2 data, which were subsequently improved toward normalised status with tofacitinib therapy during the induction studies, but not with placebo. Furthermore, during OCTAVE Sustain, this normalised status was generally maintained with tofacitinib treatment but not with placebo.</p><p>A limitation of these analyses is that the OCTAVE Sustain maintenance study assessed treatment effect in patients who had already demonstrated clinical response in the induction phase. Although this reflects real-life practice, where patients only continue therapy in the case of initial response, further data from the ongoing open-label extension study of tofacitinib in UC [OCTAVE Open; NCT01470612] are required to assess HRQoL improvements in patients who failed to respond to induction treatment. The analyses comparing SF-36v2 scores in OCTAVE Induction 1 and 2 and OCTAVE Sustain versus age- and gender-matched norms were not prespecified analyses, and should be interpreted cautiously. In addition, during OCTAVE Sustain, a greater proportion of patients in the placebo group discontinued the study compared with patients receiving tofacitinib 5 mg BID and 10 mg BID. This should be taken into account when interpreting the efficacy analyses based on observed case data.</p><p>In conclusion, induction therapy with tofacitinib 10 mg BID significantly improved HRQoL as early as 4 weeks in patients with moderately to severely active UC. In patients with clinical response in the induction studies, improvements in HRQoL gained during the induction studies were maintained with tofacitinib 5 mg BID and tofacitinib 10 mg BID and were significantly better than with placebo throughout 52 weeks of maintenance therapy.</p></sec><sec id="s23"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by Pfizer Inc.
