Oocyte cryopreservation has been performed in several mammalian species; however, success rates have been low due to oocytes&#x02019; unique structure and sensitivity to cooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Slow freezing and vitrification are two common methods of cryopreservation for mammalian oocytes and embryos. In conventional, slow (controlled) freezing, cells dehydrate because of increased salt concentrations in the extracellular compartment resulting in a reduced likelihood of intracellular ice formation, but this results in increased intracellular salt concentrations referred to as the &#x0201c;solution effect&#x0201d; which can also cause cell damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Alternately, vitrification exposes cells to relatively high concentrations of cryoprotectants and ultra-rapid cooling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Vitrification is used to avoid chilling injury and ice crystal formation in the cryopreservation of tissue, embryos and oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Although vitrification does not require a sophisticated and expensive programmable cell freezer, and is a fairly quick procedure, it requires skill and experience.</p><p>Vitrification involves ultra-rapid cooling and results in glass formation due to high viscosity of the cryoprotectants in intra- and extra-cellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Although mouse oocytes have been vitrified successfully [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], vitrification of bovine oocytes is challenging due to their complex structure and sensitivity to chilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Previously, we examined the effect of vitrification of bovine oocytes on nuclear maturation, cleavage and blastocyst development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and found that vitrified oocytes had reduced embryo developmental competence, as indicated by low blastocyst production rates (&#x0003c;5%) compared to non-vitrified controls (31%).</p><p>One of the biophysical factors causing cellular disruption during cryopreservation is intracellular ice formation. However, vitrification reduces or eliminates intracellular ice formation by using highly viscous cryoprotectant solutions at relatively high concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol and dimethyl sulfoxide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] are used as permeating cryoprotectants for oocyte vitrification. Despite the critical importance of cryoprotectants for avoiding ice crystal formation in oocytes, the high concentration of cryoprotectants required for vitrification may be toxic and may cause osmotic injury to the cells, leading to reduced developmental competence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To investigate the reduced developmental competence of oocytes following vitrification, it is important to examine the individual components of the vitrification system. Therefore, we proposed to determine the role of high concentrations of cryoprotectants present in vitrification solutions on cleavage rate of vitrified bovine oocytes and subsequent embryo development.</p><p>Warming time is a function of the temperature of the warming solution, and the sample volume and thickness which affects heat transfer. During the warming process, the oocytes are brought to the same temperature as the warming solution at an extremely high rate. The exposure to the warming solution is essential not only for warming, but also for removing cryoprotectants and rehydrating the oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Oocyte swelling during warming is an important determining factor for survival as volume fluctuations affect the plasma membrane integrity and organization of the cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. When exposed to an isotonic solution directly, water diffuses into the cell more rapidly than the cryoprotectants flow out and osmotic swelling can occur beyond the volume limits of the oocyte, resulting in membrane damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thus, the warming solution normally contains a nonpermeating cryoprotectant such as sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. If the time in the warming solution is insufficient, cryoprotectants may not be completely removed; however, the appropriate time interval for vitrified oocytes in the warming solution is still unclear. With this background, we hypothesized that 1) the high concentrations of cryoprotectants used in vitrification procedures would have toxic effects on bovine cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs), resulting in low cleavage and embryonic developmental rates, and 2) exposing vitrified COCs to the warming solution containing sucrose for a longer interval would improve cleavage and blastocyst production rates by permitting the complete removal of intracellular cryoprotectants. Therefore, the present studies aimed to investigate the effects of the exposure of bovine COCs to vitrification solutions, the vitrification procedure, and time in the warming solution on cleavage and subsequent embryo development following <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study was approved by the Animal Care Committee and Animal Research Ethics Board, University of Saskatchewan, Saskatoon, Canada.</p><sec><title>Chemicals and supplies</title><p>Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate buffered saline (DPBS), newborn calf serum (CS), TCM-199 and MEM non-essential amino acids were purchased from Invitrogen Inc.

sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In order to achieve intracellular vitrification, there are three main requirements i.e., high concentrations of permeating cryoprotectants, ultra-rapid cooling and low sample volume. Alteration in any one of these components can affect the success of the vitrification process. High concentrations of cryoprotectants are used to increase the viscosity of intra- and extra-cellular solutions, which increases the glass transition temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Ethylene glycol (EG) and DMSO are commonly used cryoprotectants in vitrification, but they are considered toxic due to their cell permeating nature and the high concentrations needed to induce vitrification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. Ultra-rapid cooling allows the addition of permeating cryoprotectants at lower concentrations reducing toxicity to the cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Decreasing the sample volume during the vitrification procedure increases the cooling rate which improves heat transfer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In the present study, the most profound and consistent observation was that the high concentrations of cryoprotectants used (15% EG and DMSO) had no adverse effect on cleavage and blastocyst production rates. Similarly, exposure of vitrified oocytes to the warming solution containing sucrose for 5&#x02009;min did not affect cleavage and blastocyst production, as compared to 1&#x02009;min, regardless of group. On the contrary, vitrification of the GV stage oocytes affected cleavage rates and blastocyst rates profoundly following in vitro maturation and fertilization. In both experiments, the cleavage rates were significantly reduced in the Vitrified group and blastocyst rates were not only significantly reduced, but were exceptionally low. Although these experiments were not designed to determine the necessity of sucrose in the warming solution, it is difficult to imagine that the absence of sucrose in the warming solution could be anything but detrimental. Thus, we concluded that our vitrification procedure was deficient in one or more ways for the cryopreservation of germinal vesicle stage bovine oocytes.</p><p>In the current studies, cleavage and blastocyst production rates in the VS1&#x02009;+&#x02009;VS2 group did not differ from that in the Control group (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). This suggests that the 45&#x02013;60&#x02009;sec exposure time was not sufficient for permeating these cryoprotectants to penetrate inside the bovine oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], or if penetrated, DMSO and EG had no toxic effects on bovine oocytes. Although there is still considerable debate, published literature tends to confirm the likelihood that these cryoprotectants are not highly toxic. DMSO alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] or in combination with other cryoprotectants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] has been used successfully for oocyte vitrification, and in at least one study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>], the exclusion of DMSO from vitrification solution resulted in lower survival rates of oocytes. However, it has also been reported that DMSO (used alone or in combination with EG) resulted in reduced developmental competence of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In other studies, DMSO-free vitrification systems e.g., glycerol and propanediol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>], or ethylene glycol and sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>], have provided promising results with oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>An ultra-rapid cooling rate is generally considered as one of the requirements for successful vitrification. Recently, ultra-rapid warming has been reported to be more important than concentrations of cryoprotectants or cooling rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The optimal warming time for vitrified bovine oocytes is still unknown. However, exposing oocytes to the warming solution for 5&#x02009;min as opposed to 1&#x02009;min in Experiment 2 appeared to have no obvious benefit on subsequent embryo development. Therefore, 1&#x02009;min appears to be a sufficient time in the warming solution. It is also noteworthy that exposure to the warming solution containing sucrose for either 1 or 5&#x02009;min did not have any adverse effect in nonvitrified oocytes in the VS1 and VS1&#x02009;+&#x02009;VS2 groups.</p><p>Osmotic stress resulting from exposure to high concentrations of cryoprotectants in vitrification solutions could cause oocytes to undergo dramatic volume changes during warming. In this regard, one of the most important factors affecting cell survival during dilution is excessive cell swelling. Water moves through the cell membrane more rapidly than cryoprotectants, and because of the high concentration of cryoprotectants remaining in the cell, swelling occurs. Oocytes have biological limits in their tolerance to the osmotic stress associated with high concentrations of cryoprotectants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Volume fluctuations can affect the integrity of the plasma membrane as well as the cytoskeletal organization of oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. During this process, oocytes are rehydrated while cryoprotectants and water are exchanged due to their gradients across the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. For this reason, sucrose is commonly used in warming solution to counterbalance the osmotic shock during conventional freezing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and vitrification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Although these experiments were not designed to determine the benefits of sucrose in the warming solution, there was no evidence for any adverse effects.</p><p>Bovine oocytes at different nuclear stages (germinal vesicle, metaphase I and metaphase II) have been cryopreserved successfully, using both slow freezing or vitrification methods. Mature oocytes have meiotic spindles that are extremely sensitive to cryoprotectant additives and cooling rates which result in tubulin depolymerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Therefore, immature oocytes (GV stage) enclosed in cumulus cells (COCs) were used in the current study. The role of cumulus cells during oocyte cryopreservation is still not clear. Cumulus cells provide a rigid structure to oocytes and thus protect them against osmotic shock during cryopreservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. It has been reported that the survival, cleavage and blastocyst production rates of bovine oocytes were higher when vitrified with enclosed cumulus cells than partially denuded COCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], as cumulus cells support the oocyte during <italic>in vitro</italic> maturation and fertilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p><p>Cryopreservation of oocytes has been reported to result in several ultrastructural and morphological alterations including damage to the cell membrane and ooplasm, and abnormal distribution of chromosomes, microtubules and actin microfilaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>]. Additionally, damage to gap junction integrity can result in disruption of the communication between cumulus cells and oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>]. These morphological changes have been linked to a failure in fertilization and embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Consequently, the disruptions in protein synthesis, and the failure of cumulus cell expansion and further meiotic development may also be responsible for the failure of cleavage and subsequent embryo development following vitrification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>].</p><p>In a recent study, only 23% of vitrified COCs (GV stage) reached the MII stage following IVM as compared to 84% in nonvitrified control COCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. In another study using similar vitrification conditions (15% EG and DMSO in VS2, 45&#x02013;60&#x02009;sec exposure time and cryotop as a loading device), cleavage and blastocyst production rates were somewhat higher than in the present study, but still low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. It is noteworthy that in the present study, cleavage and blastocyst rates were based on the original number of oocytes (COCs) that were vitrified. Thus, data have been presented and interpreted very conservatively. Based on these results and published literature, we must conclude that the optimum vitrification procedure for GV stage oocytes has yet not been developed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The brief exposure (45&#x02013;60&#x02009;sec) of immature (GV stage) bovine COCs to vitrification solutions (15% of each EG and DMSO) did not adversely affect their subsequent cleavage and embryo development. There was no apparent cytotoxic effect and there was no evidence that osmotic stress was responsible for the low blastocyst production rates following vitrification. Furthermore, 5&#x02009;min exposure to the warming solution had no added benefits over 1&#x02009;min, with regards to cleavage and blastocyst production rates. Collectively, data provide evidence suggesting that the vitrification procedure was responsible for the reduced cleavage and embryo development rates following vitrification and warming.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>COCs: Cumulus-oocyte complexes; GV: Germinal vesicle; VS: Vitrification solution; EG: Ethylene glycol; DMSO: Dimethyl sulfoxide; CS: Calf serum; TCM-199: Tissue Culture Medium-199; IIF: Intracellular ice formation; DPBS: Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate buffered saline; MEM: Minimum Essential Medium; IVM: In vitro maturation; IVF: In vitro fertilization; BO: Brackett-Oliphant; IVC: In vitro culture; BSA: Bovine serum albumin.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>JRP conducted the experiments, analyzed the data and wrote the draft of manuscript.
