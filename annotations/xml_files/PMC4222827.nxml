Nevertheless, cognitive impairment may improve or deteriorate following a stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Risk factors for cognitive decline include executive dysfunction, white matter hyperintensities (WMH), ApoE e4 status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and atrophy of crucial brain areas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Many potential interventions for preventing cognitive decline have been proposed, including blood pressure (BP) and lipid lowering, antiplatelet agents, anti-oxidant vitamins, and cholinesterase inhibitors. Of these, lowering BP and blood lipids are priorities for testing.</p></sec><sec><title>Blood pressure lowering</title><p>Lowering BP post-stroke is highly effective in reducing recurrent and other vascular events, as shown in individual trials (such as Post-stroke Antihypertensive Treatment Study (PATS, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5,665) and Perindopril protection against recurrent stroke study (PROGRESS, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;6,105) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]) and a meta-analysis of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. However, the effect on cognitive function of lowering BP is far less clear.</p><p>Longitudinal studies have shown that premorbid high systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) are associated with WMH and an increased risk of Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD) and vascular dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Although no trials have been expressly designed to test the effect of lowering BP on subsequent cognition post-stroke, several have included cognition as a secondary outcome measure. Whilst potential benefit was seen in the PROGRESS study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>], none was found in the Prevention Regimen for Effectively Avoiding Second Strokes trial (PRoFESS, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20,332) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Similar mixed results have been seen in trials of BP lowering in non-stroke populations, for example, the Hypertension in the Very Elderly Trial (HYVET, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,845) and Systolic Hypertension in Europe (Syst-Eur, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;4,695) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. In a meta-analysis involving both stroke and non-stroke patients, lowering BP was associated with less cognitive decline, and a trend to less dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]; meta-regression suggested that the degree of reduction in cognition was related to the magnitude of BP lowering.</p><p>The Secondary Prevention of Small Subcortical Strokes (SPS3, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;3,020) factorial trial of intensive versus guideline BP lowering, and aspirin/clopidogrel versus aspirin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], in patients with MRI-proven lacunar stroke will be presenting the effects of intensive BP lowering on cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>] in 2014. The ongoing PRESsure in established cERebral small VEssel disease (PRESERVE, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;422) trial is also investigating the effect of lowering BP in patients with established cerebral small vessel disease (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN37694103">http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN37694103</ext-link>, downloaded 20 June 2013).</p></sec><sec><title>Lipid lowering</title><p>The majority of information on lipid lowering and cognition relates to statins rather than older interventions such as fibrates, nicotinic acid derivatives or resins. Statins have pleiotropic effects that include lowering cholesterol (specifically low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-c)) and reducing platelet activity, inflammation and the release of cytokines and acute phase reactants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. These effects might limit the progression of Alzheimer&#x02019;s pathology from an asymptomatic state to symptomatic, or deterioration after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Although statins are one of the most widely prescribed drugs with clear health benefits in reducing vascular events, including stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], and death, there is little direct evidence that lipid lowering prevents cognitive decline in either people with normal cognition or patients with cognitive impairment.</p><p>The Heart Protection Study (HPS, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;20,536) found significant reductions in coronary artery and cerebrovascular events with simvastatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] but there was no difference in cognition on treatment (baseline measures were not taken so change could not be assessed), assessed using the Telephone Interview for Cognitive Status (TICS), even when sub-groups of older patients, and those with prior stroke, were analysed. Similarly, the Pravastatin in elderly individuals at risk of vascular disease (PROSPER, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;5,804) trial in people aged 70 to 82 with vascular risk factors reported no effect on cognition (measured using Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Stroop and a series of psychometric tests) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. A meta-analysis of three trials found a non-significant trend to higher MMSE scores in patients with AD who were randomised to statin treatment (atorvastatin, simvastatin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p><p>Thus, there is no clear evidence that statins reduce the risk of cognitive decline or dementia but this has not been formally examined in a high-risk population. In contrast, there has been some concern that statins are associated with reversible cognitive impairment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>], either due to an idiosyncratic response to statins or an underlying mitochondrial dysfunction.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>To develop interventions to prevent cognitive decline and dementia after stroke.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary objectives</title><sec><title>Start-up phase</title><p>To determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining patients, and identify any barriers to achieving BP and lipid targets.</p></sec><sec><title>Main phase</title><p>To determine if &#x02018;intensive&#x02019; blood pressure lowering therapy, and/or &#x02018;intensive&#x02019; lipid lowering therapy, after stroke reduces cognitive decline and dementia.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Secondary objectives</title><sec><title>Start-up phase</title><p>To determine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining sites, reaching and maintaining target BP and lipid levels, performing cognitive assessment in clinic and by telephone, and the tolerability and safety of the management strategies.</p></sec><sec><title>Main phase</title><p>To determine if &#x02018;intensive&#x02019; blood pressure lowering therapy, and/or &#x02018;intensive&#x02019; lipid lowering therapy, after stroke reduces poor quality of life, poor function, depression, stroke recurrence, vascular events, and death.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Aims</title><sec><title>Start-up phase</title><p>This is assessing the:</p><p>&#x02022;Ability to deliver the protocol</p><p>&#x02022;Ability to recruit 30 recruiting sites</p><p>&#x02022;Ability to recruit and retain 600 participants</p><p>&#x02022;Ability to achieve and maintain differences in systolic BP&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;10&#x000a0;mmHg and LDL-c&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;1&#x000a0;mmol/l between the &#x02018;intensive&#x02019; and &#x02018;guideline&#x02019; treatment groups</p><p>&#x02022;Ability to perform clinic and telephone follow-up of outcome measures</p><p>&#x02022;Sensitivity of the Addenbrooke&#x02019;s Cognitive Examination-R (ACE-R) and other cognitive measures to change over time</p><p>&#x02022;Tolerability and safety of the intervention</p></sec><sec><title>Main phase</title><p>A main phase was planned to assess the safety and efficacy of intensive versus guideline BP and lipid management in preventing cognitive decline.

The trial requires both acute hospital trusts (who identify patients, manage intensive BP and/or lipid lowering, and perform clinic follow-ups) and general practices, through Primary Care Trusts (PCTs, who manage guideline BP and/or lipid management), to sign-up.

It has proved difficult to coordinate the agreement to deliver the study in a locality between these acute and community trusts.</p><p>&#x02022;NHS Excess Treatment Costs.
