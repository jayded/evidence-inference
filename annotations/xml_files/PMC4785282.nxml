Clinical practice guidelines consistently recommend weight management as a core aspect of care for overweight and obese patients with knee OA; however, provision of such care is suboptimal. Telephone-based interventions offer a novel approach to delivery of weight management care in these patients. The aim of the proposed study is to assess the effectiveness of referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle programme, previously shown to be effective in changing weight, in improving knee pain intensity in overweight or obese patients with knee OA, compared to usual care.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A parallel, randomised controlled trial will be undertaken. Patients with OA of the knee who are waiting for an outpatient orthopaedic consultation at a tertiary referral public hospital within New South Wales, Australia, will be allocated to either an intervention or a control group (1:1 ratio). After baseline data collection, patients in the intervention group will receive a 6-month telephone-based intervention, and patients in the control group will continue with usual care. Surveys will be conducted at baseline, 6 and 26&#x02005;weeks post-randomisation. The study requires 60 participants per group to detect a two-point difference in pain intensity (primary outcome) 26&#x02005;weeks after baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study is approved by the Hunter New England Health Human Research Ethics Committee (13/12/11/5.18) and the University of Newcastle Human Research Ethics Committee (H-2015-0043).

<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> The aetiology of OA is multifactorial including mechanical, inflammatory, metabolic and social factors leading to chronic pain, stiffness and reduced joint function.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> According to the 2010 Global Burden of Disease Study, OA contributed to more than 17 million years lived with disability, 83% of which was attributed to OA of the knee.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In 2013, there were over 240 million cases of OA reported worldwide.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As a consequence, OA imposes a significant economic burden on individuals and society.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>
<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> The cost of OA has previously been recorded to account for between 1% and 2.5% of the gross national product in the UK, the USA, Canada, France and Australia.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> The knee is the most common and burdensome joint affected by OA, with a lifetime prevalence of knee OA of 40% in men and 47% in women.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>There are many risk factors for knee OA, including non-modifiable factors such as being female, or aged over 45&#x02005;years, and advancing age, and modifiable behavioural factors such as excess weight, inactivity and joint injury.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Being overweight or obese is the single most important modifiable behavioural risk factor for the onset and progression of knee OA.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9&#x02013;11</xref> Increased mechanical load on joints, increased inflammatory mediators contributing to joint degradation and other systemic metabolic effects<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> are suggested as underlying mechanisms for the relationship between excess weight and OA. Importantly, weight loss interventions reduce pain and disability in overweight or obese patients with knee OA.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> A systematic review and meta-analysis of four randomised controlled trials (RCT) reported that behavioural weight loss interventions lead to moderate improvements in pain and physical function (pooled effect sizes 0.2 and 0.23, respectively) for adults with knee OA who are overweight or obese.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Further analysis showed that achieving at least 5% weight loss was a precursor to symptom improvement.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></p><p>Clinical practice guidelines consistently recommend several core treatments for patients with knee OA including routine provision of weight loss care; advice and education about the condition; and advice on general low-impact aerobic fitness and muscle strengthening exercises.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> Guidelines recommend that these treatments be provided to all patients with knee OA irrespective of age, comorbidity, stage or severity of the condition or the setting of care, and prior to surgical interventions.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;19</xref> However, the provision of such care across all healthcare settings is suboptimal.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20&#x02013;23</xref> Data from the Australian Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health Study reveals, on average, that only 18 in 100 people with knee OA attending a general practitioner (GP) were provided with lifestyle management (including weight management), while 12 in 100 were referred for orthopaedic consultation.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> A recent Australian study of patients with hip or knee OA awaiting orthopaedic consultation found that only 20% felt they had received education about their condition, prognosis and treatment options.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Although 89% of patients were overweight or obese, only 22% reported that they engaged in weight loss strategies, and &#x0003c;25% had been supported to undertake physical activity.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> These results indicate that the majority of patients are referred for orthopaedic consultation without having previously attempted any lifestyle modification, and in particular, weight loss interventions.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>
<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Traditionally, behavioural interventions targeting weight and activity have been provided to patients in clinical face-to-face programmes.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> While such face-to-face interventions have achieved weight loss between 5% and 12% when targeting behaviour changes including diet and exercise in people with knee OA,<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> these modes of delivery have limited accessibility and reach due to the lack of availability of clinicians to provide interventions, their high cost, and the time and travel requirements for patients.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The development of more accessible modes of care could improve the delivery of care to support behaviour change, weight loss and increased physical activity for patients with knee OA. Encouragingly, behavioural interventions for physical activity, diet and weight loss delivered by telephone have been shown to be just as effective as face-to-face interventions in the general population,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>
<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> yet their reach is far greater. Systematic reviews have found strong evidence to support the efficacy of telephone-delivered interventions for improving the behavioural determinants of weight, diet and physical activity in both healthy participants and those with chronic disease.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Four RCTs using telephone-based coaching interventions to reduce pain in adults with knee OA have been conducted.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;34</xref> These multicomponent interventions targeted several patient behaviours such as mobility, medication compliance, stress control, weight management, improved sleep quality and increased communication with healthcare providers with the goal to improve overall self-management. These previous studies provide evidence to support telephone as an effective and acceptable modality for care delivery among this patient group.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>
<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32&#x02013;34</xref> While weight loss is a core recommendation for patients with knee OA, and was included in one of the prior studies as a small subcomponent, none of these previous studies primarily focused on weight loss. We have chosen to test this in a pragmatic trial by referring patients to an existing telephone-based weight loss intervention.</p><p>The primary objective of this trial is to assess the effectiveness of referral to a telephone-based weight management and healthy lifestyle programme in reducing the intensity of knee pain in overweight or obese patients with knee OA who are referred for outpatient orthopaedic consultation, compared with usual care. Secondary objectives are to assess if the intervention improves disability and function, anthropometry (weight, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference), quality of life, diet, physical activity and healthcare usage compared with usual care at 26&#x02005;weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and setting</title><p>The study will employ a parallel group randomised controlled design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015010203F1">figure 1</xref>). The trial is part of a cohort multiple RCT,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> which has been embedded into routine service. This pragmatic design uses participants from our existing cohort of patients waiting for orthopaedic consultation; patients are randomised to be offered a new clinical intervention (intervention group), or to remain part of the cohort (control group). As the trial is presented as routine service, only the patients randomised to the intervention group are made aware of the intervention components. The control group is unaware of the intervention group and is asked to participate in routine follow-up for the cohort, and is informed that a clinical appointment will be available in the next 6&#x02005;months.
