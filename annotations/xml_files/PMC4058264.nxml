Introduction</title><p>
Coronary heart disease causes huge damage in human health and lives. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), which greatly reduce the incidence of cardiovascular events and alleviate the symptoms, are widely used in clinical treatment since the development of modern medicine. However, the effects of both treatments on preventing restenosis after revascularization and improving the quality of life were not satisfying. Recent studies had showed that traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) has advantages in preventing restenosis after PCI and improving the quality of life, but these trials had limited internal validity due to poor design and small sample size.</p><p>Huxin Formula is formulated by modifying an experienced Chinese medicine formula which is created by a well-known Chinese doctor, Professor DENG Tie-tao, and has been widely used in clinical practice due to its marked effects on coronary heart disease.</p><p>In this trial, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of Huxin Formula in patients after PCI using a multicenter, double-blind, randomized, and placebo-controlled clinical trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Subjects</title><p>Participants were screened by investigators at 12 first-rate domestic hospitals in China, including Guangdong Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital, Xinjiang Hospital of Chinese Medicine, Jiangsu Provincial Hospital of Chinese Medicine, The No. 10 Hospital of Shanghai, Shanxi Provincial People's Hospital, Gansu Provincial People's Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou University of TCM, Huaqiao Hospital of Jinan University, Jiangmen Wuyi Hospital of TCM, and People's Hospital of Liuzhou. The study was conducted between April 2008 and December 2010. Patients were assessed according to ESC 2006 guidelines for management of patients with stable angina and ACC/AHA 2005 guidelines for management of patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction. The inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>. Patients were free to withdraw from the study at any time. Potential participants who were interested in this study received a complete explanation of the protocol and signed the consent form. The ethical approval for the study was granted by the Ethics Committee of Guangzhou University of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Design, Randomization, and Allocation</title><p>A double-blind randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted by using stratified randomized method. Center is a stratified factor in the present trial. Eligible participants after PCI were randomly assigned into 2 groups: treatment group who received conventional treatment and Huxin Formula or control group who received conventional treatment and the placebo. A sample size calculation based on the incidence rate of cardiovascular events in previous studies determined that 289 patients were needed to reduce the incidence rate of cardiovascular events of 8.5% (power 0.85, significance level 0.05). With an estimated 15% dropout rate, we set the total sample size at 680. Randomized codes were performed with SAS6.12 (statistical software package UNIFORM(n)). Eligible patients at each center were assigned randomization numbers from Institute of Basic Medical and Clinical Sciences, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, which is responsible for the randomization of this research and was external to the trial. Participants and investigators were masked to group assignment. The prepared drugs were dispensed in similar looking bags, and the nature of the drug was concealed by the providers. The random allocation sequence was concealed until the data collection for the entire study was completed.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Treatment Protocols</title><p>Patients in the treatment group were provided Huxin Formula (in the form of granules) prepared by Jiangyin Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu, China). Every 10&#x02009;g Huxin Formula granules consisted of ginseng (10&#x02009;g), Exocarpium Citri Rubrum (5&#x02009;g),<italic> Panax pseudoginseng</italic> (8&#x02009;g),<italic> Pinellia ternata</italic> (10&#x02009;g),<italic> Salvia miltiorrhiza</italic> (10&#x02009;g), and<italic> Agastache</italic> (10&#x02009;g) as crude drug. Patients in the control group were given placebo granules prepared by the same supplier. Placebo granules were designed to taste, smell, and look similar to Huxin Formula. Placebo consisted of amylum, bitter principle, excipient, and so forth. Huxin Formula or placebo was used once a day (10&#x02009;g QD) after fully dissolving in 300&#x02009;mL of boiled water cooled to 70&#x000b0;C. Treatment started in one week after PCI and continued for 6 months (180 days). Then patients were followed up for another 6 months (180 days).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Outcomes</title><p>The baseline data, including gender, age, personal history, medical history, family history of cardiovascular disease, classification of cardiac function, and clinical classification of coronary heart disease, were assessed. Main cardiovascular events (death, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and repeat revascularization) were also observed and recorded. We assessed quality of life using two scales: (1) Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) and (2) scale of the life quality in integrative medicine for CAD (see Supplementary Material available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/143064">http://dx.doi.org/10.1155/2014/143064</ext-link>). The outcomes were assessed at 0, 90, 180, 270, and 360 days after treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Safety Monitoring</title><p>To assess the safety of the 6-month treatment, routine blood and liver and renal function tests were conducted before randomization, 90 days and 180 days after treatment. During the trial, adverse events were observed in detail and documented using case report forms.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.6"><title>2.6.

Discussion</title><p>Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major cause of mortality and morbidity in developed countries [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Before developing the technique of PCI, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) had been the standard and the only revascularization procedure. With the development of medical imaging and heart catheterization techniques, the PCI, as an effective, safe, less disabling, and less expensive revascularization procedure, had become a more frequently used treatment than CABG for CAD in most western countries as well as in China. Growing evidence had showed that PCI can improve myocardial ischemia and reduce the risks of long-term adverse cardiovascular events [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The results of a meta-analysis of 13 randomized controlled trials showed that PCI with drug-eluting stents reduces the risks of major adverse cardiac events, recurrent myocardial infarction, and reintervention [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, other than biochemical endpoints, quality of life (QoL) is considered to be an important indicator of health outcome in CAD [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and the most common indication for PCI [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) was the most commonly used instrument to capture comprehensive and sensitive changes in QoL of the cardiac patients [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Besides SAQ, scale of the life quality in integrative medicine for CAD, which was established for the first time, was used in the present research. The internal reliability of this scale was supported by the values of Cronbach's <italic>&#x003b1;</italic> that exceeded 0.7 for all the subscales. Scale of the life quality in integrative medicine for CAD was used to collect the mental and social functioning information that SAQ might have missed.</p><p>Although the role of PCI in chronic stable angina is well established as it alleviates ischemic symptoms and improves quality of life [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], its benefit in general health status of patients with unstable angina and non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (UA/NSTEMI) would not be sufficient. It is reported that poor QoL is highly prevalent in elderly patients undergoing PCI [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. At 30 days after PCI, general health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was significantly lower (0.86 &#x000b1; 0.21 versus 0.89 &#x000b1; 0.17, <italic>P</italic> = 0.001) after adjusting baseline characteristics (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Therefore, in addition to angina-specific therapy, comprehensive supportive care would be needed to improve the quality of life, which might improve long-term clinical outcome especially in patients after PCI.</p><p>According to the 2007 ACCF/AHA guidelines for the management of patients with unstable angina/non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], clopidogrel is recommend to be used for at least one year. Lipid-lowering therapy with the use of statin has benefits in blocking the progression of coronary artery plaque and further preventing cardiovascular events and death [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, effects of these treatments on relieving the symptoms and improving quality of life are not satisfying.</p><p>It is reported that some kinds of herbal medicine, such as Xuefu Zhuyu Capsule [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], exhibit better efficacy on HRQoL in patients with unstable angina after PCI. However, the application of TCM in the post-PCI patients still lacks support from rigorously designed clinical trial. Huxin Formula is formulated by modifying an experienced Chinese medicine formula which is created by a well-known Chinese doctor, Professor DENG Tie-tao, and has been widely used in clinical practice because of its marked effects on coronary heart disease [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Our earlier clinical study in 55 patients after CABG had showed that modified Huxin Formula can promote rehabilitation of the CABG patients, improving clinical symptoms and quality of life [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, the effects of the formula in patients undergoing PCI were unknown. Therefore, the present study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Huxin Formula in patients after PCI.</p><p>Our results showed that, for patients with unstable angina, score of the quality of life scale in 360 days was significantly higher in treatment group (87.62 &#x000b1; 7.52) compared with control group (85.70 &#x000b1; 8.08) ( <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). This result suggested that Huxin Formula may improve the quality of life of patients after PCI compared to the placebo. There are 22 patients with the event of MACE (2 deaths, 6 repeat revascularizations, and 14 readmissions caused by cardiovascular events) in this research. The rate of one-year MACE event is only 3.23%, slightly lower than 5&#x02013;8% that has been suggested in foreign related reports. There was no statistical difference between the two groups in other outcomes. Limited sample size and the relatively short observational period may be the two reasons for the negative results. Therefore, further studies with larger sample sizes and longer observational period are warranted on the base of these precious experiences.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>In this research, the results showed that Huxin Formula is a safe treatment for patients after PCI. Though Huxin Formula failed to show superiority in primary and secondary outcomes, it has benefits in improving the quality of life in patients with unstable angina.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplementary-material-sec"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="f1"><caption><p>Scale of the life quality in integrative medicine for CAD, which was established for the first time, was used in the present research.
