Neonates are at risk of the obstructing effects of accumulating airway secretions, due to immaturity of the respiratory system (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). The excess of secretions can cause bronchial obstruction and lung collapse as a result of absorption of air beyond the obstruction. The presence of lung collapse may require further supports, such as additional oxygen and occasionally reintubation (in 10-30% of cases) for more mechanical ventilation (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>).</p><p>Chest physiotherapy, an airway clearance technique, is combined of chest wall percussion and vibrations, positioning of the patient for drainage of mucus, and cough and breathing techniques. The technique is believed to reduce respiratory complications through promoting clearance of secretions and consequently improving ventilation of the lungs (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Since late 1970s, the use of chest physiotherapy techniques for the prevention of postextubation lung collapse has become a part of routine care (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). Nevertheless, there are controversial findings in the literature regarding the effects of chest physiotherapy on the postextubation lung collapse in pediatric age group (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>-<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of chest physiotherapy in prevention of postextubation atelectasis in pediatric patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials &#x00026; Methods</title><p>In a case-control study from March 2007 to March 2011, 70 patients susceptible to lung collapse were enrolled in the study. </p><p>The patients who were extubated, were randomly divided in two groups (case and control).

This finding complements that of Finer et al. who investigated the role of chest physiotherapy in the prevention of postextubation atelectasis in neonates (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). In contrast, a few studies targeted at the role of chest physiotherapy in prevention of the postextubation atelectasis, did not support our finding. In a before-and-after study, Bloomfield et al. reported no benefit of postextubation chest physiotherapy in post extubation collapse (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). urthermore, Al-Alaiyan and colleagues stated that postextubation chest physiotherapy did not prevent atelectasis in extubated infants (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). In a study by Bagley et al., no significant difference was found in the rate of postextubation collapse between the chest physiotherapy group and control group (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>). In a systematic review, Flenady and Gray (2002) could not give a clear direction for the role of active chest physiotherapy for babies being extubated from mechanical ventilation in neonatal intensive care settings (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Their conclusion was based on the results of four trials (<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>), two of which were carried out several years ago (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Therefore, applicability of the results of these two studies to current practice might be compromised due to recent advancements in neonatal care (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>).</p><p>Apart from the role of chest physiotherapy in the prevention of postextubation atelectasis in neonates, the efficacy of this intervention has been assessed in prevention of postoperative atelectasis. Reines and coworkers demonstrated no benefit from the use of chest physiotherapy, routinely in their pediatric postoperative cardiac surgery patients (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). In addition, they warned the clinicians about the possible harmful outcome of application of the chest physiotherapy, that is, increased incidence of atelectasis in this group (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Contrarily, Cavenaghi et al. reviewed the relevant studies and highlighted the effectiveness of physiotherapy in reduction of the risk and/or treatment of pulmonary complications, such as atelectasis caused by surgical procedure in children with congenital heart disease (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). </p><p>On the other hand, Deakins and Chatburn compared intrapulmonary percussive ventilation with conventional chest physiotherapy to determine their effects on improving atelectasis in pediatric patients. They found that clinically important improvement in atelectasis was more detected in patients who received intrapulmonary percussive ventilation therapy compared to chest physiotherapy (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>). </p><p>In conclusion, conventional chest physiotherapy seems to be effective in the prevention of postextubation atelectasis in pediatric patients. It is recommended that further randomized controlled trials be performed with large number of infants in order to evaluate the role of prophylactic chest physiotherapy in the postextubation period in neonates and its adverse effects.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>We thank a lot the Paediatric Health Research Center for their support of this study and the Ethics
