However, the effect of antidepressant medications on human brain function is less clear and the effect of these drugs on resting-state functional connectivity is unknown.</p><p>Forty volunteers matched for age and gender with no previous psychiatric history received either citalopram (SSRI; selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitor), reboxetine (SNRI; selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor) or placebo for 7&#x000a0;days in a double-blind design. Using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging and seed based connectivity analysis we selected the right nucleus accumbens, the right amygdala, the subgenual cingulate and the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex as seed regions. Mood and subjective experience were also measured before and after drug administration using self-report scales.</p><p>Despite no differences in mood across the three groups, we found reduced connectivity between the amygdala and the ventral medial prefrontal cortex in the citalopram group and the amygdala and the orbitofrontal cortex for the reboxetine group.

Consistent with this idea, recent research examining emotional processing in depressed patients has also shown that dysfunctional activity in these regions is attenuated after pharmacological treatment and that this in turn correlates with treatment response (<xref rid="bb0055 bb0110 bb0150 bb0160 bb0295 bb0360 bb0365" ref-type="bibr">DeRubeis et al., 2005; Fu et al., 2004; Harmer et al., 2006; Hollon et al., 2005; Sheline et al., 2001; Victor et al., 2010; Wagner et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore a recent study in depressed patients examining orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) connectivity before and after antidepressant treatment found increased OFC connectivity prior to treatment differentiated responders from non-responders (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Lisiecka et al.</xref>).</p><p>Some preliminary examination of our resting-state dataset revealed decreased connectivity between the dmPFC and hippocampus following citalopram treatment compared to placebo (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2011</xref>). However, it is unknown whether this is a general effect of all antidepressants or specific to those with serotonergic action. Thus we decided to investigate the dmPFC connectivity in the reboxetine group and hypothesised that unlike citalopram, reboxetine would have its effects specifically in areas where catecholaminergic pathways have a role, such as the striatum and prefrontal cortex (<xref rid="bb0070 bb0225 bb0345" ref-type="bibr">Eshel and Roiser; Mizoguchi et al., 2008; Valentini et al., 2004</xref>). We also decided to examine other seed regions within the affective network that we have shown in our previous studies to be modulated by reboxetine and citalopram during task-based fMRI such as the nucleus accumbens, the subgenual cingulate and the amygdala (<xref rid="bb0155 bb0145 bb0215 bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Harmer et al., 2009, 2004; McCabe et al., 2010; Norbury et al., 2007</xref>). We investigated the effects in healthy volunteers with no history of depression or use of psychiatric medications. We hypothesised that antidepressant medications would decrease connectivity within the affective network and that this would be consistent with the recent hypotheses proposed by <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Sheline et al.

However, a meta-analysis of clinical trials has shown that, relative to placebo, SSRIs significantly decrease depressive symptomatology after 1&#x000a0;week of treatment (<xref rid="bb0340" ref-type="bibr">Taylor et al., 2006</xref>) and indeed the effect size of active treatment relative to placebo is numerically greater during the first week of therapy than in subsequent weeks. Further, it has been demonstrated in healthy volunteers that 7&#x000a0;days treatment with reboxetine produces positive biases in measures of emotional perception and memory, suggesting that therapeutically relevant changes in neuropsychological function are indeed apparent during the first week of antidepressant administration (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Harmer et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s0010"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s0015"><title>Participants</title><p>Forty healthy volunteers were randomised to receive 7&#x000a0;days oral treatment with citalopram (20&#x000a0;mg/day, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;12), reboxetine (4&#x000a0;mg/b.i.d., <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;13) or placebo (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;15), in a double blind between groups design.

Our results are the first to show that these areas which are known to be involved in the affective salience of stimuli, the representation of reward value and self-referential processing can be modulated by currently used antidepressant medications outside of a task situation and in unmedicated healthy control volunteers.</p><p>The OFC/vmPFC has been described as the principal mediator in a reciprocal relationship between the subcortical&#x02013;cortical regions in depression (<xref rid="bb0290" ref-type="bibr">Seminowicz et al., 2004</xref>) and a recent study has revealed aberrant mutual excitation between the medial prefrontal cortex and part of the ventral anterior cingulate in depressed patients which also positively correlated with increased scores on a depressive rumination scale (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>). This region is very close to the region of vmPFC that we have found to have reduced connectivity with the amygdala in the citalopram group (<xref rid="t0010" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;2</xref>). As the medial PFC has been reported to underlie the evaluation of the self (<xref rid="bb0130 bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Gusnard et al., 2001; Northoff and Bermpohl, 2004</xref>) it has been hypothesised that over activity in this region might be responsible for the maladaptive rumination seen in depression (<xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Hamilton et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore a recent study by <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Frodl et al. (2010)</xref> discusses how the integrative function of the OFC with its convergence of connections from the subcortical limbic regions is a key player in the pathophysiology of major depression (<xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Frodl et al., 2010</xref>). Disrupted connectivity between the vmPFC/OFC and regions outlined here such as the amygdala and the striatum may thus underlay the aberrant negative and positive emotional processing witnessed in depression. Specifically related to the recent <xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Sheline et al. (2010)</xref> study on resting-state functional connectivity in depressed patients we have previously examined the dmPFC (dorsal nexus) as a seed region and found that the antidepressant citalopram reduced the connectivity between the dmPFC and a part of the default mode network the hippocampus in our healthy volunteers, we concluded that antidepressant medications may work by reducing the aberrant increased connectivity seen in depression (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">McCabe et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly though in this study we did not find any effects of reboxetine on dmPFC connectivity. This may simply be due to power and perhaps with increased numbers of volunteers differences may have been revealed. Or it could also be due to the relatively less efficacious nature of reboxetine as a treatment for depression (<xref rid="bb0040 bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Cipriani et al., 2009; Eyding et al., 2010</xref>). Although we ran our resting-state approximately 10&#x02013;15&#x000a0;min after a task it is possible that examining resting-state after other tasks could effect the results and thus we intend for future experiments to run resting-state scans before any other tasks.</p><p>As hypothesised reboxetine decreased mesolimbic striatal&#x02013;OFC connectivity (indicating catecholaminergic pathway involvement) whereas citalopram decreased amygdala-vmPFC connectivity ((and in our previous study hippocampal&#x02013;dmPFC connectivity) indicating serotonergic pathway involvement). These results are consistent with recent studies in animals using pharmacological challenges to unpick rat brain connectivity. Schwarz and colleagues examined pharmacological challenges such as amphetamine (catecholamine) and fluoxetine (SSRI) on rat brain functional connectivity. Similarly they report that catecholaminergic drugs modulate striatal and prefrontal connections whereas serotonergic drugs modulate hippocampal, amygdala and thalamus connections (<xref rid="bb0285 bb0275 bb0280" ref-type="bibr">Schwarz et al., 2009; Schwarz et al., 2007a,b</xref>). Yet this is the first examination, to the best of our knowledge, of the effects of SSRI and SNRI antidepressant drug action in the resting human brain. Similar to Schwarz et al. we also found that the regions affected by the drugs closely reflect the known pathways in the neurotransmitter systems targeted by these drugs. Further work on receptor mapping would of course also aid our understanding of the brains architecture and would be especially relevant for pharmacological studies such as this (<xref rid="bb0390" ref-type="bibr">Zilles and Amunts, 2009</xref>).</p><p>There was no effect of either of the antidepressant medications on connectivity with the subgenual cingulate cortex seed, despite reports of increased subgenual connectivity in depressed patients resting-state data (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Sheline et al., 2010</xref>). The subgenual cingulate cortex is an important area targeted in deep brain stimulation for treatment-resistant depression (<xref rid="bb0185 bb0195 bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Kennedy et al., 2011; Lozano et al., 2008; Mayberg et al., 2005</xref>) perhaps then antidepressant improvement may lie in the development of drugs that can better target regions such as the subgenual cingulate cortex as well as the dmPFC (<xref rid="bb0305" ref-type="bibr">Sheline et al., 2010</xref>). The subgenual cingulate is also a region that is hard to image and thus it cannot be ruled out that our results might in some way reflect signal drop-out in this area.</p><p>In conclusion, the results from this study show that both serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressants decrease resting-state functional connectivity in areas of the brain that correspond with the central activity of these drugs. The results also support our hypothesis that antidepressant medications may work by rebalancing cortical control in depression. It will be of great interest to examine resting-state functional connectivity in unmedicated depressed patients before and after antidepressant treatment as the next step in unravelling antidepressant drug action at the neural level.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bb0005"><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Anand</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Y.</given-names></name><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Gao</surname><given-names>S.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bukhari</surname><given-names>L.</given-names></name><name><surname>Mathews</surname><given-names>V.P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Kalnin</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Lowe</surname><given-names>M.J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Activity and connectivity of brain mood regulating circuit in depression: a functional magnetic resonance study</article-title><source>Biol.
