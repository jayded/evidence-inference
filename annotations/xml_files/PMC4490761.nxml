Twenty-first century patients are looking for person-centred care: they want to be listened to and to have a dialogue with their doctor, to be healed rather than cured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The once-forgotten quality of empathy has been re-discovered as a desirable quality in doctors, and although it has been suggested that there are situations where objectivity may be more important [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], empathy has been shown to be associated with improved patient satisfaction and better clinical outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>What is empathy?</title><p>Although most people would claim to be able to recognise empathy, there is no agreed definition. One definition is &#x0201c;psychological processes that make an individual have feelings that are more congruent with another&#x02019;s situation than with his or her own&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Most definitions include the ability to understand and share others&#x02019; feelings, and are sometimes divided into two components, affective and cognitive. <bold>Cognitive empathy</bold>, also referred to as perspective-taking, is the ability to understand how another person feels and what they might be thinking. The second component of empathy, <bold>affective empathy</bold>, includes experiencing the emotions that the other person is feeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Some observers add an intention to help [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A related concept is affinity, our natural attraction to others. Larson and Yao have commented on the tendency we have to empathise with people who are like us, and to not empathise with people who are seen as &#x0201c;other&#x0201d; or different from us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Neurobiological correlates of empathy have been demonstrated. A meta-analysis of neuro-imaging research on empathy found that the dorsal part of the left anterior midcingulate cortex was found to be activated more frequently in the cognitive- evaluative form of empathy, while the right anterior insula was activated only in the affective-perceptive form of empathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Recent, though disputed research, suggests that &#x0201c;mirror neurons&#x0201d; may be &#x0201c;the neural basis of our empathic capacities&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>A number of approaches using the medical humanities have been advocated for teaching empathy to medical studentsx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. This paper describes a new approach using the medium of creative writing and a new narrative genre: &#x0201c;clinical realism&#x0201d;.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>What is clinical realism?</title><p>Clinical realism has its roots in the realism movement in art and literature in the nineteenth century. Realism, notes Morris, is &#x0201c;a literary form that has been associated with an insistence that art cannot turn away from the more sordid and harsh aspects of human existence&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Modernism aimed to render a full report of human experience through the use of details, and was portrayed by George Eliot as &#x0201c;old women scraping carrots with their work-worn hands&#x0201d; but also extended the subject matter of novels to incorporate class, gender, sexuality, and social reality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Although it was not seen as a separate movement at the time, a number of novelists such as Balzac, Flaubert, Eliot and Zola included realistic medical content in their novels. Rothfield analysed a selection of British and French medical realist novels, and noted that although realism is often equated with representation, the connection between medicine and realism varied with the purpose and period of the author. For example, he notes that the smallpox contracted by Mme. de Merteuil in <italic>Les Liasions Dangerouses</italic> serves as a metaphor which offers moral, social and narrative closure: &#x0201c;her disease had turned her round and&#x02026; now her soul is in her face.&#x0201d; We are told that she has been disfigured and has lost an eye, but there is no more detail about the disease. In contrast, Zola goes into graphic detail to discuss the smallpox which has killed his heroine in <italic>Nana,</italic> and which also perhaps, serves as a metaphor for the degeneration of an entire society: &#x0201c;the pustules had invaded the whole face, so that one pock touched the next. Withered and shrunken, they had taken on the greyish colour of mud&#x02026;&#x0201d; Rothfield argues that medicine provided novelists with narrative strategies, epistemological assumptions and models of professional authority, and early medical realist novels in particular tended to portray illness as &#x0201c;either a fundamental ontological predicament or a punctual sign of innate moral inadequacy&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Realism was replaced by other movements, including anti-realism, naturalism, detective fiction, modernism and post-modernism. In 1926, Virginia Woolf wrote an essay &#x0201c;On being ill&#x0201d;, commenting: &#x0201c;Considering how common illness is...... it becomes strange indeed that illness has not taken its place with love, battle and jealousy among the prime themes of literature&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. As Jurecic notes, the paucity of writing about illness seems even more remarkable when it is set against the fact that five per cent of the world's population had died in the flu epidemic of 1918/19, less than a decade before Woolf wrote her essay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Frank has commented on the rise of modernism, when &#x0201c;the medical chart became the official story of the illness&#x0201d;. He suggests that in post-modern time, people reclaimed the capacity for telling their own story [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Jurecic notes the flood of illness narratives that appeared in response to the emergence of HIV/AIDs in the late twentieth century, and the establishment of illness/disability narratives as a literary genre at around this time, albeit one that is not taken very seriously by critics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. The last decade has seen a similar explosion of graphic medicine accounts of illness. Graphic medicine explores the interaction between the medium of comics and the discourse of healthcare, and is allied to the graphic novel movement, which has produced &#x0201c;serious&#x0201d; comic books, aimed at adults. There are now numerous graphic medicine novels and autobiographies which recount illness narratives in cartoon form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. There remains, however, very little representation of physical health problems in literary fiction. ONS statistics for 2014 show that over 11 million people in the UK have a limiting long-term illness, impairment or disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] QoF (Quality and Outcomes Framework) statistics from GP practices for 2012/13 show that 13.7&#x000a0;% of registered patients have hypertension, 6.2&#x000a0;% have diabetes, 5.9&#x000a0;% have asthma, 4&#x000a0;% have chronic kidney disease, 3.3&#x000a0;% have coronary heart disease, 1.8&#x000a0;% have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 1.7&#x000a0;% have had a stroke or TIA and 1.6&#x000a0;% have atrial fibrillation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. And yet people with chronic physical health problems are almost invisible in contemporary fiction - we rarely see anyone adjusting their dose of insulin, having side-effects from their medication, or plotting the route of an outing by the proximity of available toilets.</p><p>Illness and disability can profoundly affect an individual's life opportunities and personal identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Goffman has written about how people with stigmatising conditions, including many health conditions, have to manage their &#x0201c;spoiled identity&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Sontag notes how diseases such as cancer, TB and syphilis are seen &#x0201c;as punishment&#x0201d;, betraying a character flaw, while the names of these diseases themselves have become adjectival, being used as a metaphor for evil [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Kleinman comments: &#x0201c;The trajectory of chronic illness assimilates to a life course, contributing so intimately to the development of a particular life that illness becomes inseparable from life history&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. And yet in contemporary fiction we may hear about a character's appearance, class, ethnicity, education, job, politics, sexual proclivities, taste in music and even the contents of their handbag, but the day -to -day experience of living with a health problem is rarely represented.</p><p>For the purposes of this course, one of the authors (PM) created a new genre, clinical realism. This is defined as &#x0201c;<italic>Fictional writing where health problems are systematically represented, not as a metaphor, not as a plot point, and not as the central topic of the writing, but as a part of a character's personal identity and day to -day experience</italic>&#x0201d;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The creative writing course ran at Manchester Medical School from 2010&#x02013;2013 and was offered to third year students twice a year as part of a four-week SSC in Narrative Medicine and Creative Writing. It accepted 6 to 8 students, who created and wrote about a character with a life-changing physical disorder. The students created a character with a back story including a serious health problem or caring for someone with a serious health problem. They then &#x0201c;inhabited&#x0201d; their character for four weeks, writing all their assignments in the first person. The assignments were not about their health problem, but were written in a &#x0201c;clinical realism&#x0201d; style, which, where possible, introduced some details about how they lived with their disorder into each piece of writing. They also wove details of the history of their disorder into their stories where it was relevant. The writing was mainly done as &#x0201c;homework&#x0201d;, and was discussed in a weekly workshop, where students were asked to comment separately on the creative writing and the medical realism aspects of each submission. At the end of the course, the students wrote obituaries for their characters.</p><p>The course evolved from 2010&#x02013;2013 in response to student feedback and teacher/learner experience. In 2013, the cohort on which this paper is based had workshops on narrative medicine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and transactional analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], and interviewed patients with chronic disorders and listened to their stories. They presented one group workshop on a narrative medicine topic during the course, and at the end of the SSC, they wrote an essay on an aspect of narrative medicine, which could incorporate examples of their own writing if they wished. The last cohort of creative writing students also wrote about how they had developed their characters and their reflections on the course.</p><p>The creative writing sessions were developed by PM from part of a teaching module from an MA in creative writing at Manchester Metropolitan University. To create their characters, the students initially chose two letters, which became the initials of their character&#x02019;s name. They then drew randomly from a selection of paper slips with diagnoses on - in this cohort, irritable bowel syndrome, post head injury with memory impairment, post-treatment breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis C and type 1 diabetes. They drew further slips to determine their age, sex, what sort of accommodation they lived in and who they lived with. They then chose names for their characters and completed a character creation questionnaire, which included details of their character, including details of their disorder and how it affected them, and also other aspects such as their appearance, what sort of clothes they wore, where they did their shopping, hobbies, aspirations, regrets and how they saw their future. The students were encouraged to research their characters by looking at online patient groups and blogs.</p><p>The workshop and writing exercises included dialogue, plot, genre, arc of the plot, description, unreliable narrator and microfiction exercises. As an example of the content, the genre workshop consisted of a discussion about genres, a short film parodying different genres, an exercise where the students wrote &#x0201c;consequences&#x0201d; type stories, each taking it in turn to write five minute segments of a &#x0201c;genre&#x0201d; story about each of their characters, and a homework genre exercise based on a conflict to do with eating lunch in a busy caf&#x000e9;.</p><p>There were some interactions with the narrative medicine seminars, for example the discussions of plot and genre in creative writing were followed by discussions and excises on plot and genre in narrative medicine.</p><p>As this report does not include real patient details and the module was approved by Manchester Medical School, no ethical approval was neccessary.</p><sec id="Sec5"><title>Theoretical approaches</title><p>This article focuses on the creative writing outputs of the cohort of six students attending the last session of the course. Additional material written by the students about their experiences of developing their characters and relevant comments from the end of module essays were also analysed with their written permission. The students were aged 21&#x02013;24, three were female and three male, and they defined themselves as four white British, one white Other and one Other. Two were post graduate students and one was an Erasmus student [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] from France, spending a year at a British medical school.</p><p>The student outputs were analysed thematically using a constructivist approach to meaning-making as a guiding principle, as developed by Charmaz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] and as used by Kristiansson et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] Constructivism asserts that reality is constructed by individuals as they assign meaning to the world around them. It aims to incorporate the multiple voices, views and visions of participants in rendering their lived experiences, and seeks to identify the patterns of behaviour in which people engage, and to understand them rather than explain them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>The outputs were analysed to see how successfully the students had been able to &#x0201c;stand in someone else's shoes.&#x0201d; In particular, evidence of representation of day- to- day experience of living with a chronic disorder and of its effects on personal and social identity were sought, and the students&#x02019; comments on the course were analysed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Approaches to creating character</title><p>The students&#x02019; approaches to creating their characters varied.

Analysis of the writing showed that the students were able to produce successful portrayals of the day- to- day experience of living with a chronic disorder. Although they were given generic topics to write about, they also introduced a number of important illness-related themes including stigma, personal identity and narrative wreckage. Not every student wrote about all of these themes, but as all of the writing was discussed in the weekly workshops, all of them discussed the themes in the context of the fictional characters.</p><p>As well as demonstrating cognitive empathy, the ability to understand how another person feels, there was also some evidence of affective empathy, experiencing he emotions that other people are feeling (&#x0201c;<italic>I found his story distressing&#x0201d;</italic>, &#x0201c;<italic>My final piece demonstrates the acceptance, respect, love and hope that has developed for Rebecca and which&#x02026;she began to feel for herself&#x0201d;).</italic> An intention to help is obviously harder to demonstrate in creative writing, but it could be argued that the students who moved their characters on from their chaos scripts were trying to help them.</p><p>A recurrent theme was that during the process of creating and then repeatedly writing about the same fictional character the students felt that they developed a deeper empathic understanding of their character, even when they initially felt little connection with them.</p><p>Gordon and Evans suggest that many students are &#x0201c;disadvantaged&#x0201d; by their material advantages when it comes to understanding other people&#x02019;s lives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It appears that in this SSC, writing repeatedly about a character they initially felt little affinity with encouraged students to feel more empathic towards their fictional characters. This is an important finding.</p><p>There has recently been interest in Longitudinal Integrated Clerkships (LICs). These are lengthy immersion placements, often in rural primary care, during which students have the opportunity to experience continuity of care and management of patients with chronic illness. They have been shown to produce more empathic students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. However, many medical courses offer mainly short rotations during which there may be limited opportunities to get to know patients well. One of the key features of LICs is the opportunity get to know and follow up patients. In a similar manner, repeatedly writing about the same character enabled the students on the SSC to get to &#x0201c;know&#x0201d; their characters. Charon suggests that health care workers need to develop &#x0201c;narrative competence&#x0201d;, the ability to &#x0201c;recognise, absorb, interpret and be moved by the stories of illness&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>] and Kleinman has argued that &#x0201c;the interpretation of narratives of illness experience is &#x0201c;a core task in the work of doctoring, although the skill has atrophied in biomedical training&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Getting to know the patient and their narrative is a necessary pre-requisite to this. The group experience of the SSC offered a safe and curated space without background &#x0201c;noise&#x0201d; within which the students could explore a patient narrative in depth, and offered the group the opportunity to learn from each other. Elizur and Rosenheim have previously demonstrated how group experience can consolidate and deepen genuine empathy, and found that the effect of this persisted at follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The &#x0201c;empathy effect&#x0201d; effect of LICs has also been shown to persist after qualification as a doctor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Shapiro and colleagues found that students trained in point-of-view writing demonstrated significantly more awareness of emotional and spiritual aspects of a paper case in and end of year writing assignment than did students trained in clinical reasoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>], while DasGupta and Charon found that a group of students who discussed their own personal illness narratives also reported an increased sense of regard and empathy for patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>].</p><p>Kumagi has written about the transformative nature of learning involving the use of narratives. He suggests that it involves learning on cognitive, affective and experiential levels, and results in a shift in non-verbalised, habitual, taken-for-granted frames of reference towards a perspective that is more open, reflective, and capable of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Gottschall, pointing to the evidence of a link between fiction reading and good social skills, comments on the role of implicit memory, the memory that is inaccessible to the conscious mind. He points out that realistic rehearsal of any skill leads to enhanced performance and that it is an axiom of neuroscience that &#x0201c;cells that fire together wire together&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>], a process that may also be applicable to rehearsal of empathy. It may not matter whether a narrative is constructed through creative writing or discovered through repeated clinical contact.</p><p>This study is based on a single module attended by six students and uses a qualitative approach to analyse whether the students were able to demonstrate empathy. The relatively small number of students involved means that the reports should be seen as a preliminary analysis, however the findings suggest that further work in this area is merited. There are challenges in considering how this should be done. Empathy is more commonly measured by self- administered questionnaire. However, as Pederson and Hemmerdinger and Stoddart have commented, there are issues of reliability and validity with most questionnaires attempting to measure empathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. A recent validation study using patient views found a correlation value of r&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.48 for one questionnaire, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>] but a further attempt to validate the same questionnaire using feedback from standardised patients raised questions about possible ethnicity and gender biases in assessments carried out by the standardised patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>As Gordon and Evan point out, medical humanities are rarely part of the mainstream curriculum in medical schools, and are generally undertaken on an opt-in basis by small groups of students, making quantitative research difficult. However, as Kumagai notes, &#x0201c;qualitative approaches yield a more in-depth, richer understanding of the meaning that individuals confer on events or life experiences&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>], while Greenhalgh notes that narrative techniques &#x0201c;provide the opportunity to generate insights that cannot be gained using the traditional tools of the quantitative researcher&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] There may be a case to further develop qualitative work in this area.</p><p>Analysis of the students&#x02019; writing showed that they demonstrated an ability to &#x0201c;stand in another&#x02019;s shoes&#x0201d; and, interestingly, the students&#x02019; comments on their own writing showed that their ability to empathise with characters they initially felt little affinity for deepened as the SSC progressed. A medical realism approach to creative writing, combined with creating and then repeatedly writing about the same fictional character, offers the potential for a low-cost intervention in a safe and convenient environment, which can potentially help to increase the empathic ability of students. As such, it merits further assessment, which may be most appropriately carried out by qualitative methods.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Ethics/consent statement</title><p>This article is based on a poster developed by PM and the other students.
