ABG is limited in quantity and its harvesting incurs an additional surgical intervention leaving the risk for associated complications and morbidities. Therefore, artificial bone graft substitutes that might replace autologous bone are needed. S53P4-type bioactive glass (BaG) is a promising material which might be used as bone graft substitute due to its osteostimulative, conductive and antimicrobial properties. In this study, we plan to examine the clinical effectiveness of BaG as a bone graft substitute in Masquelet therapy in comparison with present standard Masquelet therapy using an ABG with tricalciumphosphate to fill the bone defect.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">This randomized controlled, clinical non-inferiority trial will be carried out at the Department of Orthopedics and Traumatology at Heidelberg University. Patients who suffer from tibial or femoral non-unions with a segmental bone defect of 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;cm and who are receiving Masquelet treatment will be included in the study. The resulting bone defect will either be filled with autologous bone and tricalciumphosphate (control group, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) or BaG (S53P4) (study group, <italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;25).

In addition, this randomized trial will help to identify potential benefits and limitations regarding the use of BaG in Masquelet therapy.

Delayed or failed fracture healing can lead to enormous limitations in the quality of life due to pain, reduced mobility, and considerably longer duration of disease. In addition, non-union of a fracture can also lead to debilitating economic and social circumstances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Despite recent research advances and modern treatment options, up to 30% of long bone fractures develop non-unions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Especially the treatment of atrophic and infected non-unions, as well as large defect sizes, remains a challenge in trauma and orthopedic surgery. Treatment of segmental defects can be divided into two general categories: (1). bone transport and (2). bone filling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In defects larger than 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;cm in length the &#x0201c;gold standard&#x0201d; remains bone transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; whereas, in segmental defects of between 2- to 5-cm bone filling has shown good clinical and radiological outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Therefore, the induced membrane technique, also known as the Masquelet technique, was established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is a two-staged procedure; during the first step a vascularized membrane, containing growth factors and supporting the proliferation of human bone marrow stromal cells, is induced via a foreign-body reaction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. The second step involves surgically augmenting the membranous tube via an ABG, due to its osteostimulative and osteoconductive properties as well as its osteogenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The most frequently accessed donor site remains the iliac crest. However, complications, such as donor-site morbidity, pain and quantitative limitations, are well-documented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In recent years, the reamer/irrigator/aspirator (RIA) system has shown numerous advantages in harvesting autologous bone from the medullary canal of long bones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Reaming debris became a reliable alternative as a source for autologous bone and the RIA system has shown decreased morbidity at the harvest site and none of the complications of the iliac crest site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. From a cellular aspect, mesenchymal stem cells harvested by the RIA system show significantly superior osteogenic differentiation and higher sensitivity towards stimulation with differentiation factors compared to mesenchymal stem cells isolated from iliac crest bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">Evaluation of the outcome of non-union therapy remains challenging. A standardized approach was established by recent studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] containing both radiological and clinical parameters. Clinical outcome can be determined via assessment of mechanical stability, pain associated with weight-bearing and the subjective health of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Standard of care in the radiological assessment of bone healing and consolidation of non-union subsequent to treatment remains periodical conventional x-rays of the affected bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Radiological union can be assumed when bridging of three out of four cortices is apparent. However, evaluation of osseous consolidation of non-unions relying merely on x-rays can be misleading. In a recent study by Akiho et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] the authors compared conventional x-rays and computed tomography (CT) scans of pubic bone non-unions. Their data showed that CT scans were able to identify a larger number of delayed unions. Thus, even when osseous consolidation is presumed on x-ray, where there are numerous layers superimposed upon one another in both planes, persistent non-unions can only be detected reliably via CT scans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, utilization of CT scans is limited due to their higher radiation exposure. Therefore, a combination of both methods is beneficial to assess radiological outcome of non-union treatment. Promising new diagnostic modalities contributing to a timely identification of successful non-union treatment have been introduced in recent years. In particular, analysis of serum cytokine expression pattern was established as a valid method in the evaluation of the biological processes occurring during bone regeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In addition, dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) perfusion analysis after non-union treatment was able to successfully predict the outcome of non-union therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the combination of DCE-MRI and contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) was able to distinguish between infected and aseptic non-unions pre-operatively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Hence, a combination of standardized and innovative diagnostic modalities contributes to a precise and timely identification of successful non-union treatment and, furthermore, helps identify patients at risk for infected non-unions.</p><p id="Par17">Regardless of the source, harvesting of autologous bone necessitates an additional surgical intervention with a potential risk for associated complications and morbidities. Also, in some patients, either harvesting of autologous bone via RIA is anatomically impossible or they may have already have had both iliac crests depleted, or both may apply. Hence, alternative methods, such as allogenic bone, demineralized bone matrix and biomaterials designed as artificial bone graft substitutes, have been extensively studied, but found to be lacking in comparison to an ABG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. In order to replace the ABG, the substituting biomaterial must be bioactive (the effect of the materials on cells that activate specific responses), degradable, osteoconductive and osteostimulative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. BaG (S53P4) is such a material and is currently used as bone graft substitute and in the treatment of osteomyelitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. BaG has osteostimulative properties; the release of calcium ions leads to formation of hydroxyapatite. It is also osteoconductive, serving as a scaffold for bone formation in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. In addition, BaG has been shown to have antimicrobial properties due to its release of ions from its surface resulting in an increasing osmotic pressure and pH leading to a microenvironment unsuitable for microbial growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Therefore, S53P4-type BaG (53% SiO<sub>2</sub>, 4% P<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>, 23% Na<sub>2</sub>O and 20% CaO in wt%) is a promising material to employ as bone graft substitute in context with non-union therapy.</p><p id="Par18">The current study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) regarding the non-inferiority of the effectiveness and safety of the use of BaG (S53P4) as bone graft substitute in Masquelet therapy for treating large-sized-defect non-unions of the tibia and femur in comparison to the standard therapy. The study protocol for the RCT is described in the present manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par19">The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of the clinical effectiveness of BaG as a bone graft substitute in Masquelet therapy when compared to present standard Masquelet therapy using an ABG in combination with ceramic bone substitutes, such as tricalciumphosphates, to fill the bone defect. Secondary objectives include subjective patient quality of life directly post-operative as well as during the time of recovery, documentation of perfusion of the bone graft using CEUS as well as DCE-MRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Furthermore, patient data (such as smoking status, drug abuse, profession, time necessary to return to work and pre-existing condition) will be assessed and evaluated. Therefore, the results from the current study will facilitate the evaluation of BaG as a bone graft substitute regarding objective parameters associated with consolidation as well as subjective parameters associated with the patients&#x02019; quality of life. Furthermore, patients who are at risk for unsuccessful treatment with one or the other approach might be identified. Hence, results from the study will contribute to thoroughly assess whether BaG is a suitable bone graft substitute in non-union therapy using the Masquelet method.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study design</title><p id="Par20">This is a registered, prospective, single-center, two-arm, parallel-group, randomized controlled non-inferiority trial (DRKS00013882).</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p id="Par21">Patients older than 18&#x000a0;years who suffer from tibial or femoral non-unions with a segmental bone defect of 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;cm and who are receiving Masquelet treatment will be included into the study after giving informed consent.

This method helps in maintaining the balance of treatment assignment while reducing the potential for selection bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Randomization is performed by an employee not involved in treatment, assessment or data collection regarding the present study using opaque, sealed envelopes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Surgical treatment</title><p id="Par24">After information and randomization, all patients receive contrast-enhanced ultrasound sonography (CEUS) pre-operatively to evaluate local perfusion. Hereafter, they are scheduled for Masquelet therapy of the non-union. Masquelet therapy is based on the principles of the &#x0201c;diamond concept&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and is a two-step procedure (step I and step II). During the first step, radical debridement of the non-union, non-viable bone and surrounding tissue is performed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. The resulting segmental bone defect is subsequently filled with polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA), which induces a foreign-body reaction, resulting in a vascularized Masquelet membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. In addition, multiple bone and soft tissue samples are harvested for microbiological examination. The first step is repeated until all samples are sterile. Once sterile, the spacer is left in situ for 6&#x000a0;weeks to guarantee a fully grown Masquelet membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In a second step the spacer is removed while leaving the membrane unimpaired and the resulting bone defect filled with either autologous bone and tricalcium phosphate (control group) or BaG (S53P4) (study group). Due to the decreased morbidity at the harvest site and significantly superior osteogenic differentiation and higher sensitivity towards stimulation with differentiation factors harvesting of autologous bone graft will be performed with the RIA system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. However, if the quantity of the reaming material threatens to be insufficient, additional harvesting of the iliac crest might be necessary to achieve sufficient filling of the osseous defect. De novo osteosynthesis utilizing plates, nails or external fixators is performed depending on the biomechanical stability during the first or second step of the Masquelet therapy. The eligibility of the utilized method of osteosynthesis will be based on anatomical premises as well as morphology of the non-union and will be carefully evaluated pre-operatively. A flow chart of the surgical treatment is depicted in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. Post-operatively, all patients regardless of the method of fixation will be treated with partial weight-bearing of 20&#x000a0;kg for 6&#x000a0;weeks; afterwards patients will gradually increase weight-bearing with approximately 10&#x000a0;kg per week until full weight-bearing is achieved.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart of the Masquelet therapy and treatment pattern of included patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2681_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Follow-up</title><p id="Par25">Subsequent to the operative therapy, all patients will receive the same follow-up procedures. Follow-up at our institution is standardized and all procedures and diagnostics are based solely on medical indications. Initial radiological and clinical evaluation of the surgical treatment will be performed on day 2 after surgery. Discharge from the hospital will be realized as soon as soft tissue conditions, patient mobility and pain level allow it. Afterwards, patients will receive physiotherapy on a regular basis of at least twice a week.

In particular, after implantation a surface reaction occurs, resulting in formation of a calcium phosphate layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">47</xref>]. Release of various ions increases local pH and osmotic pressure, then a silica gel layer is formed on the surface of the biomaterial and amorphous calcium phosphate precipitates on this layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Thereafter, crystallization to natural hydroxyapatite occurs, which starts the activation of osteoblasts and initiates the formation of new bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. During this process, new bone is constituted, the BaG absorbed and the antibacterial microenvironment maintained due to a persistently increased pH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Hence, BaG as an artificial bone substitute might contribute to successful non-union treatment by both osteostimulative bone regeneration and prevention of an infection via its antimicrobial properties. Furthermore, implantation of BaG prevents the surgical intervention necessary for harvesting of the ABG and, therefore, might contribute to a lower complication rate and lower comorbidities associated with Masquelet therapy. A potential limitation of the planned study lies in the utilization of different methods of osteosynthesis that might influence the outcome of non-union treatment. However, a study by Vallier et al. compared the results between plate fixation and intramedullary nail fixation of tibial shaft fractures. The authors concluded that rates of union, infection and secondary procedures were similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. In addition, all included patients will employ the same post-operative weight-bearing pattern. Therefore, we believe that the influence of different methods of osteosynthesis on the findings of the planned study to be minimal. The results from the current study will help evaluate the clinical effectiveness of this promising biomaterial in non-union therapy. Our hypothesis is that S53P4-type BaG will have the same rate of consolidation as autologous bone when used in the second step of the Masquelet therapy. Furthermore, we assume that the rate of perioperative infection in patients treated with S53P4-BaG will be reduced compared to the control group and that patients of the study group will have fewer post-operative complications and morbidities. The results of the study should, therefore, help investigate the potential benefits and limitations regarding the use of S53P4-BaG in Masquelet therapy. Data from the study will increase the knowledge about S53P4-BaG as a bone graft substitute as well as identify patients who might benefit from Masquelet therapy using this type of BaG and those who are more likely to fail. Ultimately, the current study might contribute to an improvement in the quality of non-union treatment.</p><sec id="Sec16"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par34">The RCT recruitment and surgical treatment are planned from April 2018 until April 2020.
