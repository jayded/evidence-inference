Participants had heart rate (HR), blood pressure, resting energy expenditure (REE), 12-lead electrocardiograms (ECG), perceptions about readiness to perform, cognitive function (Stroop Color-Word test), bench and leg press performance (2 sets of 10 repetitions at 70% of 1RM and 1 set to failure), and Wingate anaerobic capacity (WAC) sprint performance determined as well as donated blood samples prior to and/or following exercise/supplementation. Data were analyzed by MANOVA with repeated measures as well as mean changes from baseline with 95% confidence intervals (CI).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>No clinically significant differences were observed among treatments in HR, blood pressure, ECG, or general clinical blood panels. There was evidence that PWS and PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S ingestion promoted greater changes in REE responses. Participants reported higher perception of optimism about performance and vigor and energy with PWS and PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S ingestion and there was evidence that PWS and PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S improved changes in cognitive function scores from baseline to a greater degree than PLA after 1 or 2&#x000a0;h. However, the scores in the PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S treatment did not exceed PLA or PWS responses at any data point.

For this reason, a number of energy drinks and pre-workout supplements (PWS) have been developed and marketed to active individuals. The primary ergogenic properties in most of these supplements appears to be water, carbohydrate, and caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. However, more recently PWS&#x02019;s have been developed that not only contain nutrients that may affect acute exercise performance (e.g., carbohydrate, caffeine, nitrates, etc.) but also nutrients that can increase energy expenditure, reduce catabolism, and/or promote protein synthesis (e.g., amino acids, creatine, &#x003b2;-alanine, etc.) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Theoretically, use of PWS&#x02019;s prior to exercise may enhance mental focus, cognitive function, and/or exercise capacity and regular use of PWS&#x02019;s during training may lead to greater training adaptations. Consequently, there has been increased interest in examining the acute and chronic safety and efficacy of PWS&#x02019;s marketed to active individuals as well as whether adding potentially ergogenic nutrients to PWS&#x02019;s may promote additive benefits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>This study examined the safety and efficacy of acute ingestion of a market leading PWS on ratings of perception of readiness to perform, resting energy expenditure and metabolism, cognitive function, exercise performance, and markers of safety. The PWS studied contained several nutrients at previously reported effective doses that have ergogenic properties including caffeine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], beta-alanine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], nitrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], arginine alpha-ketoglutarate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] as well as other nutrients purported to effect cognitive function like tyrosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] and <italic>Mucuna pruriens</italic> containing L-Dopa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. It is well established that consuming caffeine prior to exercise (e.g., 3&#x02013;6&#x000a0;mg/kg) can improve exercise performance, cognitive function, and vigilance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. A number of studies also indicate that ingestion of nitrate prior to exercise (e.g., 300&#x000a0;mg) can improve exercise capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Theoretically, ingesting these nutrients at effective doses in PWS&#x02019;s prior to exercise may improve perceptions of readiness to perform, cognitive function, and/or exercise performance leading to higher quality workouts. If so, regular use of these types of PWS may effect quality of training and/or training adaptations particularly if they contain nutrients that have been reported to enhance training adaptations like beta-alanine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] and/or creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>

</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Discussion</title><p>The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of acute ingestion of a PWS with and without <italic>p</italic>-synephrine on resting energy expenditure, perceptions of readiness to perform, cognitive function, and anaerobic exercise performance. Additionally, to examine the safety of acute ingestion of these PWS&#x02019;s on resting heart rate, blood pressure, 12-lead ECG tracings, and standard clinical blood chemistry panels. Results revealed that ingestion of these PWS&#x02019;s did not promote clinically significant changes in heart rate, blood pressure, ECG findings, or clinical blood markers. Thus, acute ingestion of these PWS&#x02019;s prior to exercise appeared to be well-tolerated when consumed by young, healthy individuals. The primary effect of ingesting these PWS&#x02019;s prior to exercise appeared to be an increase resting energy expenditure, improved perceptions about readiness to perform, and improved cognitive function. There were limited to no effects on bench press and leg press muscular endurance as well as anaerobic sprint capacity. Moreover, adding 20&#x000a0;mg of <italic>p</italic>-synephrine to the PWS provided little to no additive benefits. The following sections provide a more detailed analysis of results observed and comparison to available literature.</p><sec id="Sec25"><title>Resting energy expenditure</title><p>A number of studies have reported that ingestion of energy drinks and/or thermogenic type supplements primarily containing caffeine can increase resting metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>]. For example, Taylor and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">65</xref>] reported that ingestion of caffeine enriched coffee (400&#x000a0;mg) increased REE by approximately 14% for up to 3-h compared to consumption of coffee containing standard amounts of caffeine (200&#x000a0;mg). Rudelle and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>] reported that consuming beverages containing green tea catechins, caffeine, and calcium for 3-days increased energy expenditure by 106&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;31&#x000a0;kcal/24&#x000a0;h. Ryan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>] reported that ingestion of a thermogenic supplement containing caffeine, capsaicin, bioperine, and niacin increased energy expenditure and oxygen update values. Wilborn and associates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] reported that ingestion of a thermogenic supplement containing green tea extract and caffeine increased REE by 15-19% compared to 0.3&#x02013;2.5% when ingesting a placebo. Campbell and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">60</xref>] reported that ingestion of a supplement containing 200&#x000a0;mg of caffeine and green tea extract significantly increased resting metabolic rate from 7 to 9% for up to 3&#x000a0;h after ingestion. Moreover, Miles-Chan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] reported that consumption of a sugar free energy drink containing 120&#x000a0;mg of caffeine increased REE by about 4% and that the changes observed were due to the caffeine in the drinks rather than other nutrients (i.e., taurine and glucuronolactone).</p><p>
<italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> (generally containing 20&#x02013;100&#x000a0;mg of <italic>p</italic>-synephrine) has also been purported to increase resting energy expenditure and/or effect carbohydrate and fat oxidation rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. For example, Ratamass and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>] reported that ingestion of 100&#x000a0;mg of <italic>p</italic>-synephrine increased lipolysis primarily at rest as well as post-exercise oxygen uptake, energy expenditure, and fat oxidation. Sale et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] reported that ingesting a supplement containing 6&#x000a0;mg of <italic>p-</italic>synephrine, 150&#x000a0;mg caffeine, and 150&#x000a0;mg catechin polyphenols increased resting and exercise carbohydrate oxidation rates. Additionally, Guti&#x000e9;rrz-Hell&#x000ed;n and Del Coso [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] reported that acute <italic>p</italic>-synephrine ingestion (3&#x000a0;mg/kg) increased fat oxidation rates while exercising at low-to-moderate exercise intensities. Thus, there is support to the rationale that adding <italic>p</italic>-synephrine to a PWS can increase metabolism and affect substrate utilization.</p><p>Results of the present study provide some support to this contention. In this regard, mean oxygen uptake during the 30&#x000a0;min REE test was increased by about 1.4% in the PLA treatment compared to 5.6% in the PWS treatment and 8.6% in the PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S treatment. There was also evidence that PWS and PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S ingestion significantly increased resting VCO<sub>2</sub> and RER to a greater degree than in the PLA treatment indicating greater carbohydrate oxidation. Analysis of AUC changes from baseline indicated that while PWS had a greater impact on VO<sub>2</sub> VCO<sub>2</sub> and RER values; the PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S observed greater changes from baseline compared to the PLA treatment. These findings are consistent with several reports indicating that ingestion of thermogenic type supplements increases energy metabolism and/or carbohydrate oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>] while contrasting other studies reporting either no effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>] or greater fat oxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. However, ingestion of PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S treatment did not result in higher mean VO<sub>2</sub> values than the PWS treatment. Therefore, the addition of <italic>p</italic>-synephrine to the PWS did not promote greater overall energy expenditure. Whether adding higher levels of <italic>p-</italic>synephrine would promote added benefits remains to be determined.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Perceptions of readiness to perform and cognitive function</title><p>Numerous studies indicate that ingesting caffeine containing energy drinks or supplements can improve mental focus and/or cognition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>]. There is also evidence that <italic>Citrus aurantium</italic> ingestion can affect memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Therefore, it&#x02019;s plausible that ingestion of a PWS containing caffeine and/or <italic>p</italic>-synephrine could affect mental focus and/or cognitive function prior to and/or during exercise. In the present study, participants ingesting the PWS&#x02019;s indicated they felt more optimistic about performance and more vigorous and energetic after ingestion the PWS&#x02019;s compared to the PLA treatment. Additionally, there was evidence that ingestion of the PWS and PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S consistently increased Word, Color, and Word-Color scores from baseline and that some of these changes were greater than PLA responses after 1 or 2&#x000a0;h. However, it should be noted that participants started the PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S treatment with lower scores prior to supplementation and the scores in the PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S treatment did not exceed PLA or PWS responses at any data point so these results should be interpreted with caution. Further, the addition of 20&#x000a0;mg of <italic>p</italic>-synephrine to the PWS supplement used in our study did not appear to provide additive benefit. Results are in agreement with Hoffman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>] who reported a significantly greater feeling of energy and focus compared to placebo after ingesting a supplement containing a PWS but contrast those of Gonzales and associates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] who reported no significant difference in VAS ratings of energy when ingesting a supplement containing caffeine, creatine, &#x003b2;-alanine. However, the participants in that study were administered the supplement 10-min before performing resistance-exercise which may have limited results since it takes about an hour for caffeine levels in the blood to peak after caffeine ingestion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Exercise performance</title><p>Numerous studies have evaluated the effects of ingesting PWS&#x02019;s and/or energy drinks containing a variety of nutrients on exercise performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. For example, Walsh and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">70</xref>] reported that ingestion of a PWS containing 2.05&#x000a0;g of an energy matrix (caffeine, taurine, glucuronolactone) with amino acids significantly improved perceptions of energy, decreased perceptions of fatigue, an improved run time to exhaustion at 70% of VCO<sub>2</sub> max. Gonzalez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>] reported that acute ingestion of a pre-workout supplement containing caffeine, &#x003b2;-alanine, and creatine significantly increased the number of repetitions performed at 80% of 1RM as well as peak and mean power of bench press. Additionally, Ratamess et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>] reported that acute supplementation of PWS&#x02019;s containing <italic>p</italic>-synephrine (100&#x000a0;mg), p-synephrine (100&#x000a0;mg) and caffeine (100&#x000a0;mg) increased the number of repetitions and lifting volume (6 sets of squats for up to 10 repetitions at 80% 1RM) compared to control and placebo treatments. Differences were more noted in the final 3 sets of exercise. Further, mean power and lifting velocity was reported to be higher for the caffeine and <italic>p</italic>-synephrine treatment compared to control and placebo treatments. Consequently, there is evidence that ingestion of caffeine and/or p-synephrine prior to exercise may affect high intensity exercise performance.</p><p>In the present study, no clear ergogenic benefit of PWS or PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S ingestion was observed. While participants in the PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S treatment tended to perform more total work during the final set of bench press, no overall differences were observed in bench press or leg press lifting volume. Additionally, no differences were observed among treatments in the Wingate Anaerobic Capacity cycling sprint test. Therefore, while participants reported they had more energy and were more optimistic about performance, it did not result in statistically significant differences in upper and lower body muscular endurance or sprint capacity. Whether adding more <italic>p</italic>-synephrine to the PWS or regular use of these PWS&#x02019;s during training may yield more definitive ergogenic benefit remains to be unclear.</p></sec><sec id="Sec28"><title>Safety</title><p>One of the criticisms of use of energy drinks and/or PWS&#x02019;s containing caffeine and/or <italic>p</italic>-synephrine is that they may increase heart, blood pressure, and/or prevalence of arrhythmias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">74</xref>]. In the present study, acute ingestion of PWS or PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S did not significantly increased heart rate, blood pressure, or effect resting ECG&#x02019;s. Additionally, although there were some expected changes in blood markers in response to exercise (hemoconcentration) and/or ingestion of maltodextrin, creatine, and caffeine containing PWS&#x02019;s (i.e., evidence of increased creatinine, lipolysis, and blood glucose release); values remained within normal expected values for trained individuals undergoing intense exercise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>] as well as within normal clinical ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. In this regard, creatinine levels expectedly increased to a greater degree in the PWS and PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S but these values were small and well-within normal ranges for active individuals particularly when taking creatine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">53</xref>]. Moreover, while significant interactions were observed among treatments in BUN and the ratio of BUN: Creatinine, all values decreased suggesting less general whole body catabolism. Additionally, while significant differences were seen in total cholesterol among treatments, total cholesterol did not significantly change from baseline in any treatment and the CHOL: HDL-c ratio either was unchanged or decreased suggesting reduced risk. Finally, while differences were observed among treatments in pre- and post-exercise/supplementation blood glucose values and blood glucose was higher with PWS ingestion suggesting greater hepatic glucose release (which would be beneficial during exercise); no significant differences were observed between PWS and PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S treatments and all treatments and were within normal expected exercise ranges [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. We also did not observe any adverse events related to the study that required medical treatment or clinical findings that required medical referral. Consequently, ingestion of these PWS&#x02019;s prior to exercise did not appear to promote any clinically relevant changes in these markers. These findings support prior reports that ingestion of PWS&#x02019;s and/or energy drinks do not appear to pose undo health risk in apparently healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">59</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Within the limits of the present study, acute ingestion of PWS and/or PWS&#x02009;+&#x02009;S prior to exercise appears to be well-tolerated when consumed by young, healthy individuals. The primary effects appear to be to increase resting energy expenditure responses and improve perceptions about readiness to perform and cognitive function with limited to no effects on muscular endurance and no effects on anaerobic sprint capacity. The addition of 20&#x000a0;mg of <italic>p</italic>-synephrine to the PWS yielded limited to no additive benefits. Whether regular use of the PWS&#x02019;s used in this study and/or higher amounts of <italic>p</italic>-synephrine may promote greater benefits remains to be determined. Given the widespread use of PWS&#x02019;s and energy drinks, additional study to examine the safety and efficacy is warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank the subjects that participated in this study as well as Abigail O&#x02019;Connor, Chelsea Goodenough, Felix Ayadi, Chun-Hao Chang, Jeremy Carter, and Sunday Simbo at the Exercise &#x00026; Sport Nutrition Laboratory at Texas A&#x00026;M University who assisted with data collection.
