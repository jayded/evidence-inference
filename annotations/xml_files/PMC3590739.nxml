Ramaiah Dental College Bangalore, with age ranging between 18-40 years. They were divided into two groups with 15 patients in each healthy (control) and periodontitis (experimental) groups, respectively. Healthy group: 15 subjects with healthy periodontal conditions. Periodontitis group: 15 subjects with clinically diagnosed periodontitis having presence of at least 2 non-adjacent sites per quadrant with probing pocket depths &#x02265;5 mm which bled upon gentle probing and patients who had not undergone any periodontal treatment for at least 6 months prior to sampling were included in the study.

Next, NBT, the final concentration of which ranged to 1&#x000d7;10<sup>-4</sup>, was added to the blood in the test tubes, which were kept for 20 min at the temperature of 37&#x000b0;C. On completion of incubation, the tubes were centrifuged for 5 min at 2000 rpm to sediment any cells.

Neutrophils are the predominant inflammatory cells in gingival tissues. Sites with periodontitis are associated with increased levels of a variety of cytokines and chemokines produced by inflammatory cells and normal resident cell population with in periodontal tissues. A variety of pro inflammatory cytokines [TNF ALPLA, IL-8, IL-1, IL-&#x0200a;6], growth factors, and lipopolysaccharides have a priming effect on human neutrophil oxidative burst. ROS generation in periodontal disease causes bone resorption, degrade connective tissue, increases matrix metalloproteinases activity causing an imbalance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Traditionally, ROS production by phagocytes has been associated with the defense of body to infection as they are essential for efficient killing of microbes. By contrast, ROS generation at high levels can cause oxidative stress within tissues and result in direct damage to cells and extracellular matrix. Products of this oxidative damage such as advanced glycation end products and lipid peroxide proteins can lead to further ROS induced damage by their priming and chemotactic effect on neutrophils.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>Currently, there are no gold standard methods for measuring antioxidant capacity or ROS-mediated tissue damage in humans. All the systems utilize different measurement indices and the specificity of the biomarkers employed dictate the measurement obtained, which differs between assays and between different biological samples and their components.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] Free radicals and other reactive species have extremely short half-lives <italic>in vivo</italic> (10<sup>-6</sup>-10<sup>-9</sup>s) and simply cannot be measured directly. The majorities of clinical studies employ biomarkers of oxidative stress or tissue damage to vital macromolecules, rather than spin traps.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>]</p><p>The main sources of biomarkers of ROS activity are lipid peroxidation, protein/amino acid oxidation, carbohydrate damage, and DNA damage. All the assays for these biomarkers are intricate[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] suggesting a rather simple method for assessment of whole blood TAOC &#x02013; the reduction of nitroblue tetrazolium test. Our study using this test has shown that whole blood TAOC in patients with periodontitis was significantly lower (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.005) than in the healthy controls.</p><p>In medicobiological literature, only one study was assigned for whole blood TAOC in periodontitis patients which showed total antioxidant capacity significantly lower in periodontitis patients.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] In the current study, we have also found significantly lowered whole blood TAOC in periodontitis patients when compared with periodontally healthy subjects, which is in accordance with the previous study.</p><p>All the published studies have suggested that patients with chronic periodontitis have higher levels of lipid peroxidation than periodontally healthy control.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>]</p><p>Only three studies were assigned for total antioxidant capacity of serum/plasma taken from periodontitis patients showed a significantly lower total antioxidant capacity of the serum and plasma samples taken from the periodontitis subjects found that the reduced serum total antioxidant capacity in periodontitis did not completely reach significance.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Guarnieri <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated spontaneous generation of superoxide in the gingival crevicular fluid of periodontitis subjects, but found no differences in antioxidant scavenging capacity between cases and controls.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>Brock <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a significantly lower total antioxidant capacity in periodontitis subjects relative to age- and sex-matched controls. Gingival crevicular fluid total antioxidant capacity was significantly greater than in paired serum and plasma samples in healthy subjects, but this difference was not seen in periodontitis subjects.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><p>Data on salivary total antioxidant capacity are conflicting.

Finally, the reduced total blood antioxidant status in periodontitis subjects warrants further investigation as it may provide a mechanistic link between periodontal disease and several other free
