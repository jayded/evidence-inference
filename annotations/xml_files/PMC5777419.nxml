The prevalence of this disease is close to 90% worldwide. In Chile, the destruction of periodontal tissues affects the majority of the adult population. The loss of clinical attachment higher than 3 mm in at least one site was of 93.4% for the population aging 35-44 years and of 97.5% for the group aging 65-74 years. When the severity of clinical attachment loss increased to 5 mm or more in at least one site, the percentage of the population affected was 58.3% and 81.4%, respectively<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>6</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>The etiology of this disease has been considered as polymicrobial, in which specific bacteria in the community have been associated with the development of the disease after the host defense response to the noxa. Evidence shows that the total bacterial load varies in healthy sites when compared with unhealthy sites<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>1</sup>
</xref>. Members of the red complex, such as <italic>Porphyromonas gingivalis</italic> and <italic>Tannerella forsythia</italic> described by Socransky, et al<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>(1998), are considered as the most pathogenic microbial components at present. The bacteria of the red complex present a similar prevalence in patients with different forms of periodontitis<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>23</sup>
</xref>. Likewise, <italic>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</italic> is associated with periodontal disease, but it does not belong to the red complex.</p><p>In Chile, the prevalence of <italic>P. gingivalis, A. actinomycetemcomitans</italic> and <italic>T. forsythia</italic> in adults with chronic periodontitis was higher than 75%, 20% and 15% respectively<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>5</sup>
</xref>. In this context, periodontal therapy is focused on the control of the associated microbiota, removing or reducing the bacterial load of the periodontopathogens associated with the subgingival biofilm. The gold standard in periodontal treatment is formed by scaling and root planing<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>4</sup>
</xref>. Systemic antibiotic therapy is indicated to control deep periodontal pockets, difficult to access and with microbial invasion at epithelial level, with tissue destruction and disease progressing over time. The recolonization of other oral sites by periodontopathogens accounts for the failure of conventional therapy. Nevertheless, in Chile, there are no studies providing information about the response of the native microbiota to the systemic use of antibiotics. Therefore, it is important to consider the microbial resistance observed for the use of these antibacterial agents<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>17</sup>
</xref>.</p><p>Given the background in the literature, the selection of bacterial species resistant to the antibacterial treatment has been considered a global problem after the excessive use of these drugs. This leads to the search for new tools for the control of infectious diseases<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>8</sup>
</xref>. The use of probiotics has become more common in recent years. They are food supplements with microbial elements that have a physiologic effect on the organism that receives them. The effect of the use of probiotics in the treatment of chronic periodontitis had been studied<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">

It is a double-blind, placebo-controlled and parallel-arm randomized clinical trial and it was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013. This clinical trial was approved by the local Research Ethics Committee of the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile (Decision no.: 2012/ 08). The protocol of the study was explained to all patients, who signed an informed consent form after explanation of the purpose, nature, risks and benefits of participating in this study (identification no.

Ninety-six volunteers were initially examined, of which we included 47 in this study. Inclusion criteria were: healthy, non- institutionalized male or female subjects, at least 35 years of age, presence of a minimum of 14 natural teeth, excluding third molars, presence of at least 10 posterior teeth, previously untreated for periodontitis. Exclusion criteria were: suffering any systemic illness, pregnant and breastfeeding women, having received any periodontal treatment before the time of examination, having received antibiotics or non-steroid anti-inflammatory therapy in the 6-month period prior to the study. Chronic periodontitis was determined as follows: presence of at least five teeth with periodontal sites with pocket probing depth (PPD) &#x02265; 4mm and clinical attachment loss (CAL) &#x02265;1 mm, 20% bleeding on probing (BOP) and extensive radiographically determined bone loss<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">

According to the calculation, 14 patients were needed in each group to provide 80% power with an a of 0.05.</p><p>After baseline examinations, all patients were given proper oral hygiene instructions, using standardized manual toothbrush. Scaling and root planing per quadrant was performed with one-week intervals in 4-6 sessions (by Paola Carvajal and Claudia Godoy). SRP was performed using an ultrasonic scaler (Cavitron, Dentsply, York, PA, U.S.A) and hand instruments (Hu Friedy Mfg. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.). The study coordinator (Jorge Gamonal) randomized the participants over the three treatment groups: placebo (SRP + placebo), probiotic (SRP + probiotic) or antibiotic (SRP + antibiotic) group. According to gender, age, and smoking status, eligible individuals were randomly allocated to groups after the basal examination, using a computer-generated randomization table (Jorge Gamonal). Allocation concealment was prepared using sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes. The probiotic group patients received <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> SP1 [(2&#x000d7;10<sup>7</sup>colony forming units (CFU)/ day)] (Macrofood S.A., Santiago de Chile, Chile) for 3 months. The dose was one sachet taken orally daily. The sachets presented to the patients were identical. Individuals were instructed to dissolve 1 sachet in water (150 mL) and ingest it once a day after brushing their teeth. Also, probiotic group patients received placebo with identical taste and appearance than antibiotic capsules. The antibiotic group patients took azithromycin 500 mg q.d, for 5 days and a probiotic placebo with identical taste, texture and appearance to the probiotic sachet. Placebo group patients received placebo from the manufacturer of identical taste, texture, and appearance to the probiotic sachet and antibiotic capsule. The patients started taking the probiotic, antibiotic or placebo after the last session of SRP. Every 3 months, they received periodontal supportive therapy (by Paola Carvajal and Claudia Godoy), with monitoring of individual compliance, medical history and diet throughout the study period. Patients, examiner and dentists who performed periodontal treatment were blinded to the study group assignment except for the study coordinator (Jorge Gamonal). The designation of the different groups was only revealed after study completion.</p><p>The study coordinator handed out the study materials.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical examination</title><p>Periodontal clinical examination consisted of full-mouth PPD, dichotomous measurements of supragingival plaque accumulation, and BOP at the base of the crevice, measured at six sites per tooth. CAL was determined using the distance from the cement-enamel junction (CEJ) to the free gingival margin (FGM) and the distance from the FGM to the bottom of the pocket/sulcus. All examinations were performed using a first generation manual periodontal probe (UNC-15, Hu Friedy Mfg. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A.) by one calibrated examiner (Alicia Morales) (intra-class correlation coefficient of 0.80 for CAL).</p><p>Clinical examination was recorded at baseline 3, 6 and 9 months after therapy.</p></sec><sec><title>Subgingival plaque samples</title><p>Subgingival plaque samples were collected from four periodontal sites with clinical attachment level &#x02265; 1mm, probing pocket depth &#x02265; 4mm and bleeding on probing, one site in each quadrant. After isolating the area with cotton rolls and gently air-drying it, supragingival deposits were carefully removed with curettes (Hu Friedy Mfg. Co. Inc., Chicago, IL, U.S.A). Two standardized no. 30 sterile paper points (Johnson &#x00026; Johnson, Tokyo, Japan) were inserted into the deepest part of the periodontal pocket for 20 seconds in order to obtain subgingival microbial samples. Each sample was deposited in a vial containing 1 ml of cold sterilized pre-reduced transport fluid (RTF) without EDTA. Vials with samples were transported at 4&#x000b0;C to the Microbiological Laboratory of the Faculty of Dentistry, University of Chile, and processed immediately.</p><p>Subgingival samples were collected at baseline 3, 6 and 9 months after therapy by one examiner (Jorge Gamonal).</p></sec><sec><title>Microbiological procedures</title><p>Microbiological procedures were performed by one expert (Nora Silva).</p><p>Subgingival plaque samples were dispersed by mixing for 45 seconds followed by a 10-fold serial dilution of the bacterial suspension in RTF, using PBS.</p><p>Procedures to detect and quantify <italic>P. gingivalis</italic> and <italic>T. forsythia</italic> were: Aliquots of 100 &#x003bc;L of the appropriate dilution (10<sup>-2</sup> and 10<sup>-3</sup>) were plated on nonselective blood- agar, hemin- menadione medium.

</xref>.</p><p>The selection of the "best" probiotic for oral health is still a controversial topic. In addition to this, evidence coming from gastroenterology has started a change in the concept of probiotics. The treatment with antibiotic destroys the bacterial populations forming the commensal microbiota, which generates a dysbiosis, increasing the susceptibility to a wide range of other bacterial infections, as it reduces the resistance to colonization. Specifically, the destruction of obligate anaerobes coming from the lower gastrointestinal tract results in the expansion of oxygen-tolerant bacteria such as &#x003b3;-proteobacteria and <italic>Enterococcus spp.</italic> This bacterium has been identified in oral diseases, including chronic periodontitis, and presents, among others, virulence factors associated with resistance to antibacterial treatments, becoming a reservoir of transferable elements that would favor the genetic variability associated with microbial resistance<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>24</sup>
</xref>. Hence, it has been proposed that the development of commensal bacteria as probiotics is a high priority for preventive and therapeutic purposes<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">
