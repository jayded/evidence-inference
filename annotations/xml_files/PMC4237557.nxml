This sub-study compared metabolism and metabolite pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of investigational new insulin glargine U300 (Gla-300) with insulin glargine 100 U/ml (Gla-100, Lantus&#x000ae;, Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) in people with type 1 diabetes. Participants received 0.4 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18) or 0.6 U/kg Gla-300 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;12), and 0.4 U/kg Gla-100 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) once daily in randomized order for 8 days prior to a 36-h euglycaemic clamp. Metabolites were quantified using immunoaffinity enrichment and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Glargine metabolism was the same regardless of Gla-100 or Gla-300 administration; M1 was confirmed as the principal active moiety circulating in blood. Steady state concentrations of M1 were achieved after 2 days for Gla-100, and 4 days for Gla-300.

Despite improvements in diabetes management, glycaemic control remains suboptimal in many people. A treatment to achieve tighter glycaemic control, and overcome the barriers to insulin initiation and intensification, while providing activity beyond 24&#x02009;h, is required. A basal insulin supply with a further reduced peak-to-trough ratio, conferring a prolonged duration of action, could help to achieve this; investigational new insulin glargine U300 (Gla-300), comprising 300 U/ml insulin glargine, delivers insulin glargine at a reduced rate from the SC precipitate, resulting in even flatter and prolonged pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD) profiles with longer tight glycaemic control beyond 24&#x02009;h compared with Gla-100 <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>Insulin glargine (M0; 21<sup>A</sup>-Gly-31<sup>B</sup>-Arg-32<sup>B</sup>-Arg-human insulin) is a 21<sup>A</sup>-Gly-modified mimic of 31<sup>B</sup>-Arg-32<sup>B</sup>-Arg-insulin, a final intermediate of natural human insulin (Figure S1) <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>.

Subsequent loss of threonine at position 30<sup>B</sup> yields 21<sup>A</sup>-Gly-des-30<sup>B</sup>-Thr-human insulin (M2) <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.

This study demonstrates that 21<sup>A</sup>-Gly-human insulin (M1) is the principal active moiety circulating in blood for both Gla-100 and Gla-300, suggesting that the metabolic effect of both is driven by M1. Steady state PK profiles of M1 after Gla-300 administration are even flatter and prolonged compared with Gla-100, in line with results from total glargine unspecific RIA measurements. Although M1 has equal glucose-lowering potency compared with parent glargine (M0) <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <italic>in vitro</italic> studies demonstrate that, in contrast to M0, M1 does not exhibit an increased affinity for IGF-1R or increased mitogenicity compared with endogenous human insulin <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. These <italic>in vitro</italic> data support clinical evidence from large cohort studies <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, in which no association between long-term treatment with Gla-100 and cancer risk was demonstrated.</p><p>In conclusion, insulin glargine metabolism in humans is the same for Gla-100 and Gla-300. In both cases 21<sup>A</sup>-Gly-human insulin (M1) is the main circulating active moiety in the blood. As this metabolite has affinity for the IGF-1R similar to or lower than that of endogenous human insulin, these results support the safety profile of insulin glargine administered as either Gla-100 or Gla-300.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>R.
