Approximately 50% of adults in the United States have chronic periodontitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] and similar rates have been reported in France [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>].</p><p>Diabetes is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels. It is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in both developed and developing countries. Its prevalence for all age-groups worldwide has been estimated at 2.8% in 2000 and 4.4% in 2030 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The relationship between these two affections has been largely described in the literature over the past 50 years. Epidemiological studies have consistently shown increased frequency, extent and severity of periodontitis among diabetic adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. More recently, some controlled clinical trials have also suggested that periodontal treatment could improve glycaemic control in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. We previously conducted a systematic review of the literature and found that results were conflicting across trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>This could be attributed to considerable differences in methodology and also in the sample sizes and compositions of the groups included in the studies. The study by Jones et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] was the best quality study that we assessed in the meta-analysis but the subjects enrolled in this trial were highly specific (American veterans, mainly males, smokers, with poorly controlled diabetes). Other studies showed evidence of methodological deficiencies (mainly small sample sizes). Further, the majority of clinical trials on this topic have included subjects with poorly controlled diabetes (HbA1c &#x0003e; 9%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. We argue that periodontal treatment to improve glycaemic control in diabetic patients would be more relevant among patients with moderately poor glycaemic control (HbA1c between 7.0 and 9.5%). Interventions other than periodontal treatment (e.g. adequate medical treatment) are likely to be more effective in reducing HbA1c levels in poorly controlled diabetic patients.</p><p>Our systematic review emphasized the need to conduct a well-designed randomized controlled trial in a European population, among patients with suboptimal glycated haemoglobin levels, according to clinical recommendations for the treatment of chronic periodontitis in diabetic subjects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>The DIAPERIO trial is an open-label, 13-week follow-up, randomized, controlled trial.

We will therefore test the null hypothesis that periodontal treatment does not reduce the HbA1c level in metabolically unbalanced diabetic patients suffering from periodontitis.</p><p>The secondary objectives of this study are to assess, among metabolically unbalanced diabetic patients suffering from periodontitis:</p><p>&#x02022; whether periodontal treatment could lead to a decrease in fructosamine levels,</p><p>&#x02022; whether periodontal treatment could lead to an improvement in quality of life.</p></sec><sec><title>Study participants</title><sec><title>Setting and location</title><p>Volunteers will be recruited in the Diabetology Departments of two University Hospitals of south-western France (Toulouse-Rangueil Teaching Hospital and Bordeaux-Haut-l'Eveque Teaching Hospital). Subjects will be selected in two steps: a screening visit at the Diabetology Department, and an inclusion visit at the Dental Care Department of the same University Hospital.

Patients with any of the above problems will be offered treatment in the Dental Care Department as routine patients. Inclusion will be reconsidered after remission of the condition(s).</p></sec><sec><title>Inclusion criteria (V1)</title><p>Final inclusion will be decided at the Dental Care Departments, during the inclusion visit (V1). The criteria for inclusion are:</p><p>- written informed consent,</p><p>- no change relative to pre-inclusion criteria and non-inclusion criteria since V0,</p><p>- patient with periodontitis. Periodontitis is defined by the presence of one site with periodontal probing depth (PPD) &#x02265; 4 millimetres and clinical attachment level (CAL) &#x02265; 3 millimetres on at least 4 teeth.</p><p>- patient with HbA1c level &#x02265; 7.0% and &#x02264; 9.5%. Blood samples will be taken during V1, after periodontal assessment. Thus blood will only be taken from patients with periodontitis.</p><p>Subjects fulfilling all the inclusion criteria and none of the non-inclusion criteria at V1 will be randomized and will be given a scheduled appointment at the Dental Care Department, within 10 days for the treatment group (V2), and between 21 and 31 days from V1 for the control group (V3) (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Periodontal treatment will include non-surgical scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotherapy, and oral health instructions.</p><sec><title>&#x02022; Scaling and root planing (SRP)</title><p>This will be performed at V2 for the treatment group, and at V5 for the control group (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Non-surgical periodontal therapy will be performed during a 2-hour, single-session, full-mouth ultrasonic debridement by trained dentists-examiners, who will receive special training from a periodontist prior to the beginning of the study.</p><p>Disclosing solution will be used to visualize the plaque for the clinician. Then scaling and root planing will involve removal of supra- and sub-gingival plaque from all tooth surfaces, and removal of supra- and sub-gingival calculus with both ultrasonic and hand instruments (Gracey curettes). Mechanical debridement will be performed under local anaesthesia if necessary. Scaling and root planing will be combined with subgingival irrigation using an antiseptic mouth rinse (chlorhexidine 0.12%). Finally, the coronal and radicular surfaces of the teeth will be polished.</p></sec><sec><title>&#x02022; Systemic antibiotherapy (ATB)</title><p>The French health authorities recommend the prescription of systemic antibiotherapy for metabolically unbalanced diabetic patients receiving periodontal treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. On primary intention, capsules of 500 mg amoxicillin will be prescribed to patients 3 times a day (morning, midday and evening) for 7 days. Two boxes of 12 capsules will be given to the patients after scaling and root planing (at V2 for the treatment group and at V5 for the control group). In case of contraindication to beta-lactam antibiotics, capsules of 300 mg clindamycin will be prescribed to patients twice a day (morning and evening) for 7 days. One box of 16 capsules will be given to the patients after scaling and root planing (at V2 for the treatment group and at V5 for the control group). These antibiotics are recommended by French health authorities for the treatment of chronic periodontitis in diabetic patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>&#x02022; Oral health instructions (OHI)</title><p>After periodontal treatment, subjects will receive oral health instructions from the dentist that performed the scaling and root planing. These instructions will be given at V2 and V3 for the treatment group and at V5 and V6 for the control group. A 15-minute oral session will include verbal and visual information on how to use toothbrush, floss and interspace brushes, how to clean bridges and dentures, how and why to use a plaque disclosing test and a mouthwash.</p><p>A pack containing all the dental care products necessary for 3-months of periodontal maintenance will be given to the subjects at V2 for the treatment group and V5 for the control group. It will include three 75 ml tubes of toothpaste, three soft toothbrushes, 12 single-tufted interspace brushes, and sufficient dental floss and plaque disclosing tablets for a daily use over 3 months. An antiseptic mouthwash (chlorhexidine 0.12%) will also be given for mouth washing three times a day for 10 days after the scaling and root planing session.</p><p>Finally, the pack will contain leaflets that will provide pictorial information relative to the method, the frequency and the duration of each procedure.</p><p>Subjects in the control group will receive neither periodontal treatment nor a placebo during the 3-months follow-up (from V1 to V4). They will receive the same periodontal treatment as subjects in the treatment group (non-surgical scaling and root planing, systemic antibiotherapy, two-sessions of oral health instructions and antiseptic prescription) at V5 and V6 (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Outcomes</title><sec><title>HbA1c</title><p>The primary outcome of the DIAPERIO trial will be the difference in change of HbA1c from V1 to V4 between the two groups. The HbA1c level is proportional to average blood glucose concentration over the previous 1 to 3 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Fructosamine</title><p>A secondary outcome will be the difference in change of fructosamine levels from V1 to V3 and from V1 to V4 between the two groups. Fructosamine reflects an average of blood glucose levels over a period of 2 to 3 weeks.</p></sec><sec><title>Quality of life</title><p>A pragmatic outcome will be the difference in change in the quality of life between the two groups from V1 to V4. Quality of life will be assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Study assessments</title><sec><title>Periodontal status</title><p>A full-mouth periodontal examination will be performed by trained dentists-examiners at V1 and V4 for both groups. The clinical examination will include depth of periodontal pockets (PPD in mm), level of clinical attachment (CAL in mm) and bleeding on probing (BOP: yes/no). Values will be taken for all scorable teeth at six sites per tooth (mesio-buccal, mid-buccal, disto-buccal, mesio-lingual, mid-lingual and disto-lingual). No radiographs will be taken. The result of the periodontal treatment will be assessed on the healing response in the tissues using PPD, CAL, BOP, and the amount of inflamed periodontal tissue (PISA)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Questionnaires</title><p>At V1 and at V4, subjects will complete a questionnaire designed to gauge medical, social and oral health behavioral information. The questionnaire completed at V4 will assess the evolution of oral health behavior during the 3-months follow-up. Adverse events will also be reported. Reportable adverse events will include unexpected study-related events (oral adverse events) and serious adverse events regardless of cause.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>Randomization will be blocked by centre. Subjects meeting eligibility criteria at V1 will be randomly assigned to receive periodontal treatment within 10 days (treatment group) or delayed periodontal treatment (control group) with the use of a block stratified according to clinical centre.</p></sec><sec><title>Study timelines</title><p>The DIAPERIO trial will include 4 phases: pre-inclusion, inclusion-randomization, follow-up and post-follow-up (Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>). Maximum study length per participant will be 30 weeks. No longer term follow-up is planned. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> shows the study schedule.

Subjects with missing initial or final HbA1c measurements will be excluded from the analysis. The main analysis will be a comparison between the two study groups concerning the change in the HbA1c levels from baseline to 3 months in an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, adjusted for the baseline HbA1c level and clinical centre. Residual values will be examined for an approximate normal distribution. If HbA1c values are highly skewed, a transformation or non-parametric method will be used instead [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>The data will also be analysed using the "per protocol" approach. Here the analysis will be restricted to participants who were compliant with the treatment protocol (SRP, ATB and OHI).</p><p>In addition to the primary analysis, five binary outcomes for HbA1c at 3 months (a relative decrease of &#x02265;10%, a three-month level of &#x0003c; 7%, an absolute decrease of &#x02265;0.5%, a relative increase of &#x02265;10% and an absolute increase of &#x02265;0.5%) will be evaluated in logistic regression models adjusted for the baseline HbA1c level and clinical centre [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><p>For secondary outcomes, all continuous variables will be analysed via analysis of covariance using a model similar to that specified for the primary outcome. Analyses of binary variables will be based on logistic regression models adjusted for group and clinical centre. For secondary analyses, missing values will be imputed using the Last Observation Carried Forward method. The safety and efficacy of periodontal treatment will be assessed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], as will the correlation between clinical response to periodontal treatment and HbA1c levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The proportion of subjects who had one or more adverse events in the two groups will be compared by means of Fisher's exact test.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>All participants will have to provide written informed consent. The informed consent form will contain the following information: names and affiliations of investigators, a plain language description of the study (treatment group, control group and intervention), the duration of the study, the right to withdraw at any time, the ethics committee approval and the privacy guarantee. All participants will receive free periodontal treatment (immediate or delayed).</p><p>The protocol and procedures have been approved by ethics and regulatory agencies and are implemented in accordance with provisions of the Declaration of Helsinki and French Good Clinical Practice guidelines for periodontal treatment in diabetic patients. The appropriate Committee for Protection of Research Subjects (Comit&#x000e9; de Protection des Personnes [CPP], Sud-Ouest Outre-Mer I), approved the protocol on February 23rd, 2009. The Sanitary Safety of Health Products Agency (Agence fran&#x000e7;aise de s&#x000e9;curit&#x000e9; sanitaire des produits de sant&#x000e9; [AFSSAPS]), approved it on February 12th, 2009 (ref: 2008-A01467-48). The Advisory Committee for Data Processing in Health Research (Comit&#x000e9; consultatif sur le traitement de l'information en mati&#x000e8;re de recherche dans le domaine de la sant&#x000e9; [CCTIRS]), gave its approval on January 15th, 2009.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>We aim to use a two-centre, randomized, controlled trial to investigate whether periodontal treatment could lead to an improvement in glycaemic control in metabolically unbalanced diabetic patients suffering from periodontitis. The results of this trial will help to provide evidence-based recommendations for clinicians and a draft framework for designing local and national health policies.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ATB: systemic antibiotherapy; BOP: bleeding on probing; CAL: clinical attachment level; HbA1c: glycated hemoglobin; OHI: oral health instructions; PISA: periodontal inflamed surface area; PPD: periodontal pocket depth; SRP: scaling and root planing.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>MS is the trial co-ordinator.
