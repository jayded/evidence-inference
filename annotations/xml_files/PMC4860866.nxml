While a similar depth of improvement, whether by ACR responses, CDAI or SDAI, was reported in most patients, many achieved a response by one measure but not all.</p><p>As would be expected,<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> there was a high level of agreement between rates of LDA and remission defined by SDAI and CDAI. Consistent with observations in a clinical setting,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> the level of discordance between SDAI/CDAI and ACR responses was higher when comparing ACR70 and SDAI/CDAI remission to ACR50 and SDAI/CDAI LDA; more patients achieve ACR70 response than achieve SDAI or CDAI remission, as these definitions of remission represent a higher threshold of response than ACR70. Achievement of LDA by SDAI or CDAI is a lower threshold; thus, it is more likely that patients who achieve SDAI or CDAI LDA will also be ACR50 responders.</p><p>Among ACR50 responders or patients who achieved SDAI/CDAI LDA, more patients treated with tofacitinib (63&#x02013;72%) also reported improvements in physical function defined by reductions in HAQ-DI score to less than normative levels, compared with MTX-treated patients (49&#x02013;52%). Across all treatment groups, most patients (70&#x02013;88%) who achieved SDAI/CDAI remission or were ACR70 responders also reported HAQ-DI scores &#x0003c;0.5. Although patients receiving tofacitinib and MTX achieved clinically meaningful responses such as LDA or remission, the depth of response seen with tofacitinib-treated patients was associated with quantifiably more improvements in PROs than MTX. Furthermore, although there were differences in individual efficacy responses between the two tofacitinib doses, discordance between efficacy responses was similar with tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x02005;mg twice daily.</p><p>ACR50 responders reported greater and more consistent improvements in PtGA and pain compared with those who achieved CDAI LDA or reported HAQ-DI &#x0003c;0.5. This should be expected, as ACR criteria require improvement of &#x02265;20%, 50% or 70% in at least three of the following&#x02014;PtGA, pain, HAQ-DI, PGA and an acute phase reactant (erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C reactive protein)&#x02014;to achieve an ACR response,<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> whereas SDAI and CDAI do not include pain or HAQ-DI as part of the criteria. These results suggest that, in addition to achieving SDAI and/or CDAI LDA or remission, clinically meaningful improvements in PROs should be taken into account by the physician and patient in determining continued treatment or changes in treatment. As expected, at the higher level of ACR70 responses or the more stringent level of SDAI and/or CDAI remission, patients reported even greater improvements in PtGA and pain, which were similar across the clinical response definitions as well as between treatment groups.</p><p>Despite the overlap between these clinical measures, there is a large discordance between ACR70 and SDAI/CDAI. ACR responses reflect a &#x02018;change&#x02019; in the disease course measured between two time points, whereas SDAI and CDAI scores measure both disease &#x02018;change&#x02019; and disease &#x02018;state&#x02019;. Thus, patients who achieve SDAI and/or CDAI remission have minimal or no tender or swollen joints, and minimal or no disease activity assessed by the physician and patient; patients who achieve an ACR70 may have considerably more tender and swollen joints and disease activity, but satisfy response criteria due to sufficient change in disease activity (eg, a patient with initial SJC and TJC of 20 each and PtGA/PGA of 7 who responds to therapy and has subsequent SJC and TJC of 6 and PtGA and/or PGA of 2 has achieved an ACR70 but will have CDAI of 14, which is moderate disease activity and not LDA or remission). At the current time, SDAI or Boolean remissions are key components of the treat-to-target goals.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> HAQ-DI measures functional &#x02018;state&#x02019; and functional &#x02018;change&#x02019;, but the goal of achieving HAQ-DI &#x0003c;0.5 is stringent, particularly for patients with long-standing disease. Improvements in PROs that are important to patients also need to be part of treatment goals. This was demonstrated by two international surveys showing that patients were reticent to discuss with their physicians persistent pain, fatigue and the effect of their disease on personal and social relationships.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> It was also illustrated in the goals patients set when initiating new therapies, often with the same desired outcome at 3&#x02005;months, but with little knowledge of the term &#x02018;treat-to-target&#x02019;.</p><p>As opposed to this subanalysis, which showed that clinically significant improvements in ACR70, SDAI or CDAI remission were associated with &#x02265;70% of patients achieving an HAQ-DI score &#x0003c;0.5, an analysis of an observational RA cohort showed that achieving CDAI LDA or remission was associated only with modest improvements in PROs.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> In contradistinction to this observational cohort, most patients in a trial of a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) in MTX-inadequate responders (MTX-IR) who achieved CDAI LDA or remission also achieved &#x02018;remission&#x02019; based on Routine Assessment of Patient Index Data 3 (RAPID3) scores, which is calculated from the values in the HAQ-DI of physical function, pain and PtGA.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Another trial of TNFi in MTX-IR, utilising the same TNFi, showed moderate-to-high correlations between SDAI/CDAI and PROs: PtGA, pain, HAQ-DI and HRQoL by 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36).<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Limitations of these analyses include the lack of formal statistical testing to assess agreement between outcomes. Another limitation is that subjects randomised in this study who had not previously received MTX may not necessarily be patients with early RA, although a majority were diagnosed with disease for &#x0003c;1&#x02005;year. Finally, in this study, we performed analyses based on the ACR/European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) index-based definition of remission (SDAI &#x02264;3.3), but did not perform analyses using the ACR/EULAR Boolean criteria.</p><p>These analyses highlight differences in levels of response between specific PROs and clinical measures of ACR response, SDAI and CDAI at the individual patient level in MTX-na&#x000ef;ve patients, and differences in achieving modest improvements (ACR50, SDAI and CDAI LDA) compared with significant improvements (ACR70, SDAI and CDAI remission). The goal of treatment should be to achieve clinical remission by CDAI/SDAI or ACR/EULAR Boolean definitions and clinically meaningful improvements in PROs that are important to the individual patient, which are more likely to be achieved with a deep clinical response. This study provides insight into important correlations between attainment of clinical responses and clinically meaningful improvements in PROs, using both as tools for measuring effectiveness of treatment.<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SM1"/></p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SM1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/rmdopen-2015-000232.supp1</object-id><label>Supplementary data</label><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss1" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="rmdopen-2015-000232supp.pdf" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>Medical writing support was provided by Erin Bekes, PhD, of Complete Medical Communications and was funded by Pfizer Inc.
