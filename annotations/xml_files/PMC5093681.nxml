This was established in our research from 2014<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and has led us to recommend anxiety screening of ICD patients<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> with the purpose of starting relevant therapy.</p><p>About 20&#x02013;25% of all ICD patients experience anxiety.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> The burden does not seem to be different depending on indication.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Data from the Danish Health and Medicines Authority show that anxiety is the one condition that causes the highest amount of lost work hours and costs Danish society around 8.6 billion DKK in lost earnings.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Europe has an average ICD implantation rate of 140 per million inhabitants and in 2013, a total of 1180 first-time ICDs were implanted in Denmark, equalling 214 per million per year. In total, &#x0223c;8000 citizens in Denmark live with an ICD.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>There are physiological and behavioural processes that lead to inappropriate cardiac outcomes due to anxiety. Suggested models of the relationship between psychology and heart disease highlight the role of the autonomic nervous system. Psychological factors stimulate the autonomic nervous system, which triggers production of catecholamines, increases blood pressure, decreases plasma volume, constricts coronary arteries and increases cardiac demand, platelet activity, coagulation and inflammation. Consequently, patients suffer increased thrombogenesis, arrhythmogenesis, reduced heart rate variability, increased myocardial oxygen demand, myocardial ischaemia and impaired ventricular function.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Moser and Jong have summarised the behavioural mechanisms that are another link between anxiety and cardiac disease. Individuals with high anxiety (compared with non-anxious individuals) have more unhealthy food intake,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> smoke more,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;11</xref> consume more drugs or alcohol,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>

<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> one prospective observational study,<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> one cross-sectional study,<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> four case&#x02013;control studies<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19&#x02013;22</xref> and three case studies.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref> These studies suffer from methodological limitations, which is why conclusive evidence does not exist. However, the two RCTs both find a significant difference in anxiety over time in the CBT group compared with the control group.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>
<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In both trials, the inclusion did not distinguish between patients with and without anxiety and no screening was performed. In a paper from 2015, screening was performed in 690 ICD patients. Moderate to severe anxiety was found in 70 patients and 29 were randomised in a pilot CBT versus usual care trial. Significant differences were found after three CBT sessions.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> All interventional trials were small and the intervention was very short.

It will also focus on lifestyle habits. CBT will be targeted on the specific type of anxiety based on the DSM criteria. The therapy will focus on the patient's thoughts and feelings and the actions that come with it, or the fundamental assumptions that cause these thoughts.</p><p>The methods of the therapeutic procedure are based on learning theories and the fundament of cognitive therapy was established by the psychiatrist Aron T. Beck in the 1960s.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> For each type of anxiety (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, specific phobia, obsessive phobia, post-traumatic stress, generalised anxiety, anxiety due to a general medical condition, anxiety disorder not otherwise specified), a specific protocol will be followed based on CBT. The treatment of anxiety in ICD patients will contain some overall components:
<list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Analysis of the problem: The patient's actual problems will be identified and related to life story relations and components that influence this, for example, cardiac arrest. The way in which assumptions and strategies established earlier in life have an impact on the problem and on the negative thoughts that are characteristic in relation to anxiety will be investigated.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Psycho-education: This focuses on the dissemination of information to the patient about the heart disease, ICD and coping with everyday life. In relation to anxiety, there will often be a need to help the patient gain insight into the sympathetic nervous system's role in relation to development of anxiety and increase knowledge of the association between negative automatic thoughts (catastrophic thoughts), bodily intuitions, feelings and actions and how, for example, behaviour experiments/exposure can reduce anxiety in many situations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Restructuring of negative automatic thoughts: Preparation of a thought journal where the nurse and patients analyse problematic situations by distinguishing &#x02018;situation&#x02019;, &#x02018;physical feelings&#x02019;, &#x02018;feelings&#x02019;, &#x02018;automatic negative way of thinking&#x02019; and &#x02018;behaviour&#x02019;.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Planned behaviour experiments, consisting of systematic exposure to situations that trigger the anxiety.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Homework, for example, registration of the relationship between thoughts, feelings and bodily sensations.

HADS is a 14-item questionnaire that assesses anxiety and depression level in medically ill persons who are not admitted in psychiatric wards. The scale offers two scores, HADS-A and HADS-D, and consists of seven questions to assess anxiety and seven questions to assess depression. HADS is a validated tool with Cronbach's &#x003b1; of 0.83 and 0.82. Scores of 0&#x02013;7 for the two subscales are regarded as normal and scores of 8&#x02013;10 suggest the presence of a mood disorder.

It was developed as a measure to discriminate between anxiety and depression.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> The 21-item questionnaire assesses symptoms such as nervousness, dizziness and fear of dying. The BAI score ranges from 0 to 63 and is interpreted as follows: 0&#x02013;9, normal or no anxiety; 10&#x02013;18, mild to moderate anxiety; 19&#x02013;29, moderate to severe anxiety; and 30&#x02013;63, severe anxiety. The BAI has been proved to be highly internally consistent with Cronbach's &#x003b1; of 0.94 and acceptably reliable over an average time lapse of 11&#x02005;days (r=0.67).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>The Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A): A clinical interview rating scale of the psychic and somatic aspects of anxiety.

<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> A manual for the rating of symptoms is used. The score ranges from 0 to 56 and a score of 0&#x02013;7 is interpreted as no anxiety disorder, 8&#x02013;14 as questionable anxiety disorder, 15&#x02013;19 as mild anxiety disorder, 20&#x02013;29 as moderate anxiety disorder and 30&#x02013;56 as severe anxiety disorder. The reliability and concurrent validity of the HAM-A has proved to be sufficient with an intraclass coefficient of 0.74 and a Spearman coefficient of 0.63.<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></p><p>HeartQoL: A disease-specific questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life in patients with heart disease. The questionnaire consists of 14 items and provides two subscales: a 10-item physical subscale and a 4-item emotional subscale, which are scored from 0 to 3.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> The questionnaire has proven to be a reliable instrument with Cronbach's &#x003b1; between 0.80 and 0.91 for the global score and each subscale and to be responsive in patients with a wide spectrum of cardiac diagnoses.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38&#x02013;40</xref></p><sec id="s2f1a"><title>Exploratory outcomes</title><p>ICD shock, time to first shock and antitachycardia pacing (ATP) will be evaluated due to the risk of arrhythmia stimulated by increased activation of the autonomic nervous system. Data will be gathered from the national ICD register that holds information on all national ICD and cardiac resynchronisation therapy device implantations. No difference is expected between groups due to the small sample size. We will still explore this outcome for the purpose of later meta-analyses and data gathering for sample size estimation in future trials.</p><p>Heart rate variability: Evo, Spacelab USA, is a portable device for continuous monitoring of various electrical variables of the cardiovascular system. Heart rate variability, blood pressure and heart rate are all responsive to sympathetic activity, which can be increased by anxiety. Heart rate variability refers to the beat-to-beat variation in the RR interval and is a marker of autonomic nervous system activity.<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> Reduced heart rate variability is a powerful and independent predictor of short-term and long-term mortality in cardiac patients.<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>

Results of the trial are analysed by an independent statistician, and the results will be interpreted by the research group.

If the patient gives permission, data will be included in the final analysis.</p><sec id="s2l1"><title>Data management</title><p>Questionnaire responses will be typed and stored in a secure folder with limited access on the hospital server. The questionnaire data will be placed in one folder and identified with a study participant number and in another folder, the participant&#x02019;s personal identification number will be stored with the matching study participant number.</p><p>Individual patient data will be handled as normal data and records will be protected according to the Act on Processing of Personal Data and the Danish Health Care Act. Data will be stored in accordance with Danish Data Protection Agency rules. Anonymous data that are encoded with the individual patient code will be entered into the computerised database and transferred for analysis portal in encrypted mode. This system meets all criteria for the handling of patient data in accordance with the laws on the processing of personal data. All original records are stored at Rigshospitalet for 15&#x02005;years to allow inspections by competent authorities. The trial database will be preserved for 15&#x02005;years and anonymised. After analysis, experimental data will be submitted to the Danish Data Archives.</p></sec><sec id="s2l2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The primary analyses will be performed according to the intention-to-treat principle and we will use a mixed model with repeated measurements for continuous outcomes. For binary outcomes (HADS-A score &#x0003c;8), we use a generalised mixed model with repeated measurements. By using mixed models, we ensure that missing data do not create bias as long as they are missing at random. In the case of significant results in the primary outcome, sensitivity analyses will be performed to estimate the potential effect of data missing at random by a worst-case scenario. Let A be the group where a beneficial significant effect is observed and B be the other group. Missing values in group A will be imputed by the minimum value found in the material and missing values in group B will be imputed by the maximum value found. The primary outcome will first be tested using a significance level of 0.05. Analyses of the secondary outcome measures as preplanned in the protocol will be analysed with no adjustment of p values due to multiplicity. Instead, the interpretation of each secondary outcome measure will be assessed in the light of multiple testing, that is, statistically significant effects will be interpreted in the context of increased risk of type I error. No significance testing will be performed for the exploratory outcomes. The clinical effect size is analysed by Cohen's d. Significance level is set at 5%. SAS V.9.3 is used for the analyses (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2m"><title>Data monitoring</title><p>Owing to the small sample size, no data monitoring committee is established and no interim analyses will be performed.</p></sec><sec id="s2n"><title>Harms</title><p>No risks are expected.
