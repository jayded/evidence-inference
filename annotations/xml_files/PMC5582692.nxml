Therefore, the pediatric IKDC was developed, which involved splitting of complicated questions and language modification to create a more understandable form for patients 10 to 18 years old. With the clarification of language and questions, the newer pediatric IKDC could be easier to understand for adults as well.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>The selection of an appropriate PRO is especially important given that physicians now have multiple potential outcome assessments available for patients with knee injuries.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> This makes PRO selection and testing even more important for specific populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup></p><p>Accurate longitudinal studies require the use of the same PRO throughout follow-up. If the pediatric IKDC is used in adolescent subjects, follow-up of these same patients into adulthood may lead to confusion regarding whether the adult or pediatric form should be used. Therefore, it would be best for either one form or the other to be selected for use in adolescents and continued into adulthood. If the pediatric version is more easily understood without any clinically significant difference compared with the adult version, then it could be used in adults as well. In a comparison of the pediatric and adult versions of the IKDC in an adolescent population (aged 13-17 years), there was no clinically significant difference (unpublished data, 2015). The current study aims to (1) compare the scores of the adult and pediatric versions of the IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation Form in adults with knee conditions and (2) determine whether the scores are highly correlated and can be converted between each other. We hypothesize that there will be no clinically significant difference in the adult and pediatric IKDC form scores in adults, aged 18 to 50 years, presenting to orthopaedic outpatient clinics with knee conditions.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="section9-1941738116685299"><title>Methods</title><sec id="section10-1941738116685299"><title>Participants</title><p>This study was approved by the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Review Board and all participants gave informed consent prior to enrollment in the study.

All participants completed both the pediatric and adult versions of the IKDC. However, the order in which a participant completed these forms (ie, pediatric version first or second) was randomized using REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture). Simple randomization was used. The participants were blinded to the form version. All participants were given a 10-minute break between finishing the first form and beginning the second form; this study design was similar to that used by Gudbergsen et al<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> and Bischoff-Ferrari et al<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> in their comparison of PROs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1-1941738116685299">Figure 1</xref>). After completion of the second survey, all participants were asked which version (first or second) they preferred. The IKDC forms and the postsurvey preference question were completed on computers in the clinical setting. All participants were compensated for their time with a $10 gift card. The study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture tools.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> REDCap is a secure, web-based application designed to support data capture for research studies, providing: (1) an intuitive interface for validated data entry, (2) audit trails for tracking data manipulation and export procedures, (3) automated export procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages, and (4) procedures for importing data from external sources.</p></sec><sec id="section12-1941738116685299"><title>Study Instruments</title><p>The IKDC Subjective Knee Form was designed for the purpose of detecting a change, either improvement or deterioration, in symptoms, function, and sports activity in patients with a variety of knee conditions.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The IKDC is knee-specific and can be used for ligament and meniscal injuries, articular cartilage lesions, patellofemoral pain, and other conditions.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> It was developed to reflect symptoms and limitations in function and sports activity due to a knee condition, and it was designed to maximize reliability, responsiveness, and validity.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The IKDC Subjective Knee Evaluation Form is scored by summing the scores for the individual items, and this is then transformed to a scale that ranges from 0 to 100 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sportsmed.org/research/IKDC_forms/">http://www.sportsmed.org/research/IKDC_forms/</ext-link>). The score is interpreted as a measure of function, with higher scores representing higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. Thus, a score of 100 would indicate no limitation in daily or sports activities and no symptoms. The pediatric and adult versions are scored in the same way, but the pediatric version has 21 items, rather than 18, because of the splitting of some questions for clarity. The pediatric version also includes some modifications in language. Previously, the pediatric IKDC has been shown to be reliable, valid, and responsive in the pediatric population.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p></sec><sec id="section13-1941738116685299"><title>Statistics</title><p>The sample size calculation was performed using G*Power1 (version 3.1) software and 1-sided testing with a significance level of 5%.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> To obtain 90% power to detect a 5-unit difference between mean IKDC version scores, assuming a standard deviation of 20 and a conservative correlation of 0.75, 87 participants were required. Based on this calculation, we aimed to enroll 100 participants. Paired <italic>t</italic> tests were used to test for a difference in the adult and pediatric IKDC scores and to test for a difference in the times required to complete the adult and pediatric IKDC versions. Because the distribution of times was skewed, the times were transformed onto a log scale for comparison and then transformed back to their original units to present results. To test for equivalence between the adult and pediatric IKDC scores, a 1-sided equivalence test was performed, assuming an equivalence region of 5 points. This equivalence region was selected because it is lower than the clinically important difference reported for the adult IKDC, which ranges from 6.3 to 20.5.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> For this test, the null hypothesis states that the difference in the pediatric and adult IKDC scores is greater than 5, and the alternative hypothesis states that this difference is less than 5. Therefore, a significant <italic>P</italic> value (&#x0003c;0.05) indicates that the evidence is sufficient to show the pediatric and adult IKDC mean scores are equivalent for clinical purposes. Least-squares models were used to generate formulas that allow for the prediction of adult scores when given pediatric scores and vice versa. Performance of these models was assessed using mean squared errors and <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> values. All calculations were done using R software (version 3.1.1).

A paired <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare these durations, and a transformation to the log scale was performed prior to the test because of the skewed distribution of the IKDC times. The mean amount of time required to complete the pediatric version was found to be approximately 1.11 times greater than the time required to complete the adult version, with a <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.001 and a 95% CI of 1.06 to 1.16. However, from a practical perspective, this difference is &#x0003c;30 seconds on average.</p></sec><sec id="section19-1941738116685299"><title>Participant Preference</title><p>Thirty-three percent of participants preferred the adult version of the IKDC, and 38% of participants preferred the pediatric version of the IKDC. The remaining 29% had no preference.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="section20-1941738116685299"><title>Discussion</title><p>This study revealed a statistically significant 1.6-point difference between the adult and pediatric IKDC scores with a 95% CI of 0.54 to 2.66. Clinical importance was not demonstrated as this difference was less than the a priori 5-point threshold set for clinical significance. This conclusion is further supported by equivalence testing, which revealed that the adult and pediatric IKDC scores were equivalent within an equivalence region of 5 points. This evidence demonstrates that there is no difference clinically between the adult and pediatric IKDC forms when administered to adults aged 18 to 50 years. The scores were highly correlated, with a linear relationship having an <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> of 92.6%. This relationship can be used to predict 1 score when given the other. Both forms took approximately 3 minutes to complete. The difference in times to completion was statistically significant, although the magnitude of this difference was &#x0003c;30 seconds.</p><p>Longitudinal cohort studies have revealed the need for the current study.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Confusion arises when participants are evaluated longitudinally and their age crosses the 18-year-old mark. In longitudinal studies using the IKDC forms, the pediatric IKDC is validated for use at baseline (at an age &#x0003c;18 years) and was created specifically for use in the pediatric population. However, the pediatric IKDC has not been validated for use in adults, so it cannot be used at follow-up if the patient has passed the age of 18 years. Ideally, the same form should be used at baseline and follow-up, whether it is the adult or pediatric IKDC. The adult IKDC could be used in the adolescent population at baseline and follow-up, as it has demonstrated validity in the 13- to 17-year-old age group and has been shown to have no clinically significant difference in adolescents (SR Oak, unpublished data, 2015).<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> However, cognitive interviewing has shown that children aged 10 to 18 years have difficulty comprehending the IKDC questions from the adult version.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In addition to language modification, the pediatric version has also been improved by splitting questions to eliminate double-barrel questions. Since the pediatric version has been developed to be more clearly worded, it is well suited for use in the adult population as well.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study. First, the sample was limited to patients presenting in outpatient orthopaedic clinics at 1 institution. Furthermore, convenience sampling may have introduced selection bias into the study. However, the sample included a wide range of knee-specific diagnoses, ages, and education levels and a fairly even sex distribution, which indicates that, hopefully, this bias was minimal. Additionally, the scores and correlation of the pediatric IKDC in adults were evaluated, as compared with the adult IKDC. We did not evaluate validity or responsiveness, and we did not compare individual components of each form. Although validity, reliability, and responsiveness have already been evaluated in the adult population for the adult IKDC Subjective Knee Form, these have not all been evaluated for the pediatric IKDC in the adult population.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1941738116685299" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> The 2 versions appear to be clinically equivalent; the psychometric properties of the pediatric IKDC in the adult population should also be equivalent.</p><p>In conclusion, there was no clinically significant difference between the pediatric and adult IKDC scores in adults, aged 18 to 50 years, who were being seen in orthopaedic outpatient clinics for knee problems. This result indicates that follow-up using whichever form was originally used in a longitudinal study is possible. Furthermore, the scores were highly correlated and can be converted between each other with reliability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the following individuals who allowed us to enroll patients from their clinics into our study: Richard Parker, MD, Jennifer Ogorzolka, PA-C, Kieran Coughlin, PA-C, Julia Brasfield, PA-C, Bridget Mansell, PA-C, and Elizabeth Sosic, project manager.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p>The authors report no potential conflicts of interest in the development and publication of this article.
