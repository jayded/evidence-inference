Different factors affect the bond strength in fixed orthodontic treatment [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. The effects of acidic foods, acidic and alcoholic beverages, herbal teas and different chemical solvents on the bond strength of orthodontic brackets have been investigated by researchers [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Aside from increasing the risk of bond failure, these substances may increase the incidence of caries and periodontal problems and can lead to patient dissatisfaction [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Decreased pH and higher lactobacillus and Streptococcus mutans count increase the susceptibility to caries [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Following orthodontic bracket placement, number of microorganisms increases by 6&#x02013;10% [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Plaque formation in orthodontic patients is two to three times more than in nonorthodontic adult patients with a high dental plaque score [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Incidence of caries and gingivitis also increases in orthodontic patients [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Drop in salivary pH due to plaque formation and bacterial activity is considered the main cause of enamel demineralization [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Enamel demineralization starts at a pH of 5&#x02013;5.5 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>].</p><p>The effect of salivary pH on SBS of orthodontic brackets has not been studied. The present study was designed to answer the question whether bond failure of orthodontic brackets occurs more frequently in patients with decreased salivary pH.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>In this in vitro study, 80 intact premolar teeth extracted in the past six months for orthodontic reasons were used.</p><p>The teeth were examined under dental unit light to exclude the cracked ones, and washed under running water before storage in distilled water. After collecting the teeth, they were placed in 0.1% thymol solution for one week for disinfection, and then immersed in distilled water again to prevent dehydration. The buccal surfaces were cleaned by dental prophylactic brush under running water, dried, etched with 37% phosphoric acid gel for 30 seconds, rinsed for 20 seconds and dried. A white chalky surface appeared. The buccal surface of the teeth was cleaned using non-fluoridated pumice powder and prophylactic rubber cups for 15 seconds, rinsed and dried with air spray. After cleaning, the teeth were conditioned with 37% phosphoric acid gel (Fine etch Co, Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea) for 20 seconds and dried with oil- and moisture-free air spray until a frosty white appearance was achieved.</p><p>Stainless steel standard edgewise premolar brackets (Dentaurum GmbH &#x00026; Co. KG, Ispringen, Germany) were used in this study. After etching, a thin adhesive resin layer (Unitek, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA) was applied to the buccal surface of the teeth and the bracket bases were coated with composite resin (Unitek, 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA). The brackets were positioned at four-millimeter distance from the buccal cusp tip using a special gauge. After removal of excess composite with a dental explorer, adhesive was cured using light-emitting diode (LED) light curing unit (LED Curing, Morita, Kyoto, Japan) for 20 seconds (five seconds from each of the occlusal, gingival, mesial and distal directions). After bonding, the teeth were randomly divided into four groups. Each group was incubated in artificial saliva with a specific pH in similar conditions for two months. Since the normal salivary pH is 6.8 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and the critical pH for enamel decalcification is 5.5 [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], the pH level of solutions for groups one (control) to four was adjusted at 6.8, 5.8, 4.8, and 3.8, respectively. The solutions were refreshed weekly. Artificial saliva was prepared by dissolving 0.4g NaCl, 1.21g KCl, 0.78g NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2H<sub>2</sub>O; 0.005g Na<sub>2</sub>S, 9H<sub>2</sub>O and 1g CO(NH<sub>2</sub>)2 in 1000mL of deionized distilled water. Buffers were used to adjust pH. The solutions were autoclave sterilized [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Each tooth was embedded in self-cured acrylic block, with the crown exposed. The SBS was measured using a Dartec HC10 universal testing machine (Zwick Ltd., Herefordshire, UK) while the buccal surface was parallel to the direction of force at a crosshead speed of 0.5mm/min with a 0.5mm-thick blade.</p><p>The SBS was calculated by dividing the force at fracture by the base of the bracket and reported in megapascals (MPa).</p><p>After debonding, the enamel surfaces were examined under a stereomicroscope (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) at &#x000d7;10 magnification to evaluate the amount of remaining adhesive. The adhesive remnant on the surface was scored using adhesive remnant index (ARI) of Oliver [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. This index is scored based on the percentage of adhesive remained on the surface. The scores are: one, 100%; two, more than 90%; three, between 10&#x02013;90%; four, less than 10%; and five, 0%.</p><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Descriptive statistics including the mean and standard deviation (SD) of SBS values were calculated by means of statistical package for social sciences (SPSS) (SPSS for windows, release 10.0.0, Chicago, IL, USA). The Kolmogorov &#x02013; Simonov test showed normal distribution of data. The ANOVA and Tukey&#x02019;s post hoc test were used for multiple comparisons of SBS between the groups. To evaluate differences in ARI scores, the Kruskal&#x02013;Wallis test was applied. P&#x0003c;0.05 was considered significant for all statistical tests.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The obtained SBS values are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>.

Having a higher mean SBS value might be related to higher level of pH. Oncag and coworkers in 2005 reported that acidic beverages, by decalcifying the enamel surrounding the brackets, have negative effects on the bond strength at the bracket-enamel interface [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Lee and coworkers in 1996 evaluated the effect of liquids, simulating foods and drinks, on SBS of brackets. In their study, extracted intact premolars with bonded brackets were stored in buffered lactic acid with a pH of four, and corn oil for 12 weeks. Their results showed that 50% ethanol and lactic acid with a pH of four caused the lowest SBS [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Ulusoy and coworkers in 2009 studied the effects of different kinds of tea on SBS of orthodontic brackets. In their study, 90 intact premolars were assigned to six groups. Four of them were immersed in four different kinds of tea including: black tea, green tea, tea with lime flavor and fruit tea. Two other groups were subjected to a carbonated beverage (Coca Cola), and distilled water as controls. The results showed a direct correlation between the pH of beverages and the SBS of orthodontic brackets [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Statistical tests revealed significant differences among groups in terms of ARI scores. The ARI scores showed that in an acidic environment, bond failures were mostly at the bracket-adhesive interface. Softened adhesive compromises the bracket&#x02013;adhesive interlocking. Acids and acidic beverages may damage bisphenol A glycidyl methacrylate in the composite structure [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p><p>When the resin matrix softens, fillers may become dislodged, decreasing the SBS [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Oral hygiene, nutrition, and bonding technique are the most effective factors determining the degree of erosion. Reduction of pH below 5.5 creates a favorable environment for enamel erosion [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Steffen stated that the cariogenic activity of bacteria in the oral cavity is accelerated in presence of acidic beverages [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>In the current study, group one (pH of 3.8) showed the least SBS value, which was significantly different from that of other groups. This study suggests that acidic oral environment, due to poor oral hygiene, malnutrition, and frequent use of acidic beverages, may be the reason of increased incidence of bond failure in these orthodontic patients.</p><p>Although Oncag and coworkers showed that only extremely acidic oral environment (pH=2&#x02013;3) may reduce the SBS [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], in-vitro environment may be different from in-vivo, and also other factors may play roles in reducing the SBS. We can prevent bond failure and its consequences by encouraging patients to maintain good oral hygiene and limit the use of acidic beverages such as Cola.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The results of this study showed that:
