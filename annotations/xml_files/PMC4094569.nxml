Patients received once-daily olodaterol 5 or 10 &#x003bc;g, twice-daily formoterol 12 &#x003bc;g, or placebo. Co-primary end points were forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) area under the curve from 0&#x02013;3 hours response, FEV<sub>1</sub> trough response, and Mahler transition dyspnea index total score after 24 weeks; secondary end points included St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire. Overall, 904 (Study 1222.13) and 934 (Study 1222.14) patients received treatment. Olodaterol significantly improved FEV<sub>1</sub> area under the curve from 0&#x02013;3 hours versus placebo in both studies (with olodaterol 5 &#x003bc;g, 0.151 L and 0.129 L; with olodaterol 10 &#x003bc;g, 0.165 L and 0.154 L; for all comparisons <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and FEV<sub>1</sub> trough responses versus placebo (0.053&#x02013;0.085 L; <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.01), as did formoterol. Primary analysis revealed no significant difference in transition dyspnea index focal score for any active treatment versus placebo. Post hoc analysis using pattern mixture modeling (accounting for discontinuations) demonstrated statistical significance for olodaterol versus placebo. St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire total score was significantly improved with olodaterol, but not formoterol, versus placebo. No safety signals were identified from adverse-event or other safety data. Once-daily olodaterol 5 &#x003bc;g and 10 &#x003bc;g is efficacious in patients with moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease on usual-care maintenance therapy, with a satisfactory safety profile.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>bronchodilator</kwd><kwd>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</kwd><kwd>dyspnea</kwd><kwd>long-acting beta2-agonist</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long-acting bronchodilators, such as long-acting &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub>-agonists (LABAs) and long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMAs), are well established as the cornerstone of maintenance therapy for moderate to very severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).<xref rid="b1-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></p><p>The first available long-acting bronchodilators (such as the LABAs formoterol and salmeterol)<xref rid="b3-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> had a duration of action that necessitated twice-daily (BID) dosing.

Lung function of 5 and 10 &#x003bc;g olodaterol was examined in two sets of replicate pivotal studies in patients with moderate to very severe COPD: one set investigated the efficacy of olodaterol versus placebo after 12 weeks in a population including US patients (NCT00782210; NCT00782509), while the other set, described here, compared the efficacy of olodaterol with placebo and formoterol after 24 weeks in a population not including US patients (Study 1222.13: NCT00793624; Study 1222.14: NCT00796653).

Results for the secondary spirometric end points support the primary end points, demonstrating the maintained efficacy of QD olodaterol 5 and 10 &#x003bc;g over a 48-week period. FEV<sub>1</sub> AUC<sub>0&#x02013;3</sub> and FEV<sub>1</sub> trough response were designated co-primary end points in recognition of the importance of considering these measures together when assessing the optimal dose of a new QD bronchodilator.</p><p>There were no statistically significant differences from placebo in TDI score using the prespecified MMRM analysis. However, the unexpected improvement observed in TDI focal score in the placebo group at 24 weeks in Study 1222.13 meant that the prespecified combined MMRM analysis could not be considered a reliable estimate of effect size, as comparability of data between studies was a prerequisite for the combined analysis of TDI focal scores.</p><p>Following identification of a higher discontinuation rate in the placebo group in this study, it was decided to employ additional post hoc PMM analysis to overcome any inconsistencies this may have introduced.<xref rid="b24-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> PMM provided more consistent responses versus placebo throughout the study and, overall, the data suggest dyspnea is improved with olodaterol 5 and 10 &#x003bc;g versus placebo. Due to the hierarchical testing model used for these analyses, SGRQ results can be considered as descriptive only, indicating nominally statistically significant responses with olodaterol versus placebo at week 24. However, taken together with the responder analysis, the totality of the SGRQ data indicates a benefit with olodaterol compared to placebo.</p><p>When interpreting these study results, some additional factors should be considered. Firstly, in this study, FEV<sub>1</sub> trough was measured in the morning, before the next study dose. More recent olodaterol studies (eg, NCT01040689 and NCT01040728) measured FEV<sub>1</sub> trough at precise time points (eg, at the end of the dosing interval on the day after the primary end point visit), giving the potential for a more uniform measurement. Additionally, the tiotropium-stratum data should not be over-interpreted; a stratified randomization regarding concomitant tiotropium use, and these data merely reflect tiotropium users versus non-users. Evaluation of the efficacy of olodaterol in combination with tiotropium requires a separate trial design and is currently being investigated in a Phase II/III program of olodaterol with tiotropium, as discussed later in this manuscript.</p><p>In addition, the FEV<sub>1</sub> results of this study are difficult to compare with established minimum clinically important differences because there is not an established minimum clinically important difference for trials where the study drug is added to background therapy and patients with very severe COPD are included (ie, in a population closely representative of clinical practice).<xref rid="b17-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In order to put the olodaterol data into context and demonstrate clinically relevant benefits, we included a well-established active comparator (formoterol); the results illustrated similar effects for olodaterol and formoterol.</p><p>The results of these pivotal 48-week studies build on the evidence provided by the Phase II studies<xref rid="b15-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b26-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and are in line with those observed for the other set of pivotal replicate studies (NCT00782210; NCT00782509), which also demonstrated significantly improved lung function with olodaterol versus placebo. The available data for olodaterol create a comprehensive bank of evidence indicating that both 5 and 10 &#x003bc;g achieve 24-hour bronchodilation that provides benefits in lung function with an acceptable safety profile in a population of patients considered to closely represent those in clinical practice.<xref rid="b14-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b27-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b32-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Furthermore, the effects of olodaterol have been demonstrated to translate into benefits downstream of lung function, such as improvements in symptoms and exercise tolerance.<xref rid="b33-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>,<xref rid="b34-copd-9-697" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>Olodaterol was administered via the Respimat<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> device during this clinical program.
