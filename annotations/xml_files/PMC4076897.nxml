Then, three other German investigators reported that glucosamine can decrease joint pain, and improve joint motility. However, because glucosamine is a natural product, many researchers and pharmaceutical companies have not paid enough attention to it until the previous decade. More recently, several studies have reported glucosamine sulfate superior to ibuprofen for treatment of different types of joint problems such as knee or TMJ degenerative joint disorders. Although there are fundamental differences between the TMJ and other synovial joints, studies performed on patients suffering from DJD of joints other than TMJ can be helpful.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Vas <italic>et al</italic>., performed a double blind study on 40 patients with knee osteoarthritis over 8 weeks. Their results showed that glucosamine sulfate was more effective than ibuprofen in relieving symptoms. Muller-Fassbender <italic>et al</italic>., published results of another double blind randomized clinical trial on knee osteoarthritis of 200 patients and found glucosamine sulfate as effective as ibuprofen with fewer adverse effects.[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] Another study on 178 patients by Qiu <italic>et al</italic>., reported similar results, and showed more effectiveness and fewer side effects of treatment with glucosamine sulfate compared with ibuprofen.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Similar to what we found, Thie <italic>et al</italic>., reported that glucosamine sulfate has greater influence in reducing TMJ pain and improvement of jaw movement than ibuprofen.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Comparing with ibuprofen, we found that glucosamine is associated with significantly lower rate of adverse events, which is confirmed by most of the previous studies.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Now, the question is how glucosamine sulfate can compete with ibuprofen, and what its mechanism of action is. Glucosamine sulfate is an aminomonosaccharide and is the crucial part of O-linked and N-linked glycosaminoglycans. Matrix of all connective tissues such as cartilage are formed by glycosaminoglycans.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] Over the previous decades, it has been believed that glucosamine compounds could be effective in ameliorating pain caused by degenerative joint disorders. Glucosamine sulfate acts as a substrate and stimulant of glycosaminoglycan production within articular cartilage, but the exact biochemical effects of glucosamine sulfate - which lead to symptom relief in patients with degenerative joint disorders-are not well known.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] In contrast to glucosamine sulfate, which is not dependent on cyclooxygenase (COX) and can induce cartilage metabolism, traditional NSAIDs act by inhibition of COX and interfere with cartilage metabolism.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In addition to beneficial effects of glucosamine sulfate on cartilage metabolism, this supplement may have some secondary effects including inhibition of catabolic mechanisms of degenerative joint disorders. Proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha induce these destructive events, and it is believed that glucosamine sulfate can inhibit their activities. However, further studies are required to confirm the results of these hypotheses.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>In summary, this investigation demonstrated that comparing with a commonly prescribed NSAID &#x02013; ibuprofen-, glucosamine sulfate may be used as a more effective and safer therapeutic agent for treatment of patients with TMJ degenerative joint disorder.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>All authors contributed the idea or research, design of study, data analysis and manuscript
