To date, there has been no study focusing on the effects of radiotherapy on hydatid disease in large animals. In this study, we aim to investigate the efficiency and safety of radiotherapy for treating hydatid disease caused by <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> in naturally infected sheep.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ultrasound was used to screen naturally infected sheep in an echinococcosis endemic area in Xinjiang, China. A computer tomography (CT) scan confirmed the presence of hydatid cysts. Twenty sheep naturally infected with <italic>E. granulosus</italic> in the liver and/or lungs were randomly assigned into four groups receiving no irradiation, or X-ray irradiation of low (30&#x000a0;Gy), medium (45&#x000a0;Gy), and high dose (60&#x000a0;Gy), respectively. After three months of radiotherapy, a CT scan was performed to measure the changes in the cysts. The hepatic parasite cysts and host tissues were collected for histology and gene expression analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the animals subject to irradiation, no significant differences were observed in their appetite, daily activities, and weight before and after radiotherapy. Severe calcification was noticed in the cysts subject to a high dose of radiation compared with the groups subject to low and medium doses. Hematoxylin and eosin staining showed that irradiation contributed to the damage of the cyst structure and nucleus in the germinal layers. Quantitative PCR demonstrated that expression of TPX and HSP70 significantly decreased in a dose-dependent manner (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). The expression of the EPC1 decreased in the medium- and high-dose groups compared with the low-dose group (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05). Meanwhile, the expression of radiation-related apoptosis genes caspase-3 and Gadd45 decreased with an increase in the irradiation dose.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Radiotherapy is an option with satisfactory efficiency and safety for treating cystic echinococcosis in sheep with partial response or stable disease at month 3. In future, inhibition of cystic activity using radiotherapy may serve as a new regimen for treating hydatid disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s40249-017-0301-7) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Radiotherapy</kwd><kwd>Cystic echinococcosis</kwd><kwd><italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic></kwd><kwd>Effectiveness</kwd><kwd>Safety</kwd><kwd>Treatment</kwd><kwd>Sheep</kwd><kwd>China</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Open Project of State Key Lab Incubation Base of Xinjiang Major Diseases Research</institution></funding-source><award-id>No.SKLIB-XJMDR-2015-Y3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mao</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Multilingual abstracts</title><p>Please see Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref> for translations of the abstract into the five official working languages of the United Nations.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Background</title><p>Cystic echinococcosis (CE), a zoonotic disease caused by <italic>Echinococcus granulosus</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], has become a major public health and economic problem worldwide. An epidemiology survey conducted in 2011 showed that more than 380 000 people were diagnosed with CE in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], but treatment remains a challenge. Currently, surgery is the preferred treatment for CE, however, a higher incidence of relapse has been reported. Albendazole has been widely considered as the first-line drug for treating CE, however, the efficiency of chemotherapy is not satisfactory as the agent concentration in the hydatid cysts was low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new regimen for treating CE.</p><p>Radiotherapy may represent an alternative treatment modality, but there is no adequate evidence for it as yet. Up until now, very few studies have been carried out to evaluate the efficiency of radiotherapy for treating such diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. In 2013, Ulger et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] reported that one patient with hydatid cysts in the chest wall, who showed no response to surgery and drugs, achieved local control and pain relief after radiotherapy. Previous studies conducted by us showed that X-ray is lethal for alveolar hydatid disease as it can increase its mortality rate and inhibit cyst growth in vivo (gerbil) or in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>To date, there has been no study that has investigated the effects of radiotherapy on hydatid disease in large animals worldwide. In this study, we aim to determine the efficiency and safety of radiotherapy to treat CE in naturally infected sheep.</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study subjects</title><p>Twenty naturally infected female sheep (aged 3 &#x02013; 5&#x000a0;years) with liver cystic hydatid disease obtained from the Bayanbulak Grassland (Xinjiang, China) were used in this study.</p><p>CE was confirmed using the ultrasound technique. The anesthesia procedures were as follows: sheep were initially subject to subcutaneous injection of atropine sulfate (0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg), followed by intramuscular injection of Zoletil (5&#x000a0;mg/10&#x000a0;kg, VIRBAC laboratories, 06516 Carros, France) 15&#x000a0;min later. Subsequently, the following agents were given via intravenous injection (1&#x000a0;ml/10&#x000a0;kg): xylazine hydrochloride (batch No.: 130412, Huamu Animal Health-Care Co., Ltd. Changchun), diazepam (batch No. 14060, Jinyao Amino Acids Ltd. Co., Tianjin, China), atropine (Xixiang Changjiang Animal Pharmacy Ltd.

The study protocols were approved by the Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Xinjiang Medical University.</p><p>After anesthesia, thoracic and abdominal CT was performed (slice thickness: 5&#x000a0;mm) to determine the lesion number, size, and location as the baseline characteristics.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Study design</title><p>The sheep were randomly assigned into four groups (with five in each group), including a control group subject to no irradiation; a low-dose irradiation group subject to 30&#x000a0;Gy irradiation; a medium-dose irradiation group subject to 45&#x000a0;Gy irradiation; and a high-dose group subject to 60&#x000a0;Gy irradiation. After anesthesia, each sheep was fixed on an operative table by using a thermoplastic membrane. Subsequently, a computer tomography (CT) scan was performed using a 16-slice Brilliance CT Big Bore scanner (Philips, USA). The proposed irradiation shape was outlined by professional radiologists and radiotherapy was performed by experienced radiotherapists. The radiotherapy was performed in three fractions with an interval of 2 days between each fraction within 7 days to reach the predefined irradiation volume (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Process of radiotherapy. <bold>a</bold> sheep were fixed on an operative table by thermoplastic membrane; <bold>b</bold> radiotherapy was performed by radiotherapist with precise image-guided radiation therapy; <bold>c</bold> radiotherapy was performed using a linear accelerator</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="40249_2017_301_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig>

In human cystic hydatid disease, liver is the most commonly affected organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, sheep naturally infected with <italic>E. granulosus</italic> were used to mimic human infection to investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy in vivo.</p><p>Radiotherapy is commonly used to treat cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. To date, radiotherapy has been used to treat the majority of malignant tumors and more than half of cancer patients would depend on or involve radiotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In addition, radiotherapy can also be used in benign disease treatment, such as scars, hemangioma, genital warts, tinea capitis, or abscess around the hair follicles on the head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>To our best knowledge, only a few clinical studies have been conducted focusing on the efficacy of radiotherapy for treating hydatid disease, mainly carried out in vitro or on rat models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. For example, in 1998, Schmid reported a decrease of cysts after treatment using Gamma knife radiosurgery in a case with cerebral alveolar hydatid disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Zhou et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] were the first to report that heavy-ion radiotherapy was more superior to X-ray in terms of inhibiting the growth of hydatid cysts.</p><p>The maximum dose of radiotherapy should be within the tolerance of normal tissue. As previously described, a dose of 30 &#x02013; 60&#x000a0;Gy/3f is effective with safety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. In this study, the irradiation dose ranged from 0 to 60&#x000a0;Gy. In the three-month follow-up, no significant differences were noticed in the appetite, daily activity, fur, and body weight of the sheep. In addition, no significant differences were observed in the routine blood and liver function tests within each group and among all groups before radiotherapy, as well as three days, one month, and three months after radiotherapy. This indicates that a dose of 30 &#x02013; 60&#x000a0;Gy/3f induced no bone marrow suppression and liver damage in the sheep. Although the rear part of the irradiated liver showed signs of congestion, liver function remained normal due to the high decompensation capacity of the liver. Therefore, the doses adopted in this study are safe for radiotherapy to treat hepatic hydatid disease.</p><p>A CT scan is considered to be an effective way to determine the lesion size of cysts after radiotherapy. In this study, the wall calcification was classified as CE5 according to the World Health Organization ultrasound grading after irradiation, indicating that cystic activity was rather low and did not require surgical intervention. Four sheep (80%) showed significant calcification in the high-dose group (60&#x000a0;Gy) compared with the low-dose group, indicating the damage of the cyst was affected by the radiation in a dose-dependent manner.</p><p>In presence of an intact germinal layer in the cyst, the cyst was filled with hydatid fluid and the cystic tension was high. Upon the destruction of the germinal layer, the tension in the cyst declined. In this study, the tension in the cyst showed obvious decrease in irradiated cysts, together with the collapse of the cystic wall, while the tension in the non-irradiated cysts was still high. Under a microscope, irradiation induced interruption of the stratum corneum and the cyst&#x02019;s germinal layer. As previously described, cyst destruction is a predictor for decreased hydatid activity and vitality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. On this basis, the pathological changes confirmed irradiation contributed to the decline of cyst growth and reproduction, which was consistent with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>To investigate the potential molecular mechanism in the radiation effects on hydatid disease, we determined the expression of related genes using real-time PCR. TPX is expressed in all developmental stages of <italic>E. granulosus</italic>, which is of great importance in repairing the injury induced by reactive oxygen and antagonizing the host immune cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. EPC1 is polypeptide screened from the cDNA library of protoscolex of <italic>E. granulosus</italic> with a sensitivity of 92.2% and a specificity of 95.6% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The protein is present on the surface of the germinal layer and can be used as an indicator for hydatid growth. HSP70 is highly expressed and involved in protein translation, transport, and degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. In our study, the expression of these genes, together with the decrease of the oxidation resistance, growth activity, and oxygen free radicals clearance, was noticed after irradiation in a dose-dependent manner, indicating radiation can kill cysts. Meanwhile, the expression of caspase-3 and Gadd45 related to apoptosis and necrosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>] decreased after radiation. This implied that large doses of radiation would directly cause cell apoptosis and necrosis.</p><p>To further detect EPC1&#x02019;s expression before and after radiotherapy, immunofluorescence detection was carried out. Our results indicate that EPC1 was mainly continuously and linearly distributed along the germinal layer of the non-irradiated normal cyst wall, and intermittently expressed along the germinal layer of the irradiated cyst wall. No expression of EPC1 was noticed in the stratum corneum after irradiation. This indicates that EPC1 expressed in the part near the germinal layer surface and was sensitive to cyst activity. The protein expression decreased after radiotherapy, suggesting that radiotherapy contributed to the decrease of cyst activity.</p><p>It has been reported that liver hydatid disease contributes to the upregulation of TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 expressions in the host [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. The expressions of TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 in the liver were also shown to increase after irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. In this study, the TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 expressions were significantly higher in the liver tissue adjacent to the irradiated cysts compared with the non-irradiated liver tissue, indicating cystic infection and radiotherapy promoted the liver injury pathway mediated by TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10. Meanwhile, slight expressions of TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 were identified in the liver without cysts nearby, demonstrating a tendency for the host affected by <italic>E. granulosus</italic> to develop liver fibrosis. Furthermore, the expressions of TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 in the cystic wall obviously decreased after irradiation, indicating that irradiation contributes to the attenuation of the inflammatory reaction and infection in the host.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. Currently, surgery and chemotherapy are commonly used for the management of hydatid disease. In the present study, we could not compare the efficiency of radiotherapy and that of chemotherapy in this study. In the future, we will focus on conducting a comparison between these treatments in order to further investigate the efficiency of radiotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study was the first to investigate the efficacy and safety of radiotherapy on sheep naturally infected by <italic>E. granulosus</italic>, taking into account CT scans, pathology, and molecular biology.
