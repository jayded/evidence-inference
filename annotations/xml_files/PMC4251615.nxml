The current 1-year study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of arformoterol and provides reassurance that LABAs do not increase the risk of exacerbations or respiratory death in patients with COPD.</p><p>Study strengths include a large patient cohort with long-term treatment data. Importantly, 1-year efficacy data for pulmonary function measures provide additional information on the effects of nebulized bronchodilator treatment against a background of naturally declining lung function. A noninferiority statistical design was used; however, arformoterol was superior to placebo based on an upper bound of the HR (90% RCI) point estimate of 0.606 (0.425, 0.864) being &#x0003c; 1.0 (null value of no treatment difference). Sensitivity analyses assessing the impact of treatment follow-up, important protocol deviations, and baseline covariates support the primary analysis that arformoterol did not increase the risk of respiratory death or COPD exacerbation-related hospitalizations vs placebo during 1 year of treatment.</p><p>There were several study limitations. There was a low baseline exacerbation rate of about one COPD exacerbation in the prior year (low-moderate risk). It is unclear what effect a lower baseline exacerbation rate would have on study outcomes. However, because sample size was driven by the number of primary events observed, the likely impact was only on the number of patients needed for enrollment. Other baseline characteristics (including percent-predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> of about 40%) indicate a population with fairly severe disease (based on GOLD [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease] guidelines in effect at study initiation). If patients in the current study were reassessed using the current GOLD evaluation criteria (eg, symptoms, exacerbation history, and exacerbation rates at baseline), one would expect a more complete picture of exacerbation risk, but not necessarily of mortality risk. There were also a high number of patient withdrawals from treatment (but not withdrawals from study). Forty-five percent of patients discontinued arformoterol (39.3%) and placebo (49.9%) during the study; however, among 841 randomized patients, only 89 (10.6%; 42 arformoterol, 47 placebo) were not followed for 1 year. The discontinuation rate is comparable to, albeit at the higher end of, the range observed in other long-term COPD studies (27%-44%).<sup><xref rid="r28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02010;<xref rid="r30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> Patient-initiated discontinuation was more common with placebo than arformoterol (a finding that may be related to lack of efficacy, as has been discussed previously<sup><xref rid="r32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup>), although this was not assessed as an independent reason for withdrawal. Discontinuations occurred primarily during the first 3 months of treatment.</p><p>The effect of discontinuations on incidence of primary events was assessed in a sensitivity analysis (<inline-supplementary-material xlink:href="chest_146_6_1531_ds01.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e2160" content-type="local-data">e-Table 3</inline-supplementary-material>). Specifically, how many events would need to occur in patients who discontinued vs patients who completed the trial to overturn the findings for superiority and noninferiority of arformoterol? The incidence of the primary end point would have to be fivefold higher (about 50% vs about 10%) in arformoterol dropouts than in completers to overturn the superiority finding, and &#x0003e; 20-fold higher to overturn the noninferiority finding. We believe that this analysis provides reassurance that the number of discontinuations postrandomization in this study would not affect our conclusions.</p><p>In conclusion, this long-term safety study demonstrates that arformoterol did not increase the risk of respiratory death or COPD exacerbation-related hospitalizations vs placebo during 1 year of treatment. These results are consistent with findings in the 3-year TORCH study that demonstrated the long-term safety of LABAs in patients with COPD.<sup><xref rid="r29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> In addition, patients receiving arformoterol experienced improvements in lung function and QoL measures vs patients receiving placebo.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="s1"><caption><p>Online Supplement</p></caption><media xlink:href="chest_146_6_1531_ds01.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p content-type="con"><bold>Author contributions:</bold> J.
