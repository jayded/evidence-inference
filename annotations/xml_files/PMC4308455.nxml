This study was aimed to explore the feasibility of tailored antiplatelet therapy according to the responsiveness to clopidogrel.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>A total of 305 clopidogrel na&#x000ef;ve patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing coronary stenting were randomly assigned to receive standard (<italic>n</italic> = 151) or tailored (<italic>n</italic> = 154) antiplatelet therapy. The ADP-induced platelet aggregation tests by light transmission aggregometry were performed to identify LRC patients assigned to the tailored group. The standard antiplatelet regimen was dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel. The tailored antiplatelet therapy was standard regimen for non-LRC patients and an additional 6-month cilostazol treatment for LRC patients. The primary efficacy outcome was the composite of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke at one year.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>LCR was present in 26.6% (41/154) of patients in the tailored group.

Blood was centrifuged (200 r/min, 10 min) to obtain platelet-rich plasma (PRP). The platelet count in the PRP was adjusted to the range of 150,000 to 300,000 platelets/L by dilution with autologous plasma when out of range. The remaining specimen was re-centrifuged (1500 r/min, 15 min) to obtain platelet-poor plasma (PPP). Platelets were stimulated with 20 &#x000b5;mol/L adenosine diphosphate (ADP). Aggregation was measured at 37&#x000b0;C with a PACKS-4 Aggregometer (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, Texas) and expressed as the maximal percentage change in light transmittance from baseline to 5 min after the addition of the agonist, with PPP as a reference. The percentage of inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) was defined as an absolute reduction of platelet aggregation at T1 compared to T0. An IPA &#x0003c; 10% was defined as LRC.<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref></p></sec><sec id="s2e"><label>2.5</label><title>Study end points, definitions and follow-up</title><p>The primary outcome was the composite occurrence of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke at one year.

TVR was defined as clinically driven PCI or bypass surgery of the target lesion or any segment of the epicardial coronary artery containing the target lesion. Stent thrombosis was defined as angiographically documented stent thrombosis, target vessel-related MI without clear evidence of thrombosis, or unexplained sudden death after index procedure. Hemorrhagic events were classified as major (a drop in hemoglobin of &#x0003e; 50 g/L or any intracranial bleeding), minor (a drop in hemoglobin of 30 g/L to 50 g/L) and minimal (a drop in hemoglobin of &#x0003c; 30 g/L) according to thrombolysis in the myocardial infarction (TIMI) definition.<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> All of the end points were measured and judged by two experienced physicians who were blinded to both the objectives and protocol of this study as well as the patient allocations.</p><p>Clinical follow-ups were performed at 30, 180 and 360 days after index procedure via the clinic, re-hospitalization, or a telephone call.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><label>2.6</label><title>Cost analysis</title><p>All costs of major tests, therapies, and hospital stays related to primary and secondary events were recorded.

Although the advantages of individually tailored antiplatelet therapy compared with standard antiplatelet therapy were not fully demonstrated in this feasibility study, it provides the rationale for further investigations to evaluate whether optimizing an antiplatelet strategy with adjunctive cilostazol can cost-effectively improve long-term outcomes for patients with ACS undergoing PCI.</p><p>Platelet inhibition by standard clopidogrel dose reveals response variability when monitored by <italic>in vitro</italic> platelet function assays. According to previous studies, laboratory results indicated that LRC is associated with increased risks of ischemic cardiovascular events in patients with ACS or undergoing PCI, which strongly imply the rationality of an individually tailored antiplatelet strategy according to treatment response.<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>,<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> In recent years, genetic factors, such as cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2C19*2 variant, are considered relevant to impaired platelet inhibition by clopidogrel. However, studies reported that genetic factors attribute only 10%&#x02013;20% of reduced clopidogrel response.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> In the present study, the LRC rate (26.6%) was lower than the frequency of CYP2C19*2 polymorphisms in Asian patients (40%&#x02013;50%),<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> which is in consist with another study, did not suggest that genotyping alone can replace phenotyping of platelet function.<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref></p><p>Over the past years, diverse devices and methods have been developed to determine whether patients had responded well to antiplatelet therapy. In the present study, LTA was used to assess platelet aggregation. Although this classic method was cost saving and well correlated to clinical events, it was time consuming and inconvenient for large scale population screening. As shown in the present study, about half of the eligible patients were excluded from this procedure because of an inability to obtain baseline platelet aggregation test results, mainly due to prior chronic clopidogrel treatment or logistic problems, such as admission at an off-duty time. Therefore, an immediately available platelet reactivity assay by LTA or other point-of-care devices, such as VerifyNow, may be promising alternatives in the daily practice for screening LRC patients.<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>,<xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref></p><p>For clopidogrel low or non-responders, both enhancing clopidogrel dosage and adding a non-thienopyridine antiplatelet agent (e.g., GP II b/IIIa receptor inhibitors or cilostazol) have been proven effective in reducing the risk of ischemic events.<xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> However, most of those clinical studies were limited by relatively small sample size and were focused on short-term outcomes, typically 30-day clinical or laboratory results. Recently published randomized trials with large sample sizes, including GRAVITAS and ARCTIC trials, also failed to test the efficacy of tailored antiplatelet therapy with double dose clopidogrel or new P2Y12 receptor inhibitors (prasugrel and ticagrelor).<xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> Cilostazol, a selective phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitor, was previously reported to attenuate clopidogrel resistance since its antiplatelet mechanism is quite different.<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> In the randomized ACCEL-RESISTANCE trial, adjunctive cilostazol was shown to be more potent in reducing the rate of high post-treatment platelet reactivity than a high maintenance dose of clopidogrel at 150 mg/d.<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref> In the present study, adjunctive cilostazol therapy for LRC patients induced significant decreases in platelet aggregation by the third day and a non-significant 37% relative risk reduction of primary events at one year. These results coincided with our previous study, which suggest a potential role of cilostazol in personalized antiplatelet therapy.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> The CILON-T trial, including about 40% of stable patients, had demonstrated that the additional cilostazol treatment in real world patient populations can significantly lower platelet reactivity compared with standard dual antiplate-let therapy. However, the improvements of laboratorial results did not bring any clinical benefits, which may be due to the different composition of patients between the present study and CILON-T study.<xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref></p><p>Although additional agents or dosage on the basis of routine antiplatelet therapy have proven more effective in attenuating LRC, unselected use of such regimens was not cost effective. According to the subgroup analysis of our previous study, clinically assessed or angiographically determined high risk patients have benefited the most from the triple antiplatelet therapy of cilostazol, clopidogrel and aspirin.<xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> An individually tailored antiplatelet strategy seems more cost saving than unselected use of intensive antiplatelet therapy in overall cohorts, but the incremental cost of the laboratory tests makes this uncertain, especially if the screening tests are expensive or have a high false-positive rate. Unfortunately, these aspects were ignored by most of the optimizing antiplatelet trials. In the present study, we roughly checked the cost outcomes of LTA screening based optimizing antiplatelet strategy. The results showed that, even with six months cilostazol treatment, the overall incremental costs of tailored antiplatelet therapy were acceptable, which provided more evidence for further investigation.</p><p>A few limitations of the present study must be addressed. Firstly, although the study was a prospective randomized trial, the randomization was open-labeled, and the study was performed at a single center. A multicenter double-blind randomization protocol may provide a more scientific assessment of the efficacy and safety of the tailored antiplatelet strategy. Secondly, because it was a feasibility study, the sample size of the present study was too small to detect the differences of primary endpoint between two strategies. The results of this study therefore need confirmation through clinical trials with larger sample sizes. Thirdly, the lack of stratifying patients based on the high on-treatment platelet reactivity may overestimate the risk of LRC.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The study was supported by National Key Technology R&#x00026;D Program in the 12<sup>th</sup> Five-year Plan of China (2011BAI11B07).</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
