Researchers have recently catalogued the meanings of chimpanzee gestures, but little is known about the gesture meanings of our other closest living relative, the bonobo. The bonobo gestural repertoire overlaps by approximately 90% with that of the chimpanzee, but such overlap might not extend to meanings. Here, we first determine the meanings of bonobo gestures by analysing the outcomes of gesturing that apparently satisfy the signaller. Around half of bonobo gestures have a single meaning, while half are more ambiguous. Moreover, all but 1 gesture type have distinct meanings, achieving a different distribution of intended meanings to the average distribution for all gesture types. We then employ a randomisation procedure in a novel way to test the likelihood that the observed between-species overlap in the assignment of meanings to gestures would arise by chance under a set of different constraints. We compare a matrix of the meanings of bonobo gestures with a matrix for those of chimpanzees against 10,000 randomised iterations of matrices constrained to the original data at 4 different levels. We find that the similarity between the 2 species is much greater than would be expected by chance. Bonobos and chimpanzees share not only the physical form of the gestures but also many gesture meanings.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author summary</title><p>Bonobos and chimpanzees are closely related members of the great ape family, and both species use gestures to communicate. We are able to deduce the meaning of great ape gestures by looking at the &#x02018;Apparently Satisfactory Outcome&#x02019; (ASO), which reflects how the recipient of the gesture reacts and whether their reaction satisfies the signaller; satisfaction is shown by the signaller ceasing to produce more gestures. Here, we use ASOs to define the meaning of bonobo gestures, most of which are used to start or stop social interactions such as grooming, travelling, or sex. We then compare the meanings of bonobo gestures with those of chimpanzees and find that many of the gestures share the same meanings. Bonobos and chimpanzees could, in principle, understand one another&#x02019;s gestures; however, more research is necessary to determine how such gestures and gesture meanings are acquired.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>JSPS Core-to-Core Program <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-core_to_core/">http://www.jsps.go.jp/english/e-core_to_core/</ext-link> (grant number 2012-2014, 2015-2017).

First, there is the question of whether animal signals can be said to have &#x02018;meanings&#x02019; or merely &#x02018;functions&#x02019;. Functions are known for many animal signals: for example, various species are able to decode complex information from their conspecifics&#x02019; calls on the location or class of food or predators [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], level of risk [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], and size of predator [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. However, for meaning, a signal needs to be produced intentionally&#x02014;the signaller must aim to change the behaviour (first-order intentional) or the mental state (at least second-order intentional) of the recipient [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Mounting evidence shows that, unlike most nonhuman animals [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], great apes habitually engage in first-order intentional communication: great apes routinely direct their gestures towards a specific recipient; monitor that recipient&#x02019;s attentional state and choose gestures appropriate to it; wait for the recipient to respond; and, if the recipient does not respond, they persist and elaborate with further gestures [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. These criteria demonstrate that the signaller has a specific outcome in mind and uses gestures to achieve that outcome [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. It has also been argued that to have meaning, communication needs to be ostensive, drawing attention to the fact that it is being used to communicate [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In developmental psychology, eye gaze is taken as an ostensive cue; the audience checking performed by great apes before gesturing serves the same ostensive function [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Because great apes deploy gestures intentionally, it is appropriate to go beyond simply describing their function and enquire about the intended meaning that a signaller aims to achieve by gesturing [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Although we focus on gestural communication, it should be noted that great apes also appear to deploy some vocal signals intentionally [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Moreover, we focus on a Gricean approach to meaning, rather than a semantic approach [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], given that few great ape gestures appear to be referential (but see [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]).</p><p>The second challenge is that gesture meanings must be deduced indirectly. Past studies have tackled the issue of meaning by looking at the context in which gestures occur [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], thereby showing that the same gesture may occur in several contexts. We have taken a different approach. By using the reaction that each gesture elicits, but only in cases where the signaller&#x02019;s behaviour indicates that this reaction was their intended aim, we hope to pin down the signaller&#x02019;s intended meaning for each specific gesture. The meaning of a gesture can thus be defined by the &#x02018;Apparently Satisfactory Outcome&#x02019; (ASO), the reaction of the recipient that satisfies the signaller as shown by cessation of gesturing [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. This method indicates the individual signaller&#x02019;s intended meaning in each instance, and across many instances and individuals, one can examine the gesture&#x02019;s general meaning(s) in a population. Aggregating the meanings represents population level patterns of meaning but does not infer that meanings are conventionalised nor indeed does it imply any particular ontogeny for gesture meanings.</p><p>Defining meaning by ASOs, wild chimpanzees use their gestures to achieve at least 19 ASOs; that is, their gestures achieve 19 types of behavioural response from the recipient [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Each gesture type has a distinct (set of) meaning(s) that is calculated by comparing the distribution of meanings for a gesture type to the distribution of meanings across all gesture types [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Using ASOs to define the meaning of gestures is a relatively new approach, so gesture meanings have not yet been defined for our other closest living relative&#x02014;the bonobo (or &#x02018;bilia&#x02019;, as the species is locally known) [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Our study is the first to investigate meaning in the natural gestural repertoire of wild bonobos.</p><p>Once the meanings of bonobo gestures are defined, we can examine the gestural overlap of bonobos and chimpanzees. All species of nonhuman great ape share the majority of their gestural repertoire in terms of the gestures&#x02019; physical forms. The overlap for chimpanzees and bonobos is 88%&#x02013;96% [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]; for chimpanzees and gorillas, 60% [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]; and for chimpanzees and orangutans, 80% [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. But simply using the same actions does not mean that chimpanzees and bonobos share a communication system (that is, that a chimpanzee and bonobo would in principle be able to understand one another). Only if bonobo and chimpanzee gestures share the same meanings can they be said to share the same system of communication.</p><p>Deciding that issue is not straightforward. Ape gestural repertoires are large, with over 70 distinct gestures in the chimpanzee and bonobo catalogues. In captivity, large quantities of gestural data can be collected very quickly, but the majority of it occurs during play [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Data from the wild are needed to examine the full breadth of meaning expressed in nonplayful ape communication. Previous studies have used traditional analyses of variance or goodness of fit tests, demonstrating that different individuals within a chimpanzee group use the same gesture to achieve the same outcome [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, despite data sets containing thousands of gesture cases, large repertoires and the regular use of only a subset of these gestures [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] limits the number of gesture types that can be examined in this way. Furthermore, those tests are not suited to data sets in which many of the possible outcomes never occur for each signal type, as we would expect in a system of communication in which specific signals are employed for specific outcomes. We have therefore adapted methods from numerical ecology to compare the similarity between the meanings of bonobo and chimpanzee gestures. In doing so, we offer the first analysis that examines whether the overlap in the physical form of bonobo and chimpanzee gestures extends to their meaning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec002"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Bonobo gesture meanings</title><p>We analysed 2,321 intentional gesture instances (occasions on which a gesture was used) that successfully achieved an ASO.

The first 12 of these ASOs served to initiate or develop an activity, and the last 2 served to stop an activity.

They use gestures to request things (such as food) and to initiate co-locomotion, grooming, and sex. Because the gestures are intentionally produced, meeting widely accepted criteria for intentional communication [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], these outcomes are not only the gestures&#x02019; &#x02018;functions&#x02019;&#x02014;they are their &#x02018;meanings&#x02019; [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Moreover, bonobo gesture types have distinct (sets of) meanings. Almost all gesture types achieve a different distribution of ASOs to the average distribution, showing distinct aims. Object shake, the 1 exception, may have failed to show a distinctive pattern because of its small sample size and because it is primarily used for sex and grooming&#x02014;2 behaviours that numerically dominate bonobo gesture instances and thus contribute substantially to the average distribution. Overall, we conclude that bonobos are using gestures to achieve distinct outcomes, as has also been found for chimpanzees [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. About half of bonobo gestures have only a single meaning, while the others have 2 or more meanings. Words in human language can have a single meaning or polysemous meanings, and this poses no problem for the recipient in deciphering the signaller&#x02019;s intended meaning. Future research (with an expansive enough dataset) can explore how bonobo recipients appear able to correctly interpret the meaning of apparently ambiguous gesture types, perhaps by including analysis of facial expressions, gesture sequences, or local situational context.</p><p>Having catalogued the meanings of bonobo gestures, we then compared them with the meanings of chimpanzee gestures, finding evidence of their similarity. Across 10,000 random permutations of the gesture matrices, we failed to generate a single pair that were more similar than the observed data, implying a negligible probability that such similarity arose by chance. This was the case even under the most conservative constraints, where randomised matrices were generated maintaining the number of assignments in both columns and rows as the original data. Our findings remained robust, with clear similarities found between bonobo and chimpanzee meanings, even with subsets of our main gesture matrices, down to a minimum of just 8 (of the 21 total) gesture types. In the future, researchers would ideally be able to use these methods to compare the meaning of gesture repertoires among a range of primate species, determining whether more closely related species have more similar gesture repertoires.</p><p>The bonobo and chimpanzee gestural repertoires&#x02014;that is, the physical form of the gestures&#x02014;overlap by 88%&#x02013;96% [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. We now know that there is also a large overlap in the intended outcomes achieved by these shared gesture types in bonobos and chimpanzees. Whilst biological inheritance is one possible explanation for this overlap, we recognise that similar gestures and meanings could emerge through another acquisition mechanism, such as ontogenetic ritualization [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] or a version of imitation [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] (but see [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]). Bonobos and chimpanzees also experience similar environmental and anatomical constraints that may restrict the available gestures and desired outcomes. More research is needed to explore the precise mechanism behind the overlap of gesture meanings. It is probable that this pattern of gestures and meanings also applied to the last common ancestor we shared with the 2 <italic>Pan</italic> species. That is, it is likely that the <italic>Pan-Homo</italic> last common ancestor would have been able to use and understand most of the gestures of modern bonobos and chimpanzees; less likely, but not impossible, the elaborate shared <italic>Pan</italic> repertoire could have evolved after divergence from the hominin lineage. If we can now discover whether humans also share or understand these great ape gestures, those 2 possibilities can be resolved [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Doubtless, gestural communication was an important contributor in the evolution of language [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]; but it remains to be seen how gesture as it manifests in nonhuman great apes relates to gesture as it manifests in humans alongside thought and language. Understanding this &#x02018;baseline&#x02019; of gestural communication may better enable us to predict those new meanings that development of protolanguage offered to human-specific ancestors, ultimately resulting in the evolution of language.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="sec007"><title>Subjects</title><p>KEG collected data on 2 neighbouring communities of wild bonobos (E1 group and P group) at Wamba, Luo Scientific Reserve, Democratic Republic of the Congo (00&#x000b0; 10' N, 22&#x000b0; 30' E).

For a gesture to be assigned an ASO, we required that the recipient react to the gesture sequence with an ASO (that is, a response that satisfies the signaller shown by cessation of gesturing). ASO was then the specific outcome by the recipient.</p><p>KEG coded all the bonobo video footage and, to test interobserver reliability, CH coded 100 gesture instances for several of the aforementioned categories: gesture type, audience checking, persistence, and signaller apparently satisfied. We analysed Cohen&#x02019;s kappa for interobserver reliability of these variables giving 0.87 (almost perfect), 0.56 (moderate), 0.70 (substantial), and 0.63 (substantial), respectively. CH coded all of the chimpanzee video footage; interobserver was conducted in their 2011 paper [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], with another experienced coder coding 50 gesture instances for directedness, recipient attentional state, and gesture type (Cohen&#x02019;s kappa: directedness, &#x003ba; = 0.69 [substantial]; recipient attentional state, &#x003ba; = 0.63 [substantial]; gesture type, &#x003ba; = 0.86 [almost perfect]).</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Analysis of bonobo gesture meaning</title><p>We recorded 4,256 intentionally produced gesture instances for wild bonobos, but we only analysed the 2,463 gesture instances (including those in sequences) that successfully achieved an ASO. We then excluded gestures used in play (231 instances), because including cases where gestures were used playfully would risk masking their normal meaning&#x02014;the very nature of play means that gestures would be used playfully, not necessarily containing the same meaning they would otherwise. All statistical analyses were conducted in R 3.2.3.</p><p>In accordance with Hobaiter &#x00026; Byrne 2014 [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we used a series of ANOVAs to analyse whether the specific distribution of ASOs for a gesture type differed from the average distribution (the distribution of ASOs across all gesture instances). For direct comparability, we set the same parameters in our analyses to those used in their previous study [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. To be included in parametric analyses, we required that each gesture type achieve an ASO at least 3 times (per individual) by at least 3 individuals (we analysed 1,896 gesture instances; 15 gesture types were suitable for this analysis, and 51 individuals contributed data). Then, we converted the number of instances a gesture type achieved any 1 ASO into a proportion of the total number of gesture instances in which an individual used that gesture type. We also calculated the average distribution by converting the number of instances in which all gesture instances achieved each ASO into a proportion of the total number of gesture instances. For values of 0 or 1, we converted them in accordance with Snedecor and Cochran (0 &#x02192; 1/(4N) and 1 &#x02192; 1-(1/(4N)), where N is the total number of instances for that gesture type) [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Finally, to calculate how the specific distribution deviated from the average distribution, we subtracted the average from the specific distribution. We then conducted the ANOVA with this resulting deviation as the dependent variable, ASO as the independent variable, and signaller identity as a random effect. <italic>P</italic> values of &#x0003c; 0.05 show that the deviation of the specific from the average distribution is significant.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Randomisation procedure for bonobo&#x02013;chimpanzee comparison</title><p>The relationships between gestures and ASOs for each species were represented as a matrix in which each row corresponded to a possible gesture and each column corresponded to 1 of the possible ASOs. A &#x02018;1&#x02019; in this gesture matrix indicated that the associated gesture was observed to precede the associated ASO in the corresponding species. The criterion for inclusion was that a gesture type must achieve the given ASO at least 2 times and by a minimum of 2 individuals (that is, ape individual A uses it once and ape individual B uses it once). Note that criteria for the previous ANOVA were necessarily strict to meet the requirements for parametric analyses. In comparing the communication of 2 species that differ markedly in social behaviour, it is important not to mistake differences in the frequency of use of signals, which are to be expected, with genuine differences in communication system. To avoid that error, we deliberately adopted a looser criterion so that subtle differences in the bonobo and chimpanzee repertoires could be detected but not confused with spurious differences in usage frequency.</p><p>A &#x02018;0&#x02019; in the matrix indicated that such an association was not observed. In order to deal with the few cases where we had insufficient data for 1 or other species, we defined the possible gestures as the intersection of all gestures used (<italic>n</italic> = 22) and possible ASOs as the intersection of all ASOs observed across both species (m = 11). Thus, the dimensions of the gesture matrices were the same for both species (<italic>n</italic> &#x000d7; m), and each row and column had at least one &#x02018;1&#x02019;. We defined the similarity between 2 gesture matrices simply as the sum of all matching corresponding matrix entries, be they 0 or 1.</p><p>Using a randomisation procedure, we tested the null hypothesis that the similarity between the 2 species would be the same under a random assignment of gestures to ASOs for each species [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To perform the randomisation test, we iteratively generated new gesture matrices for each species by randomly permuting the original gesture matrices and calculating the similarity between the 2 resultant matrices, generating a null distribution for similarity over 10,000 iterations. We used 4 different methods of permutation, each imposing different constraints on the possible matrices that could be generated. The simplest method simply randomly shuffled the values in each matrix without any constraints. The row sum preserve method shuffled the entries in each row of a matrix, thus preserving the number of ASOs assigned to each gesture for each species. The column sum preserve method shuffled the entries in each column, thus preserving the number of gestures allocated to each ASO. Finally, the row and column sum preserve method maintained both the number of gestures allocated to ASOs and ASOs allocated to gestures and was performed using the &#x0201c;tswap&#x0201d; algorithm in the vegan package in R, which implements a swap algorithm to generate new matrices that preserve row and column sums whilst sampling the distribution of possible matrices with equal probability [<xref rid="pbio.2004825.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. From the null distribution of similarity values generated by each method, we calculated a corresponding <italic>P</italic> value as the proportion of iterations of the randomisation procedure in which the resultant similarity score was equal to or exceeded that of the original data.</p><p>We then examined the effects of the available number of observed gestures on the results of our analysis by subsetting our original data to include an incrementally increasing number of gestures, c, from 4 to the maximum 21 available to use. For each gesture count, c, and each iteration, we randomly sampled c gestures (rows) from both species&#x02019; gesture matrices to form the data subset for that iteration. Using this subset of the original data, randomised matrices were generated and the resultant similarity compared to that of the nonrandomised, subsetted matrices. A probability value was calculated as the proportion of iterations in which the randomised subset matrices were of equal or greater similarity than their nonrandomised subset counterparts. This probability value allowed us to test the null hypothesis that the observed similarity was the same as would be expected by chance, given that only c randomly selected gestures were observed. When c = 21, the maximum number of gestures available, any subset was the same as the original matrix, so the randomisation test was equivalent to that described in the main text.</p><p>It should be noted that this randomisation test does not rule out the possibility of another primate species having a more similar gesture&#x02013;ASO matrix to chimpanzees or bonobos than they have to each other, though, to the best of our knowledge, no such data currently exist in order to test this. The procedure simply compares the similarity of the 2 species to the similarity of hypothetical gesture matrices generated under the above set of constraints.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec011"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.2004825.s001"><label>S1 Data</label><caption><title>R code for randomisation procedure.</title><p>(R)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.2004825.s001.R"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.2004825.s002"><label>S2 Data</label><caption><title>Raw data and matrices for bonobo and chimpanzee gesture meanings.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.2004825.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.2004825.s003"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Values for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004825.g001">Fig 1</xref>.</title><p>By gesture type, the ASOs achieved and the number and proportion of instances that each ASO is achieved, ordered by the proportion for which the primary ASO is achieved (largest to smallest).</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.2004825.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pbio.2004825.s004"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Individuals contributing data for ASO analysis.</title><p>Number of individuals in each age and sex category that contributed data to analysis of ASOs for wild bonobos.</p><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pbio.2004825.s004.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors offer thanks to Tetsuya Sakamaki, Wamba Committee for Bonobo Research, and Centre de Recherche en &#x000c9;cologie et Foresterie for supporting fieldwork at Wamba; to Heungjin Ryu and Nahoko Tokuyama for additional video footage; and to Wamba&#x02019;s field assistants for making fieldwork possible.
