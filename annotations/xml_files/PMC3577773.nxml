There are several VEGF isoforms and in humans these include VEGF A&#x02013;D. VEGF-D binds to VEGF receptors 2 and 3 (VEGFR2, VEGFR3), localized on endothelial cell membranes. VEGF-D plays an important role in lymphatic vessel development and regrowth <xref rid="pone.0056199-Tammela1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Several groups have shown that serum VEGF-D levels are elevated in cohorts of sporadic pulmonary lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) patients <xref rid="pone.0056199-Glasgow1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056199-Seyama1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056199-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>.

This protocol was approved by the institutional review boards (IRBs) at all participating institutions (Dana-Farber Cancer Institute IRB, University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center IRB, Connecticut Children&#x02019;s Medical Center IRB, Cincinnati Children&#x02019;s Medical Center IRB, NYU School of Medicine IRB, Loma Linda University IRB). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants. Of 36 enrolled subjects, 28 completed all required clinical imaging and laboratory testing during the 2 year study period. Sufficient serum samples from all time points (baseline, 4, 8, 12, and 24 months) were available from 18 subjects for the VEGF-D analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056199-g001">Figure 1</xref>). All subjects were treated with sirolimus during the first year. During months 12&#x02013;24, there was one subgroup that received no additional sirolimus (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15), and one subgroup that was treated with additional sirolimus (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13). Treatment assignment was not random; this additional sirolimus treatment was offered per a protocol amendment to those individuals who had a partial response or stable disease if the treating study physician felt it was in the best interest of the participant. There were 14 patients who were eligible for sirolimus treatment during year 2 because the others had completed (or almost completed) all 24 months by the time the amendment was approved (see additional details in reference 19. Because a comparison of VEGF-D levels from two groups with different treatments from months 12&#x02013;24 was not part of the original study design, the comparison reported here is an exploratory post-hoc analysis.

At 12 months, the mean dose was 6.7 mg per day. The lowest dose was 1 mg every other day and the highest dose was 24 mg per day.

This study has major limitations due to the small size, non-random assignment of additional sirolimus treatment after month 12, the post-hoc exploratory nature of the study, no corrections for multiple testing, and missing samples (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0056199-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Although this was a post-hoc analysis, it is important to note that there were no major differences in initial tumor size in those that got more or less drug after 12 months. Furthermore, all patients that completed 12 months on study (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;28) had stable disease or a partial response at 12 months so all would have been eligible for additional treatment during months 12&#x02013;24 based on tumor response criteria. Some (14/28) were not eligible because they had completed all or almost all 24 months on study at the time of the protocol amendment that allowed additional treatment during months 12&#x02013;24 months. Of the 14 that were eligible, 13 were offered additional treatment. In the 18 patients with complete VEGF-D data, percent change in tumor size and VEGF-D levels at 12 months is similar between the two groups (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056199.s005">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056199.s006">S2</xref>). Although baseline tumor size was similar in the group with missing 24 month VEGF-D data (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0056199.s007">Table S3</xref>), there was a slightly higher percent decrease in tumor size in that group at 12 months. The impact of the response difference in this group on our 24 month VEGF-D analysis reported here is unknown.</p><p>VEGF-D has been investigated previously primarily in patients with LAM but the underlying mechanism leading to elevated VEGF-D in patients with angiomyolipomas and pulmonary LAM remains unknown. Seyama and colleagues were the first to report elevated VEGF-D levels in a population of 44 women with sporadic LAM <xref rid="pone.0056199-Seyama1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. They also reported a negative correlation between VEGF-D levels and FEV1/FVC. In a study of VEGF-D levels in 111 women with sporadic LAM and 40 healthy controls <xref rid="pone.0056199-Glasgow1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, elevated VEGF-D levels were observed primarily in women with LAM who also had lymphatic involvement, regardless of whether kidney angiomyolipomas were present. They also reported a correlation between VEGF-D levels and CT scan grade for severity of lung disease. Using a grading scale of I (milder disease with cysts involving less than one third of the lung parenchyma) to III (more severe disease with cysts involving more than two thirds of lung parenchyma), they found that VEGF-D levels were higher in women with CT scan grades of II and III compared with those with CT scan grade I (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.033). In 2008, Young and colleagues reported the potential diagnostic utility of VEGF-D levels for women with cystic lung disease of unknown etiology as elevated VEGF-D levels were associated with LAM <xref rid="pone.0056199-Young1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, but not healthy women or women with other lung diseases. In a follow-up prospective study, this group reported that in a cohort of 48 women presenting with cystic lung disease, VEGF-D levels of &#x0003e;800 pg/ml were diagnostically specific for LAM, whereas levels &#x0003c;600 ng/ml were associated with other causes of cystic lung disease <xref rid="pone.0056199-Young2" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. In a phase 3 multicenter trial (MILES Trial) evaluating the efficacy of sirolimus for the treatment of LAM (sporadic and TSC associated), VEGF-D levels were elevated at baseline (2029&#x000b1;2343 pg/ml, all subjects, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;89) and decreased in the group treated with sirolimus for 12 months (862&#x000b1;540 pg/ml, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;41), but not in the placebo group (2444&#x000b1;3862 pg/ml, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;34). The change from baseline for the sirolimus versus the placebo group was significantly different (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.001). A major difference in our study population was that we recruited subjects with kidney angiomyolipomas. Consequently, not all of our subjects had LAM, and those with LAM were likely to have less severe pulmonary disease than in the LAM cohorts used for the VEGF-D studies described above. We did observe higher levels of VEGF-D in TSC/LAM patients (compared with TSC only patients) and women (versus men), which is similar to findings reported by Young and colleagues (2008).</p><p>Although it is clear that VEGF-D is an interesting biomarker, the mechanism leading to elevated VEGF-D in patients with angiomyolipomas and pulmonary LAM is not currently known. Furthermore, the role of elevated VEGF-D in the development and/or progression of disease is also not understood. It is known that VEGF-D binds the receptor VEGF-R3 and this interaction is important for lymphangiogenesis <xref rid="pone.0056199-Tammela1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. There is some evidence that the interaction between VEGF-D and VEGF-R3 on pulmonary LAM cells may induce proliferation of these abnormal cells in the lung. One group of investigators has shown that VEGF-D stimulates migration and proliferation of LAM derived cells. They also used immunochemistry to show that VEGF-R3 is present on LAM derived cells <xref rid="pone.0056199-Issaka1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. There is some debate about these findings as another group has isolated LAM cell clusters and lymphatic endothelial cells from the chylous effusions of LAM patients and found that VEGF-R3 expression is present on lymphatic endothelial cells but not on LAM cell clusters <xref rid="pone.0056199-Seyama2" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. There have also been reports of solid tumors that express VEGF-R3. However, the reliability of some of these data has been questioned because several antibodies that were used may have been non-specific. Based on an extensive review of the literature and detailed analysis (including northern, FACS, western blotting, RT-PCR, immunoprecipitation and immunohistochemistry) of 62 tumor cell lines and staining of 456 tumor tissues (including 35 histological types), one group reported that expression of VEGF-R3 is negligible in most solid tumor cells when compared to vascular and lymphatic endothelial cells. They concluded that VEGF-R3 expression is restricted to endothelial and lymphatic cells or tumors of blood/lymph origin <xref rid="pone.0056199-Petrova1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Consistent with this conclusion, in a study of 28 malignant melanoma tumor samples, VEGF-D expression was observed in the melanoma tumor cells and both VEGF-D and VEGF-R3 were expressed on nearby endothelial cells <xref rid="pone.0056199-Achen1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Achen and colleagues (2001) also note that this pattern is consistent with a paracrine mechanism in which tumor cells secrete VEGF-D and VEGF-D binds VEGF-R3 expressed on nearby endothelial cells which then internalize the VEGF-D. Interestingly, it has also been reported that elevated VEGF-D in kidney confined renal cell carcinoma was associated with improved disease survival <xref rid="pone.0056199-Klatte1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. There are some intriguing observations regarding VEGF-D and VEGF-R3 expression in solid tumors and LAM cells that may be relevant to our findings in patients with kidney angiomyolipomas, however no definitive mechanism has been confirmed. As there currently are no data available on the expression of VEGF-D or VEGF-R3 in angiomylipomoma tissues or cells, additional studies are needed to understand the importance of VEGF-D/VEGF-R3 interactions relevant to the development and progression of this prominent feature of tuberous sclerosis and sporadic LAM.</p><p>In conclusion, our results show that serum VEGF-D may be useful for monitoring response to treatment with sirolimus and kidney angiomyolipoma size. Because of the study limitations, confirmation of these findings in future randomized studies with larger numbers of TSC patients and longer duration follow-up are needed before this could be recommended for use in a clinical setting. Since TSC is usually diagnosed during childhood and kidney angiomyolipomas are common in children greater than five years of age, future studies that include pediatric subjects would be of clinical importance because there may be the potential to identify individuals at risk for developing problematic kidney angiomyolipomas early in the disease process. If VEGF-D does prove to be useful for monitoring the severity of these tumors, it may allow adequate monitoring with less frequent kidney MRI or other imaging tests. A clear understanding of the mechanism of VEGF-D signaling in the development and progression of kidney angiomyolipomas associated with TSC will require further research.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0056199.s001"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><p>
