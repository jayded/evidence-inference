Currently, 7.2 million individuals aged between 20 and 79&#x000a0;years are affected by T2DM in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. T2DM clinical practice guidelines by the American Diabetes Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] and International Diabetes Federation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] suggest starting treatment with metformin unless contraindicated, followed by the addition of other oral antidiabetic drugs (OADs) if patients fail to achieve glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) goal &#x0003c;7.0%. The Japan Diabetes Society (JDS) suggests starting pharmacotherapy with any OAD depending on the physiological status of the patient after diet and exercise failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Most of the Japanese patients with T2DM have a tendency to a low body mass index (BMI); and as insulin secretion deficiency plays a predominant role in disease pathology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], insulin secretagogues are the preferred first-line treatment option in Japan. Recently, Japanese patients with T2DM are being increasingly treated with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (e.g., vildagliptin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>], which increase insulin secretion from &#x003b2;-cells in a glucose-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Moreover, the progressive nature of the disease warrants treatment intensification with other antidiabetic agents having complementary mechanism of action to maintain glycemic control over long term [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p>The mechanistic synergy between vildagliptin and metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>], and the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin added to metformin in Japanese patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with metformin monotherapy has already been demonstrated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, the benefit of switching patients, who are treated with vildagliptin and require additional treatment, to vildagliptin and metformin has not been established. So far, no DPP-4 inhibitor/metformin single-pill combination (SPC) is available in Japan. Such a SPC has the additional benefit of a reduced pill burden, and potentially better compliance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Moreover, the efficacy of low-dose metformin [250&#x000a0;mg twice daily (bid)] has not been studied previously in a randomized trial setting in Japanese patients with T2DM. Accordingly, the current study was aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin/metformin SPC at doses of 50/250 and 50/500&#x000a0;mg in Japanese patients with T2DM inadequately controlled with diet, exercise and vildagliptin monotherapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This 14-week, multicenter, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, randomized study was conducted across 30 centers in Japan from May 2013 to February 2014.

The goal of the study was to assess the efficacy and safety of vildagliptin/metformin SPC over 14&#x000a0;weeks in Japanese patients with T2DM inadequately controlled by diet, exercise, and vildagliptin monotherapy.</p><p>The present study showed that vildagliptin/metformin SPC is efficacious, safe and well-tolerated in Japanese patients with T2DM. The HbA1c reduction observed with the SPC (&#x02212;0.8%; baseline: 7.9%) in patients inadequately controlled by vildagliptin monotherapy was similar to the earlier reported drop in HbA1c with free-dose combination of vildagliptin/metformin in patients inadequately controlled by metformin monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Almost half of patients treated with vilda/met SPC achieved the JDS recommended glycemic target of HbA1c&#x000a0;&#x0003c;7.0% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] with three-fourths of patients demonstrating a clinically relevant drop in HbA1c (&#x02265;0.5%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], thus, highlighting the benefit of switching patients who are inadequately controlled with vildagliptin monotherapy to the vildagliptin/metformin SPC. The mean reduction in FPG levels was also significantly higher for the vilda/met group compared with the vilda/placebo group, which is consistent with the mechanism of action of metformin to decrease the overnight hepatic glucose production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The data presented here are the first data to establish the clinical efficacy of metformin 250&#x000a0;mg bid in Japanese patients, as such closing an important gap. Even this low metformin dose resulted in clinically relevant glycemic benefit with an HbA1c difference of 0.8% vs. vilda/placebo group.</p><p>The overall incidence of AEs was lower in the vilda/met group compared with the vilda/placebo group. This can be mostly attributed to a higher incidence of mild events of nasopharyngitis, all of which were considered unrelated to the study drug. This is likely a chance finding, given that the only treatment change in this patient was adding placebo treatment to already existing vildagliptin treatment. There were no hypoglycemic events reported in this study, despite the significant improvement in the glycemic control with the SPC, which is consistent with the earlier known safety profile of vildagliptin in Japanese patients with T2DM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] and a potential vildagliptin mediated protective effect against hypoglycemia through enhanced gastric inhibitory polypeptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. There was no weight gain over 14&#x000a0;weeks of treatment in both the groups reconfirming the previously established weight neutrality effect of metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Overall, the safety and tolerability of the vilda/met group were in line with the known safety profile of vildagliptin as a single agent or as a free combination with metformin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Treatment with SPC of vildagliptin/metformin targets the multiple pathophysiological abnormalities of T2DM such as impaired insulin secretion, increased endogenous glucose production, and decreased utilization of glucose, in turn helping patients to maintain good glycemic control. Metformin complements the mechanism of action of vildagliptin by raising absolute levels of glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Furthermore, SPC formulations have advantages such as reduced pill burden, improved convenience and adherence over free-dose combinations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Results from a meta-analysis showed that SPC reduces the risk of non-compliance by 26% compared with the free-dose combination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, robust glucose-lowering efficacy along with good safety and tolerability makes the vildagliptin/metformin SPC an attractive treatment option for Japanese patients with T2DM who require additional treatment beyond vildagliptin monotherapy.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="MOESM1"><media xlink:href="13300_2015_99_MOESM1_ESM.pptx"><caption><p>Supplementary material 1 (PPTX 112 kb)</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, #NCT01811485.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients and staff who participated in this study.
