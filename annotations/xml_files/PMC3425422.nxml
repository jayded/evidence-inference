We thus investigated if meal-induced platelet activation could be attenuated by meal insulin. A randomized, double-blind, cross-over study was performed to compare postprandial platelet activation after premeal injections of placebo or insulin aspart (0.1 and 0.2 units/kg) in 18 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Platelet activation was assessed by flow cytometry, without and with stimulation by the thromboxane analog U46619 or ADP. Measurements were before and after premeal blood glucose standardization (to 6&#x02013;7 mmol/L by insulin infusion, if needed) and at 90 min after the meal. Premeal insulin reduced postprandial hyperglycemia by 2&#x02013;3 mmol/L compared with placebo. Postmeal insulin levels were doubled with placebo and further elevated with insulin injections. The standardized meal enhanced U46619-induced platelet P-selectin expression by 23% after placebo; this response was more than doubled after premeal insulin. U46619-induced fibrinogen binding was unchanged after meal intake with placebo but was markedly enhanced (by &#x0223c;50&#x02013;60%) after premeal insulin. Postprandial platelet activation correlated positively to postprandial insulin levels and inversely to glucose levels. Premeal insulin infusion was also associated with platelet activation. Our results suggest that postprandial insulin rather than glucose accounts for postprandial platelet activation in T2DM patients.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Postprandial hyperglycemia (PPH) is thought to be an independent risk factor for cardiovascular complications in diabetes mellitus (DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>).

Patients were instructed to abstain from food, tobacco, or nicotine on days of the experiment. No blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medication was given in the mornings before experiments. The basal insulin dose was halved the evening before to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia. Patients arrived in the morning and rested in a semireclining position for 30 min, after which baseline blood samples (baseline 1 [B1]) were drawn for platelet function, glucose, and insulin levels. Premeal blood glucose levels were &#x0201c;standardized&#x0201d; to 6&#x02013;7 mmol/L on every occasion by intravenous infusion of insulin aspart, if needed. A second set of blood tests was taken (baseline 2 [B2]) 15 min after the target premeal glucose level was achieved.

However, attenuation of PPH by premeal insulin injections did not result in reduced platelet activation. On the contrary, platelet activation evoked by thromboxane receptor stimulation (U46619) was markedly enhanced after premeal insulin, and a positive correlation was observed between postprandial platelet activation and insulin levels. In support of direct or indirect platelet activating effects of insulin in vivo, we found that insulin infusion to standardize premeal glucose levels was also associated with increased platelet reactivity. These results suggest that postprandial hyperinsulinemia, rather than PPH, causes platelet hyperactivity mediated via pathways stimulated by thromboxane and ADP but not collagen after food intake in patients with T2DM.</p><p>Several studies, including work from our laboratory, have shown that high glucose can increase platelet reactivity via an elevation of osmolality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Our findings of postprandial platelet hyperreactivity in T2DM patients but not in healthy control subjects led us to propose that PPH causes platelet dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In line with this notion, acarbose treatment, which attenuates PPH, reduced the urinary thromboxane metabolite excretion in T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Our present finding challenges the concept that PPH enhances platelet activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>) and indicates that other mechanisms may underlie postprandial platelet hyperactivity in T2DM patients.</p><p>Platelets express insulin and IGF-1 receptors, which may be activated by insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), but the literature on insulin effects on platelet activation is inconsistent. We have found mild platelet-activating effects of insulin at physiologic concentrations (10&#x02013;100 &#x000b5;U/mL [60&#x02013;600 pmol/L]) in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). This is in line with the present in vivo results. However, several laboratories have found platelet-inhibiting effects of higher insulin concentrations (&#x02265;1 nmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>), and platelet-activating effects of very high insulin concentrations (100 nmol/L) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). Others found no direct effects of insulin on platelets in vitro but found inhibitory effects during coincubation with endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). In healthy individuals, insulin appears to suppress platelet activation through inhibition of the P2Y12 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). However, patients with T2DM and even obese insulin-resistant subjects seem to have &#x0201c;platelet insulin resistance&#x0201d; and lose their responsiveness to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In insulin-treated obese T2DM patients, there are increases in collagen- and ADP-induced platelet adhesion and aggregation, and increased phosphatidylserine exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), which is consistent with our observations.</p><p>In the second Diabetes Mellitus Insulin Glucose Infusion in Acute Myocardial Infarction (DIGAMI 2) study, insulin treatment of T2DM patients after a myocardial infarction was associated with an increased risk of myocardial infarction or stroke compared with sulfonylurea treatment, whereas metformin treatment, which increases insulin sensitivity, was associated with a decreased risk compared with sulfonylurea treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). Our findings of platelet activation by insulin in vivo may be relevant in this context. Also of interest are findings of higher platelet activity among T2DM patients receiving dual-antiplatelet treatment who were also treated with insulin compared with those who were not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). The importance of insulin resistance for these findings in T2DM patients and the mechanisms involved in the presently observed meal effects, such as increased oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), deserve further investigation.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that postprandial insulin rather than glucose levels may account for meal-induced platelet hyperactivity in patients with T2DM.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
