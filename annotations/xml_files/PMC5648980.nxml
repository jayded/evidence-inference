Budesonide which is inhaled after nebulization can spread to the whole lung and has a high lung deposition rate; budesonide nebulization has lasting effect and is highly effective to local inflammation; hence, it has been applied in the clinical treatment of bronchopneumonia and bronchial asthma.<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> But the above method lacks support from clinical evidences concerning ventilator associated pneumonia of newborns.

An single-factor analysis<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> suggested that premature infants, low body weight, mechanical ventilation time, primary pulmonary diseases, reintubation and with or without use of large-dose gamma globulin was associated to ventilator-associated pneumonia. Therefore how to effectively prevent and treat neonatal ventilator associated pneumonia has been one of the serious issues in clinical practice.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Glucocorticoids have been applied in clinical treatment as it has strong anti-inflammatory effect and can obviously inhibit inflammation induced by different causes and different stages of immunopathogenesis.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Currently, the effectiveness of budesonide in neonatal treatment has been frequently reported in China and abroad. Mokra et al. found that,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> glucocorticoids can effectively improve the lung function of children with meconium aspiration syndrome, relieve inflammation, and partially avoid the inactivation of lung alveolar surfactant. Luo HJ et al. found budesonide can improve pulmonary ventilation and diffuse function in the treatment of neonatal aspiration pneumonia.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> For premature infants,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> budesonide nebulization can relieve mechanical ventilation induced airway inflammation and prevent the incidence of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.</p><p>The anti-inflammatory effect produced by budesonide nebulization is similar to systemic use of hormone drugs. As the drug can directly produce effect on local sites, the dose needed is smaller, and the coordination of children is also not necessary. Therefore, the longer the duration of nebulization, the higher the drug concentration in the respiratory tract, which makes the treatment effect better than systemic medication. The research results demonstrates that, the mechanical ventilation time, time for recovering from chest X-ray examination and hospitalization of the observation group were shorter than those of the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), which was consistent with the research results of Cao GK et al.<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>; the oxygen index of the observation group had an obvious increase compared to the control group (P&#x0003c;0.05), suggesting budesonide nebulization could effectively relieve pulmonary inflammatory reaction of neonatal ventilator associated pneumonia, shorten mechanical ventilation time and hospitalization time, and improve pulmonary diffusion function.</p><p>The influence of hormones on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is always concerned by both doctors and patients. This study followed up all cured children for half a year. The investigation results demonstrated that, the body development of children in the two groups had no remarkable difference in the 3rd and 6th month (P&#x0003e;0.05), suggesting small-dose budesonide nebulization had a high therapeutic index and high safety and had no adverse effect on the growth and development of children in short time. The cumulative death rate of the observation group was significantly lower than that of the control group in the 6<sup>th</sup> month after treatment, and the difference had statistical significance. The result might be associated with the effective control of levels of inflammatory cytokine and pulmonary infection; however, the specific mechanism remains to be further investigated.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Limitations of the Study</title><p>The sample size is small. Therefore, multi-center clinical randomized control studies are expected to draw conclusions by means of evidence-based medicine or meta-analysis to guide clinical works.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In conclusion, budesonide inhalation treatment is effective in treating neonatal ventilator associated pneumonia.
