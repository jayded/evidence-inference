Cortisol is a catabolic steroid that, in high concentrations, has been reported to interfere with the anabolic processes that promote muscle hypertrophy, which may in turn negatively affect strength development <xref rid="pone.0055051-Daly1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>Growth hormone (GH) and insulin like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) work both synergistically and independently to stimulate many metabolic functions <xref rid="pone.0055051-Mauras1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Growth hormone (GH) is considered to be an anabolic &#x0201c;family of related polypeptides&#x0201d; <xref rid="pone.0055051-Nindl1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref> that stimulates protein synthesis, cell reproduction and renewal.

GH concentrations generally increase in response to both strength and endurance exercise thereby simulating IGF-1 production.</p><p>Serum hormone concentrations are influenced by the availability of hormone transporters and receptors. Sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) has a specific &#x0201c;high-affinity&#x0201d; binding site for transporting sex hormones like testosterone while IGF-1 binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) transports and helps to control the distribution of the majority of IGF-1 in circulation <xref rid="pone.0055051-Clemmons1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. Binding of hormones to proteins/globulins allows for an extended period of transport throughout the body, thus increasing the potential for action.</p><p>It is well established that both strength and endurance exercise can cause acute fatigue resulting in reduced strength and power of loaded muscles. Both maximal and explosive type strength exercises are able to induce acute fatigue; however, the mechanisms behind this fatigue may differ <xref rid="pone.0055051-Linnamo2" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>. An endurance training session does not cause as much fatigue as a strength training session due to the differences in force production. Typical strength exercises require high levels of muscle activation, while endurance training demands lower levels of repetitive force production and even maximal uphill running cannot evoke maximal muscle activation <xref rid="pone.0055051-Sloniger1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>The benefits of strength training for endurance performance has been well documented in recent years (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0055051-Mikkola1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0055051-Storen1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>), though interference has been observed under certain conditions <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hickson1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Studies on the acute responses to combined strength and endurance exercise and the specific role of order are limited. Endurance exercise followed by strength exercise has been shown to influence the magnitude of the testosterone, but not the cortisol response in strength trained men <xref rid="pone.0055051-Cadore1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>; however, the acute hormone responses to strength and endurance training in a combined session and changes in concentrations during the subsequent recovery have not yet been illuminated.

Subjects received written and oral information about the study design and measurement procedures. The possible risks and benefits of participation in the study were thoroughly explained prior to signing two copies of an informed consent document (one for the subjects&#x02019; records and the other for our records). A resting electrocardiogram and health history questionnaires filled out by each subject were reviewed and approved by a physician prior to participation in the study.</p><p>Prior to the specific loading sessions, subjects completed a set of tests to familiarize themselves with the strength training equipment and to determine appropriated loads/intensities for the specific loadings. Measurements included: maximal isometric bilateral leg extension force and rate of force development as well as maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2max</sub>). Body composition and baseline resting blood samples for serum hormones were also measured. Following completion of these baseline tests, subjects performed, in random order, two loadings of strength and endurance exercise (ES or SE) which were completed in a single session. Approximately one to three weeks separated pre-testing and loadings. Time of day variations in force and hormonal variables were controlled for by making sure that each subject performed loadings &#x000b1;1 hour from their pre-testing time and by taking blood samples in the morning (in a rested and fasted state) on each testing day.</p><sec id="s2b1"><title>The strength loading</title><p>focused primarily on the leg extensors and included both maximal and explosive strength exercises.

Explosive strength exercises included three sets of 8&#x02013;10 repetitions with maximal velocity of each repetition using 30&#x02013;40% 1RM load. Exercises included: maximal bilateral leg press (3 sets maximal and 3 sets explosive), squat (3 sets maximal), loaded squat jump (3 sets explosive), and calf raises (2 sets maximal). Strength exercises were performed in a circuit such that leg press exercises were at the beginning, middle and end of the training session. There was 2 minutes of rest between sets.

In men, serum cortisol (C) response was significantly greater in SE than ES at post loading while testosterone concentrations during the present loadings (pre-post) remained relatively stable. At 24 h and 48 h of recovery, however, serum testosterone (T) concentrations in SE men were significantly lower than at baseline while also being lower than those of ES men at 24 h and 48 h. Significant differences in serum growth hormone (GH) responses of men were observed at post loading with concentrations remaining higher in SE despite the initial response to the first part of both ES and SE loadings being the same at mid. In women, a significant increase was observed in T at post SE whereas GH responses, though smaller, paralleled those of the men. Fatigue, as measured by maximal and explosive force, was the same in SE and ES post loading, but greater in men than in women. These responses suggest that performing strength training prior to endurance training is a more potent stimulus for hormonal responses, especially in men, than performing endurance training prior to strength training. The different responses to ES and SE loadings suggest that the order of exercises in single-session combined strength and endurance training should be considered even in recreational athletes because these responses may ultimately have physiological relevance in optimizing training.</p><p>The overall cumulative neuromuscular fatigue resulting from the present combined loadings was the same in SE and ES post loading, but fatigue was greater in men than in women. Both maximal isometric strength (MVC) and rate of force development (RFD) were significantly decreased at post, but appeared to recover at a similar rate following the loadings, despite remaining significantly decreased in men at 24 h and 48 h. Muscle activation was not examined in this study, thus it is unknown if, and to what extent, central fatigue along with the observed peripheral fatigue, may have been a factor. Nevertheless, based on previous research we can assume that maximal muscle activation decreased along with maximal strength <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen3" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. While decreased force production is used as an indicator of fatigue, the time-course of these responses may be different from those observed in serum hormone concentrations that are used as biomarkers to assess physiological stress. In this investigation, primarily T, C, and GH seemed to be affected by order of exercise, whereas insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), insulin-like growth factor 1 binding protein 3 (IGF-BP3) and sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) appeared to behave similarly regardless of the order of exercise.</p><p>An acute increase in T concentrations is a typical observation following a strength training session that has been linked to strength development and muscle growth after training (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-Ahtiainen1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>). In the present study, the T response in men was similar from pre to post in ES and SE, while in women a difference in the magnitude of change in T concentrations was observed at post ES and SE with a greater increase occurring following SE. In men, the T responses in ES and SE differed significantly during recovery at 24 h and 48 h post loading with relative T concentrations being lower on both days in SE than in ES. In women, T concentrations were similar at 24 h and 48 h of recovery. It appears that while voluntary force returned to baseline, serum hormone concentrations continued to respond to the exercise stimulus. In some studies, T has fully recovered after 1&#x02013;2 days of rest <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen4" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-McCaulley1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> whereas in other studies with very stressful resistance loading conditions, T levels remained decreased even after 2 days of rest <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen5" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This decreased T concentration may indicate that the hormone is being used for physiological processes or may be suggestive of the presence of a protein catabolic state <xref rid="pone.0055051-Adlercreutz1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, which may be undesirable should it persist for several days. It should be noted, however, that the decreased T observed in the present study was not accompanied by significantly elevated cortisol during recovery. Serum C concentrations in men were similar at mid ES and SE loadings, but significantly different at post, with a greater concentration of C observed in SE. Like other studies, the changes in C concentrations paralleled those observed in GH concentrations <xref rid="pone.0055051-Viru1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In women, there were no differences between ES and SE in terms of C behavior, but C was observed to decrease during the loading, a finding similar to Copeland et al. 2002 <xref rid="pone.0055051-Copeland1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref> who examined separate strength and endurance loadings in women. Recovery of C at 24 h and 48 h was complete in both loadings in men and women. As C plays an important role in activation of cascades leading to mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle <xref rid="pone.0055051-Goffart1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, the greater magnitude of increase in C observed in SE of men and similar increase in women could, if it occurs with repeated training, be of physiological significance.</p><p>Previous studies have indicated that the magnitude of GH response is greater in &#x0201c;more fatiguing&#x0201d; strength training sessions <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen6" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref> and amplified with repeated exercise bouts of strength training <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kanaley1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>. This response is of interest because the initial GH response in this study following E and S at mid in men was the same, whereas GH concentrations decreased significantly when E was followed by S (ES) and remained elevated when S was followed by E (SE) at post. Strikingly similar responses were observed in GH response by Goto et al. 2005 <xref rid="pone.0055051-Goto1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref> who examined the effects of a 60 minute low-intensity cycling protocol on a strength training session designed to induce pronounced hormonal responses <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen7" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>. In women GH responses were minimal, and recovery to baseline was complete in both men and women by 24 h. The reason behind the continued elevation in GH of men during the SE loading is difficult to explain, but may be linked to previous observations that GH concentrations begin to increase at the start of aerobic exercise with peak concentrations at or close to the end of aerobic exercise (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0055051-Weltman1" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>). The decrease in GH concentrations observed after mid in ES may be explained, in part, by the same phenomena because aerobic exercise was stopped and the overall intensity of the present strength loading was relatively low. It is important to remember that the present strength loading was made up of both maximal and explosive exercises, and included several periods of rest between each set of exercises. Lower volume strength and power loadings are known to induce a smaller hormone response than high volume loadings with short periods of rest <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer4" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. As the GH variant examined in this study was the commonly examined and most abundant of GH variants (22 kDa variant), it is important to acknowledge that other GH variants may have responded differently and that it is necessary to exercise some caution when interpreting these results. It seems, however, reasonable to suggest that the extended period of GH elevation induced by SE may have physiological significance should it be present during repeated SE training sessions.</p><p>No differences were observed between ES and SE in IGF-1 responses and responses in men and women were not significantly different, these findings are parallel with Copeland et al. 2002 (women with 30 min recovery) <xref rid="pone.0055051-Copeland1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. IGF-1 and IGF-BP3 behaved similarly in ES and SE loadings and recovery in both men and women with a significant difference in magnitude of change observed only at post ES between men and women. SHBG was statistically unaltered during the loadings with no differences in responses observed between men and women. Our results parallel those of previous studies in which IGF-I levels were not affected in the 2 days following the loading protocols despite an increase in GH in men <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>.</p><p>The difference observed between the acute responses of GH and IGF-1 supports the idea that these hormones work independently in response to exercise stress <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer2" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. As blood samples were only taken post loading and some of the hormones e.g. GH are secreted in a pulsatile manner, we were unable to determine if there were further responses in the hours immediately after a training session as has been observed in other studies (e.g. <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer3" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>). In previous studies, however, GH concentrations appear to stabilize 1&#x02013;2 hours after fatiguing heavy-resistance protocols <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen5" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>.</p><p>Concentrations of serum hormones measured in the morning also appeared to be affected by loadings. In men, a significant decrease in T from baseline was observed after SE at 24 h-AM. The difference between ES and SE concentrations at this time point was significant and similar to that observed when examining corresponding time of day hormonal concentrations. These parallel changes in morning and time of day concentrations of T indicate that the SE exercise stimulus produced a greater stress response than ES and they correspond to findings that T may not fully return to resting values after training that induces physiological stress <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen5" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. As testosterone levels typically increase overnight, this observation suggests that pituitary-testicular action was indeed suppressed. Following SE in women, a significant increase in morning C concentration was observed between 24 h-AM and 48 h-AM while a significant decrease in morning C concentration was observed in ES of women between 24 h-AM and 48 h-AM resulting in a significant difference between ES and SE, a finding that does not parallel time of day concentrations. This delayed C response could indicate that women did not recover completely from SE within the two days of rest examined.</p><p>The magnitudes of hormonal responses in women observed in the present study were somewhat smaller than those observed in men. This response was expected, as numerous studies have previously shown that hormonal responses in women are typically more subtle than in men <xref rid="pone.0055051-Linnamo1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen7" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen8" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer5" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>. When studying women it is natural to contemplate the potential influence of different phases of the menstrual cycle, however, it appears that e.g. pituitary-adrenal responses to short-term, moderate intensity exercise are not significantly influenced by the menstrual cycle phase <xref rid="pone.0055051-Galliven1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>. When examining acute hormonal responses to exercise in both men and women, circadian rhythms should also be taken into account. Previous studies have shown a substantial decrease in e.g. testosterone concentrations in the morning between 04&#x02236;00 and 08&#x02236;00 and a more gradual decrease from 08&#x02236;00 until 22&#x02236;00 <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer6" ref-type="bibr">[46]</xref>, while others have shown evidence that cortisol is affected by diurnal variations in both young men and women <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen7" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kanaley2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. These diurnal variations, including nocturnal responses, may conceal some physiological responses as H&#x000e4;kkinen et al. <xref rid="pone.0055051-Hkkinen7" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref> has postulated, on the other hand, e.g. the magnitude of growth hormone response to exercise appears to be independent of time of day <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kanaley2" ref-type="bibr">[47]</xref>. In addition to diurnal variations, nutrition, overtraining/excessive fatigue and stress <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> as well as individual training status <xref rid="pone.0055051-Kraemer7" ref-type="bibr">[48]</xref> can contribute to hormonal changes reported in studies. Taking this into consideration, the present study included a fairly homogenous group in terms of training status as well as specific instructions for subjects on how to prepare for each loading to minimize possible confounding factors. As the above factors have been taken into consideration, it may be suggested that the observed changes and differences in serum concentrations of hormones, though small, may have a dynamic role in subsequent physiological processes and training adaptations. In fact, there is some evidence that performing endurance training prior to strength training (ES) is more effective in improving endurance performance characteristics than SE training and E and S performed alone <xref rid="pone.0055051-Chtara1" ref-type="bibr">[49]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0055051-Bell1" ref-type="bibr">[50]</xref>, whereas intrasession sequence of E and S training may not influence adaptations in muscle strength and power <xref rid="pone.0055051-Chtara2" ref-type="bibr">[51]</xref>.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Both of the present combined (ES and SE) loadings led to more fatigue in men than in women in maximal bilateral isometric strength and isometric rate of force development was affected only in men, though to a smaller degree. In men, neuromuscular fatigue was accompanied by an increase in cortisol concentrations observed at post in SE, which was followed by decreased concentrations of testosterone in SE at 24 h and 48 h post loading. Despite the initial response to the first part of both ES and SE loadings being the same at mid, GH response in men was also observed to be different with concentrations remaining higher at post in SE. These observed differences in hormonal responses in men regardless of similarities in neuromuscular fatigue indicate the presence of an order effect. Acute hormonal responses in men in general were greater than in women. An order effect was also observed in women as a significant difference in testosterone between ES and SE loadings was observed at post, while no changes or order effect was observed during recovery. Although a great decrease in maximal strength was observed post loading in both SE and ES of men and women, there was no order effect observed in neuromuscular measures of either maximal or explosive strength. The present study does, however, demonstrate an order effect in hormone responses, particularly in T of men that indicated that the body may not have been fully recovered 24 h and 48 h following SE. The time-course of neuromuscular fatigue and recovery appears not to match the time-course of serum hormone responses to ES and SE loadings and an order effect appears to be present when combining strength and endurance training into a single session. These findings may be utilized in order to optimize training.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>This study was completed at the Department of Biology of Physical Activity at the University of Jyv&#x000e4;skyl&#x000e4; (JYU) with assistance from the Research Institute for Olympic Sport (KIHU).
