When sinusitis lasts longer, for more than 12 weeks, this condition is known as chronic sinusitis.</p><p>Chronic inflammation of the sinus mucosa is a common ailment in which the maxillary sinus is mostly involved. Chronic sinusitis is usually the result of incompletely resolved acute sinusitis. Clinical features of chronic sinusitis are nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, tendency to clear one's throat frequently, abnormalities of smell, epistaxis, dryness of throat, sore throat, headache, sense of tiredness, low-grade fever, feeling of being unwell, gastrointestinal discomfort, chronic bronchitis, excoriation of skin of the nasal mucosa and tenderness of the sinuses.</p><p><italic>Pitawakka Navaya</italic> is a decoction used by traditional Sri Lankan physicians in the treatment of <italic>Kaphaja Shirsha Shoola</italic> (chronic sinusitis). This name was given because this decoction contains nine ingredients, namely: <italic>Bhoomyamalaka, Haritaki, Bharangi, Chavya, Salarka, Pippali, Guduchi, Shunthi</italic> and <italic>Maricha</italic>. But, so far, no scientific studies have been conducted to evaluate the efficacy of <italic>Pitawakka Navaya</italic> in <italic>Kaphaja Shirsha Shoola</italic> (chronic sinusitis).
