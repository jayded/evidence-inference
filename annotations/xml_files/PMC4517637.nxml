Valine kinetics and fractional albumin synthesis rate (FSR<sub>alb</sub>) were measured with mass spectrometry using [1-<sup>13</sup>C]valine infusion. The Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> test was used to investigate differences between group medians.

Due to underpowering of our study, we could not draw conclusions on the primary outcome parameters.

Because too few patients had completed the study, we were unable to draw conclusions on the effect of a HP diet on protein synthesis and balance. We present our results as new hypothesis generating data.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Dutch Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2334">NTR2334</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Proteins</kwd><kwd>Isotopes</kwd><kwd>Child</kwd><kwd>Congenital heart defect</kwd><kwd>Intensive care</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Critically ill children on a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) usually receive less than recommended protein intake, with 50&#x000a0;% of cumulative deficits developing in the first 48&#x000a0;h of admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. As a result, lean body mass (LBM) deteriorates during the admission period, superimposed on the fact that approximately a quarter of patients is already undernourished on admission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Especially infants and young children after cardiac surgery, due to higher metabolic demands and fluid restriction, may be at risk of undernutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Poor pre-operative nutritional status with further decrease of LBM during admission increases morbidity, infection rate, and length of stay (LOS) in the ICU [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>In pediatric surgical patients, increased endogenous proteolysis with negative net whole-body protein balance, is the result of an endocrine and inflammatory response to surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Additionally, in cardiac surgical procedures, the use of a cardiopulmonary bypass circuit (CPB) induces complement activation, endotoxin release, leukocyte activation, and the release of many pro-inflammatory mediators, adding to the stress response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The importance of early enteral nutrition (EN) in the PICU population was underlined by a recent multi-center trial including&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;5000 critically ill children from 12 North-American PICU&#x02019;s with LOS of&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;96&#x000a0;h, showing a strong and statistically significant association between early EN and lower mortality (odds ratio, 0.51; 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval: 0.34 to 0.76, p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.001) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. However, data on optimal protein intake in the early phase following pediatric cardiac surgery are lacking.

Participants were randomized over the NP and HP diets with equal amount of participants in both groups. Randomization concealment was guaranteed by using sequentially numbered closed envelopes that contained notes with the letters NP or HP. A copy of the randomization list was kept in a locked safe in the pediatric cardiology department to be opened should an adverse event occur. Patients were randomized in order of recruitment as soon as consent had been obtained. Per patient the closed envelope, together with the patients&#x02019; body weight, was send to the department of clinical nutrition on day 1 of the study protocol for preparation of the study diet according to protocol.</p><p>At enrolment, a medical history was obtained and physical examination performed. Preoperatively, the cardiopulmonary bypass circuit was primed with standardized, body weight-related amounts of packed cells and albumin, but not steroids. In the OR, all patients received a multiluminal central venous catheter with the tip in the superior or inferior caval vein, a catheter in a peripheral artery for blood sampling and invasive monitoring of the blood pressure, and a nasogastric feeding tube, according to standard cardiac surgical procedures. Additionally, for study purpose, a nasopharyngeal tube was inserted for aspiration of breath samples. General anesthesia was induced using sevoflurane and fentanyl, sporadically combined with midazolam. During anesthesia and surgery, unexpected events, vascular clamping time and total CPB time were noted. After surgery, the patients were transferred to the PICU for postoperative care and ventilated for 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;h under mild sedation using propofol (standard dose: 1&#x02013;2&#x000a0;mg&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) and morphine (standard dose: 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;h<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>). After cessation of sedation they were extubated at the attending anesthetist&#x02019;s and pediatric intensivist&#x02019;s clinical judgment. During the entire postoperative intensive care period, medical treatment was instigated by the medical staff of the PICU. Notes were made of the amounts of prescribed sedative and analgesic medication.</p><p>After approximately 4&#x000a0;h in the PICU, at time zero (<italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0&#x000a0;h), the liquid study diet was administered in increasing amounts via a nasogastric tube with the use of a feeding pump (Kangaroo 324, Kendall Healthcare products, Mansfield, MA) such that the required feeding rate was reached before <italic>t</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;12&#x000a0;h (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). The researchers, the parents of the children, and the medical and nursing staff of the PICU were blinded for the composition of the study diets.

However, the observed differences between groups with regard to these primary outcome parameters showed such wide confidence intervals without statistical significance, that we could not exclude the occurrence of a predefined clinically relevant difference in valine balance of &#x0003e;0.65&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> in either direction.

Moreover, in our study in children following cardiac surgery, the CPB circuit was primed with albumin (median [range]: 1.5 [1.0 to 4.2] g&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) as part of standard procedure, resulting in relatively high plasma albumin concentrations in the NP and HP groups, which might further have suppressed albumin synthesis in our patients.</p><p>In our study, we have infused the bicarbonate and valine isotopes for 15 and 12&#x000a0;h, respectively (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). As a consequence of this long infusion period, we might have induced recycling of the labelled valine, resulting in the release of the isotopic tracer from previously synthesized proteins into the blood compartment. This might have resulted in higher plasma <sup>13</sup>C-valine enrichment, with subsequent underestimation of total valine flux, endogenous Ra<sub>val</sub> and NOD<sub>val</sub>. We estimated that this might have affected results in both groups proportionally.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion: in spite of underpowering of the study with regard to short-term effects on protein synthesis and balance of a high protein diet (HP, 5&#x000a0;g&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>), compared to a normal protein diet (NP, 2&#x000a0;g&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;d<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>) in young children following cardiac surgery, our data support the hypothesis that in this population the metabolic fate of surplus protein in the HP diet, compared to the NP diet, was oxidation and ureagenesis.
