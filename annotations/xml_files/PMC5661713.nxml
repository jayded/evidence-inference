Among all types of headache disorders, tension-type headache (TTH) is the most frequent in adults. Epidemiological studies reveal that 20&#x02013;30% of the Asian population suffer from TTH and the global prevalence of TTH in the adult population is 42% [<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. A hospital-based study in Indonesia reported the prevalence of episodic tension-type headache (ETTH) and chronic tension-type headache (CTTH) to be 31% and 24% respectively [<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. There are no helpful investigations in diagnosing TTH so that the definition relies exclusively on clinical symptoms [<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. According to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, third edition beta version (ICHD-3 beta), CTTH is defined as the occurrence of TTH at a frequency of &#x02265;15 days per month, with typically bilateral, pressing, or tightening in quality, and of mild to moderate intensity, lasting hours to days, or unremitting. The pain does not worsen with routine physical activity but may be associated with mild nausea, photophobia, or phonophobia [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Despite its high prevalence and socioeconomic impact, our understanding of TTH pathogenesis is surprisingly limited. One proposed hypothesis is that nociception from pericranial muscles, sensitisation of pain transmission circuits at the trigeminal nucleus/dorsal horn, and dysregulation of central pain modulation have each been postulated to play a significant role in the pathophysiology of CTTH [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Glutamate, like serotonin and dopamine, is a prominent neurotransmitter in the CNS that mediates fast excitatory synaptic neurotransmission via ionotropic and metabotropic receptors [<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Glutamate is stored intracellularly inside synaptic vesicles where the concentration may be as high as 100 millimolar and is inactive until released into the synapse. Glutamate is believed to be required to activate the trigeminovascular system and central sensitisation. Glutamatergic receptors are the molecular mediators through which glutamate acts and are found in the trigeminovascular system and its structures. The activation of NMDA receptors by glutamate has been hypothesised to play a role in primary headache disorders. Pain perception in CTTH as one of primary headache disorders might be activated through these pathways. By blocking NMDA receptors and, therefore, inhibiting these pathways, memantine could prevent primary headaches [<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Previous studies reported that plasma glutamate levels monitoring in migraine patients might serve as a biomarker of response to treatments and as an objective measure of disease status [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Flunarizine, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, was originally introduced in the 1970s for the treatment of occlusive vascular diseases. The mechanism of action of flunarizine in a migraine is unclear, although its calcium and dopaminergic antagonism may offer some insights into possible subcortical brain targets. It has been reported that flunarizine can also cause inhibition of transmission along the trigeminovascular system [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several studies have demonstrated its efficacy in migraine prophylaxis in adults [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, to our knowledge, there is lack of publications about its efficacy in CTTH treatment.</p><p>We aim to see the flunarizine effect on serum levels of glutamate and its correlation with headache intensity based on the Numeric Rating Scale for pain (NRS) scores in CTTH patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Subjects and procedures</title><p>We studied 73 subjects (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) suffering from CTTH according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2nd edition (ICHD-II) criteria [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Chronic tension-type headache patients were recruited among those attended the outpatient clinic of the Adam Malik General Hospital Medan, Puteri Hijau Hospital and Medan Johor Primary Health Center Medan, Indonesia, during April and August 2016. Seventy-three patients out of ninety-five initially recruited had completed the study protocol until the end of the study and 22 drop out. Of 22 subjects drop out, one female patient discontinued consuming the prophylactic drug given due to an allergic reaction; twenty-one of them did not come back for the second blood samples. They were randomly allocated into three interventional groups to receive one of the following drugs for 15 days (flunarizine 5 mg/day, flunarizine 10 mg/day and amitriptyline12.5 mg/day). We included both male and female patients, between 18-65 years old. We excluded CTTH patients receiving or having received a prophylactic treatment in the previous 4-weeks, patients with neurological deficits related to his/her headache, serious somatic or psychiatric diseases including depression, extrapyramidal disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchial asthma, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, malignancy, pregnancy, lactation and hypersensitive to flunarizine or amitriptyline.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Chronic tension-type headache patient characteristics</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" width="100%"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Characteristics</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">All Patients</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flunarizine 5 mg group (N = 25)</th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1"><italic>Flunarizine 10 mg group (N=25)</italic></th><th align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Amitriptyline 12.5 mg group (N=23)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">N (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">73 (100)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25(34.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25(34.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">23(31.5)</td></tr><tr><th align="center" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="5" rowspan="1">Gender</td></tr><tr><th align="center" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Male (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">13 (17.8)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (16)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 (20)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4 (17.4)</td></tr><tr><th align="center" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Female (%)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60 (82.2)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">21 (84)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20 (80)</td><td align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">19 (82.6)</td></tr><tr><th align="center" colspan="5" rowspan="1"><hr/></th></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mean age &#x000b1; S.D.

However, there was found non-significant very weak negative correlation (r = -0.062; P = 0.385) between serum glutamate and headache intensity. It revealed that decrease headache intensity after flunarizine treatment occurred not through the reduction of serum glutamate levels in CTTH patients. After amitriptyline treatment, there were found significant reductions of serum glutamate levels followed by decreased headache intensity. There was also found moderate positive correlations (r = 0.508; P = 0.007) between serum glutamate and headache intensity. It revealed that the decreased headache intensity after amitriptyline treatment might be related to serum glutamate reduction. Amitriptyline blocks the neuronal reuptake of serotonin and noradrenaline, although this is not the only mode of action of its antinociceptive properties. N-methyl- D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonism and blockade of muscarinic receptors and ion channels may play a role as well [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Accumulated evidence has demonstrated that amitriptyline likely affects multiple receptors associated with pain modulation. For example, amitriptyline has been found to interact with opioids receptors, to inhibit the cellular uptake of adenosine, and to block N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The reduction of serum glutamate levels after 15-day flunarizine treatment reveals that flunarizine influence the glutamatergic transmission in the pathogenesis of a tension-type headache. Although glutamate is thought not to readily cross the blood-brain barrier, the levels of glutamate in the blood are positively correlated with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of glutamate in humans. McGale et al. 1977 reported that the concentration of 13 amino acids in CSF had been shown to be directly related to the plasma concentration [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Alfredsson et.al. 1988 found that the serum and CSF levels of glutamate were positively correlated (R = 0.67, P &#x0003c; 0.05) [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Thus, the peripheral glutamate levels can be postulated to reflect the glutamate levels in the brain per se. In fact, increased plasma levels of glutamate have been reported in some neuropsychiatric disorders, such as epilepsy, Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, in which glutamate excitotoxicity is thought to play a role in the pathophysiology [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>-<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Our results have shown that decreased serum glutamate levels followed by reduction of headache intensity in the treatment with amitriptyline in CTTH patients. It is suggested that the reduction of headache intensity in CTTH patients after amitriptyline administration occurs through the pathway of decreasing serum glutamate since there was significant correlation found between serum glutamate levels and pain intensity in CTTH patients. Conversely, since there was no significant correlation found between serum glutamate and headache intensity after treatments with flunarizine, it is suggested that decreasing of headache intensity occur not through glutamate pathways. However, our data must be interpreted cautiously, considering the limited size of the sample.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This research did not receive any financial support.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Competing Interests:</bold> The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Stovner</surname><given-names>LJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hagen</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Jensen</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Katsarava</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Lipton</surname><given-names>RB</given-names></name><name><surname>Scher</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>The global burden of headache:a documentation of headache prevalence and disability worldwide</article-title><source>Cephalalgia</source><year>2007</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>193</fpage><lpage>210</lpage><comment>https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2982.2007.01288.x PMid:17381554</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">17381554</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sjahrir</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><source>Nyeri Kepala</source><year>2004</year><volume>1</volume><publisher-loc>Medan</publisher-loc><publisher-name>USU Press</publisher-name></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sacco</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Ricci</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Carolei</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Tension-type Headache and Systemic Medical Disorders</article-title><source>Curr Pain Headache Rep</source><year>2011</year><volume>15</volume><fpage>438</fpage><lpage>443</lpage><comment>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11916-011-0222-2 PMid:21861098</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21861098</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><article-title>Headache Classification Committee of the International Headache Society.
