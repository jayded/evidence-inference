While laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the standard treatment in mild and moderate forms, the need for antibiotic therapy after surgery remains undefined. The aim of the randomised controlled Cholecystectomy Antibiotic Randomised Trial (CHART) is therefore to assess if there are benefits in the use of postoperative antibiotics in patients with mild or moderate acute cholecystitis in whom a laparoscopic cholecystectomy is performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>A single-centre, double-blind, randomised trial. After screening for eligibility and informed consent, 300 patients admitted for acute calculus cholecystitis will be randomised into two groups of treatment, either receiving amoxicillin/clavulanic acid or placebo for 5 consecutive days. Postoperative evaluation will take place during the first 30&#x02005;days. Postoperative infectious complications are the primary end point. Secondary end points are length of hospital stay, readmissions, need of reintervention (percutaneous or surgical reinterventions) and overall mortality. The results of this trial will provide strong evidence to either support or abandon the use of antibiotics after surgery, impacting directly in the incidence of adverse events associated with the use of antibiotics, the emergence of bacterial resistance and treatment costs.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>This study and informed consent sheets have been approved by the Research Projects Evaluating Committee (CEPI) of Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (protocol N&#x000b0; 2111).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The results of the trial will be reported in a peer-reviewed publication.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>NCT02057679.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>INFECTIOUS DISEASES</kwd><kwd>laparoscopy</kwd><kwd>cholecystitis</kwd><kwd>postoperative</kwd><kwd>antibiotics</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>More than 90% of the cases of acute calculus cholecystitis (ACC) are associated with gallstones.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>
<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> ACC represents one of the most common complications of cholelithiasis, which can be found in 20% of symptomatic patients. It is known that the initial event in ACC is the obstruction of the gallbladder's drainage due to an impacted gallstone in the Hartmann's pouch or the cystic duct. Intraluminal pressure increases, reducing blood irrigation and lymphatic drainage, which finally produces gallbladder inflammation. It is assumed that this inflammation is initially sterile. However, if the obstruction persists, infection can develop, commonly with bacteria of the family of Enterobacteriacea, <italic>Enteroccocus</italic> spp and anaerobes.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref></p><p>The diagnostic criteria and severity assessment of acute cholecystitis have been well established in the 2007 Tokyo Guidelines, updated in 2013. According to these guidelines, ACC is classified as mild (grade I), moderate (grade II) and severe (grade III). Severe acute cholecystitis is associated with at least one organ dysfunction. Moderate acute cholecystitis is associated with any of the following conditions: elevated white cell count (WCC) (18&#x02005;000/mm<sup>3</sup>); palpable tender mass in the right upper abdominal quadrant; duration of symptoms for more than 72&#x02005;h; marked local inflammation (gangrenous cholecystitis, pericholecystic abscess, hepatic abscess, biliary peritonitis, emphysematous cholecystitis). Mild acute cholecystitis does not meet the criteria of any of the former conditions. It can also be defined as an acute cholecystitis in a healthy patient with no organ dysfunction with only mild inflammatory changes in the gallbladder.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>While laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) is the gold standard treatment of mild and moderate forms of ACC, the need for antibiotic therapy after surgery continues to be a matter of debate. There is a lack of evidence regarding duration and type of antimicrobial therapy after surgery.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;6</xref> The updated Tokyo Guidelines propose to administer antibiotics only up to 24&#x02005;h after surgery for mild ACC and 4&#x02013;7&#x02005;days in moderate or severe cases.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> It has been suggested that a &#x003b2;-lactam monoscheme (ie, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (AMC)) would be adequate in patients with mild and moderate cholecystitis without intraoperative complications such as bile peritonitis, cholangitis, gallbladder perforation or abscesses.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4&#x02013;7</xref> However, the real benefits of its use in these situations have not been well studied. Antibiotics are associated with common adverse effects such as allergic reactions and digestive intolerance (nausea, vomits and diarrhoea). Nowadays, there is a clear tendency towards the rational use of antibiotics in order to prevent bacterial resistance. Amoxicillin has been associated with a 7&#x02013;8% incidence of toxicodermia, 1% of allergy reactions and a very low incidence of anaphylactic shock (0.01&#x02013;0.04% with the use of penicillin).<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Hence, we decided to conduct a randomised controlled trial (RCT) in patients undergoing LC for mild and moderate ACC, randomising patients to receive AMC or placebo after surgery. The primary objective of the present trial is to assess whether antibiotic treatment after LC in mild or moderate ACC reduces the incidence of postoperative infectious complications. The hypothesis is that postoperative antibiotics have no positive impact on patient's outcome and therefore should not be indicated in this subset of patients.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Trial design, setting and randomisation</title><p>The Cholecystectomy Antibiotic Randomised Trial (CHART) is a randomised, controlled and blind to patient, investigator and data analysts study, which compares antibiotic treatment after LC due to mild and moderate ACC versus no antibiotic treatment. From February 2014, surgeons initiated this study (protocol V.1.0) at Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA). This is a teaching hospital affiliated to the University of Buenos Aires Medical School and the HIBA University Medical School.</p><p>All patients admitted with acute calculous cholecystitis will receive parenteral hydration, gastric protection with proton pump inhibitors, analgesics and intravenous treatment with AMC. This treatment is continued until the operation. Surgery will be performed within the first 5&#x02005;days after admission. Those patients who worsen during the waiting time will be explored as soon as possible. Potential complications (such as bile peritonitis, cholangitis, gallbladder perforation or abscesses) or evidence of greater severity of cholecystitis may occur and this can only be diagnosed during surgery. These patients will not be eligible for randomisation and will be dismissed from the statistical analysis. Nevertheless, this group will be considered in the final flow chart.</p><p>After screening for eligibility and informed consent is obtained, patients will be randomised in a 1:1 ratio into one of the following study groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015009502F1">figure 1</xref>):

Most publications on the subject analyse the use of antibiotics after conventional procedures, or mix in the same design open and laparoscopic procedures.</p><p>In the late 1980s, Lau <italic>et al</italic> randomised 203 patients and compared a short course of two doses versus a long course of 7&#x02005;days of cefamandole after early open cholecystectomy. They found that the short course was as effective as the long one in reducing postoperative infectious complications with the additional advantages of lower costs, risks of adverse events and length of hospital stay.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> This was the first study to suggest that a reduction in the use of postoperative antibiotics may be possible. However, this study is outdated given the many changes in bacterial resistance over time and the modern surgical therapies. In addition to these findings, Mazeh <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> conducted a RCT in which they demonstrated that the addition of intravenous antibiotic treatment to supportive care has limited, if any, effect in patients with mild ACC.</p><p>Recently, Regimbeau <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> published a multicentre RCT in which patients admitted with mild and moderate ACC were randomised to antibiotics or no treatment after surgery. In the author's opinion, the main limitation of this study is that it includes both conventional and laparoscopic approaches (15% open cholecystectomies and a 10% conversion rate). It has been widely demonstrated that one of the advantages of the laparoscopic approach is that it is associated with the less surgical side infections rate.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Thus, both approaches should be studied separately. Another limitation of this study is that it does not include a placebo group, which may lead placebo effect bias.</p><p>The trial proposed here is an original study in which, for the first time, antibiotics are compared with placebo after LC in cases of ACC. The CHART is a double-blind RCT designed to evaluate the need for and safety of antibiotic treatment after LC for mild or moderate ACC. The results of this trial will provide strong evidence for decision-making in this matter. This could avoid the unnecessary use of antibiotics after surgery, decreasing the incidence of associated adverse events, as well as the emergence of bacterial resistance and treatment costs.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the Central Pharmacy staff of the HIBA.
