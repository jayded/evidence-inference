The study demonstrated that simvastatin plus niacin treatment reduced the rate of progression of angiographically-documented coronary artery stenoses relative to placebo treatment, and reduced the frequency of clinical endpoints (3 percent) relative to placebo (24 percent). Mean changes in the severity of proximal stenosis during the trial were significantly correlated with on-study levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (r&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.22, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.008), as well as with other lipoprotein measurements <xref rid="pone.0056782-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>LDL is known to comprise multiple subclasses differing in size and density and in their relationships with cardiovascular disease risk <xref rid="pone.0056782-Krauss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056782-Krauss2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. The technique of non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis was first used to identify seven distinct size subclasses of LDL particles <xref rid="pone.0056782-Krauss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, and has subsequently been adapted to provide a measure of the plasma concentration of cholesterol in each of these subclasses <xref rid="pone.0056782-Rainwater1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. In the present report, this method was employed in HATS to assess whether coronary atherosclerosis progression and clinical endpoints in HATS could be attributed to on-study plasma levels of specific LDL subclasses.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Clinical procedures</title><p>The study protocol has been described in detail elsewhere <xref rid="pone.0056782-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref> and is therefore summarized only briefly. Patients (men &#x0003c;63 yr and women &#x0003c;70 yr) were recruited on the basis of having had clinical coronary disease defined as previous myocardial infarction, coronary interventions, or confirmed angina with required percent stenosis, and low HDL cholesterol (&#x02264;35 mg/dl for men and &#x02264;40 mg/dl for women). Plasma LDL-cholesterol was restricted to &#x02264;145 mg/dl and plasma triglycerides to &#x02264;400 mg/dl. Enrollment occurred between 1995 and 1997 in the United States (134 patients) and Canada (26 patients). Treatment assignment was random and double-blinded. The study was approved by the University of Washington institutional review committee and all patients signed informed consent as approved by the human use committee.</p><p>Patients assigned to simvastatin-niacin treatment (with or without antioxidant vitamins) began receiving 10 mg/d simvastatin (Zocor, Merck, West Point, Pa.) if their screening LDL-cholesterol was less than 110 mg/dl and 20 mg/d if over 110 mg/dl. The dose was increased by an additional 10 mg/dl if the LDL-cholesterol did not consistently remain below 110 mg/dl and was reduced by 10 mg/d if their LDL-cholesterol fell below 40 mg/dl. Those in either the placebo or the antioxidant treatment arm received simvastatin if their LDL-cholesterol exceeded 140 mg/dl. Slow release niacin increased from two daily doses of 250 mg (Slo-Niacin, Upsher&#x02013;Smith, Minneapolis) to two daily doses of 1000 mg during the first month of the trial. Crystalline (Niacor, Upsher&#x02013;Smith) replaced slow-release niacin if HDL-cholesterol levels were not increased by at least 5, 8, and 10 mg/dl after 3, 8 and 12 months, respectively. Two 50 mg tablets of active niacin were given as placebo to elicit a flushing response. The antioxidant consisting of 800 IU of vitamin E (as d-alpha-tocopherol), 1000 mg of vitamin C, 25 mg of natural beta carotene, and 100 g of selenium was administered twice daily as gel capsules that were indistinguishable from the placebo. All patients were encouraged to enter an exercise program, increase monounsaturated fat intake, and stop smoking, and were counseled for weight loss.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Laboratory measurements</title><p>Plasma LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations were measured by Northwest Lipid Research Laboratories by procedures that were in accord with the NHLBI/CDC Lipid Standardization Program <xref rid="pone.0056782-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. In addition, LDL-cholesterol was determined at the 12 month time point by a vertical rotor ultracentrifugation procedure that excludes the contribution of intermediate density lipoproteins and Lp(a) to the measurement as defined by the NHLBI/CDC program <xref rid="pone.0056782-Kulkarni1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>LDL subclasses were analyzed using non-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (GGE) of fasting samples taken at baseline and after 24 months. Aliquots of 3.0 mL of whole plasma were mixed 1:1 with a sampling buffer of 20% sucrose and 0.25% bromophenol blue. Electrophoresis of samples and size calibration standards was performed using 2%&#x02013;14% polyacrylamide gradients at 150 V for 3 hours following a 15-minute pre-run at 75 V as described previously <xref rid="pone.0056782-Krauss1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Gels were stained with 0.07% Sudan black for 1 hr and stored in a 0.81% acetic acid, 4% methanol solution until they were scanned by computer-assisted densitometry for determination of areas of LDL-IVb (22.0&#x02013;23.2 nm), LDL-IVa (23.3&#x02013;24.1 nm), LDL-IIIb (24.2&#x02013;24.6 nm), LDL-IIIa (24.7&#x02013;25.5 nm), LDL-IIb (25.6&#x02013;26.4 nm), LDL-IIa (26.5&#x02013;27.1 nm), and LDL-I (27.2&#x02013;28.5 nm). Since the absorbance profiles of LDL particles stained with Sudan Black have been shown to reflect the cholesterol distribution among LDL subclasses <xref rid="pone.0056782-Rainwater1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, the cholesterol concentrations of the subclasses were determined by multiplying percent of the total stained LDL for each subclass by the cholesterol measured in the ultracentrifugally isolated LDL fractions. Although this measurement was not available at the 24 month time point, the use of the 12 month value was taken to be representative of the overall on-study LDL-cholesterol level <xref rid="pone.0056782-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>Arteriography was performed and interpreted without knowledge of the patient's treatment assignment. At baseline and follow-up, eight views of the left and right coronary arteries were filmed after sublingual administration of 0.2 to 0.4 mg nitroglycerin <xref rid="pone.0056782-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>. The locations of all lesions that caused &#x02265;15% stenosis of the luminal diameter were mapped. Baseline and follow-up images were compared side-by-side to measure the minimal luminal diameter (Diameter<sub>minimum</sub>) and nearby normal diameters (Diameter<sub>normal</sub>) in millimeters using the catheter for calibration. Stenosis was expressed as a percentage (i.e., 100<sup>*</sup>(Diameter<sub>normal</sub> -Diameter<sub>minimum</sub>)/(Diameter<sub>normal</sub>)). The prespecified primary end point was the mean change per patient from the initial arteriogram to the final arteriogram in the percent stenosis caused by the most severe lesion in each of the nine proximal coronary segments. Secondary end points included the mean change in percent stenosis in lesions of varying degrees of severity. Results are also presented for all stenotic lesions measured in each patient. Prespecified primary clinical endpoints were death from coronary causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization for worsening ischemia.</p><p>Statistics. Analysis of variance was used to assess the significance of the mean differences between groups, standard least-squares regression analyses were used to assess the association between changes in percent stenosis and on-study lipoprotein concentrations, and logistic regression analyses were used to test for significant associations between the odds for primary clinical endpoints and LDL-peak diameter and LDL-subclass concentrations. Baseline age, sex, BMI, current smoking status, and standard clinical lipid measurements (on study HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations) were included as covariates where indicated. All hypotheses were two-sided.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>One hundred forty six of the original 160 patients enrolled into the study completed the angiographic protocol <xref rid="pone.0056782-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.

<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0056782-t002">Table 2</xref> shows that during the study, those assigned to simvastatin-niacin treatment significantly increased their LDL peak diameter and plasma HDL-cholesterol concentrations, and significantly reduced their mean plasma concentrations of LDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, and all LDL subclasses except LDL-IIIb relative to placebo assignment. On-study LDL-cholesterol levels in LDL-IIb, LDL-IIIa, LDL-IIIb, LDL-IVa and LDL-IVb were on average significantly lower in the simvastatin-niacin treatment group than placebo, as were total LDL-cholesterol and triglyceride concentrations, while HDL-C levels were significantly higher than those on placebo. Antioxidant treatment alone significantly reduced LDL-peak diameter and increased LDL-IIIb cholesterol relative to placebo. The combination of simvastatin-niacin and antioxidants significantly lowered triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, LDL-I, LDL-IIa, LDL-IIb, and LDL-IIIa, and increased HDL-cholesterol, relative to placebo.</p><table-wrap id="pone-0056782-t002" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0056782.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>On-study and change from baseline plasma lipoprotein subfraction concentrations (95% confidence interval) by treatment assignment.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0056782-t002-2" xlink:href="pone.0056782.t002"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjustment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Placebo</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Simvastatin &#x00026; Niacin</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Antioxidant vitamins</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Simvastatin, Niacin &#x00026; Antioxidant vitamins</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Anova significance for group differences</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LDL-peak</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">On study</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.82</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.40</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25.48</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">26.04</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(25.57, 26.08)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(26.15, 26.65)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(25.25, 25.71)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">(25.81, 26.27)</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0056782-t003">Table 3</xref> displays the relationships of the on-study LDL-subclass cholesterol concentrations to average change in percent stenosis. Analyses are presented for the most severe lesions at baseline and separately for lesions with &#x0003e;50%, 30&#x02013;49%, or &#x0003c;30% stenosis at baseline. The percent stenosis of the most severe proximal lesions increased in association with higher on-study concentrations of LDL-IIIb, LDL-IVa and LDL-IVb, and smaller on-study LDL-peak diameter, without adjustment for treatment group assignment, and increased significantly with higher on-study concentrations of LDL-IIIb and LDL-IVa when further adjusted for treatment assignment, and both treatment assignment and on study HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride concentrations. The associations between the changes in percent stenosis and the LDL subclasses appeared to be most specific to those lesions at baseline with &#x0003c;30% stenosis (LDL-IIIb and LDL-IVa, and LDL-peak diameter).</p><table-wrap id="pone-0056782-t003" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0056782.t003</object-id><label>Table 3</label><caption><title>Regression slope (95% confidence interval) for three-year changes in percent stenosis per nm increase in on-study LDL-peak diameter and per mmol/L increase LDL-cholesterol subfraction concentrations.</title></caption><alternatives><graphic id="pone-0056782-t003-3" xlink:href="pone.0056782.t003"/><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Adjustment</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">All</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesions with &#x02265;50% stenosis at baseline</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesions with 30&#x02013;49% stenosis at baseline</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesions with 0&#x02013;29% stenosis at baseline</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">LDL-peak</td><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/></tr><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Moreover, on-study LDL-IIIb was independently associated with the primary clinical cardiovascular endpoint in HATS. The analyses also adjusted for treatment assignment because of concerns that simvastatin&#x02013;niacin treatment might decrease coronary artery disease progression and reduce the risk for clinical events independent of its direct effects on lipoprotein levels. Without group adjustment, an association between the subclass concentrations and progression or clinical endpoints could simply be secondary to primary effects of simvastatin-niacin both lowering LDL-subclass concentrations and affecting disease progression. Otherwise stated, on-study subclass level might simply be a surrogate measure for group assignment. The retained significance of on-study LDL-IIIb and LDL-IVa when adjusted for treatment group shows that this is not the case. This approach also renders the results conservative because the adjustment also reduces the influence of antiatherogenic effects of the LDL-subclass reductions produced by the treatment.</p><p>The findings are consistent with prior evidence linking levels of cholesterol in small LDL particles to progression of coronary atherosclerosis as assessed by quantitative coronary angiography <xref rid="pone.0056782-Williams1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> and association between small LDL particles and native CAD progression following PTCA or CABG <xref rid="pone.0056782-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. In the present study, this relationship was strongest for LDL-IIIb and IVa; in the case of the smallest LDL particles (LDL-IV), the associations were not consistent for all statistical adjustments. Although it has been suggested that specific properties of smaller vs. larger LDL particles, such as greater arterial proteoglycan binding and oxidative susceptibility, may be directly responsible for their enhanced atherogenic potential, there is insufficient evidence to assess the extent to which increased levels of these particles denote other pathologic mechanisms <xref rid="pone.0056782-Berneis1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056782-Krauss2" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In this regard, it is of interest that increased concentrations of small LDL particles (specifically LDL-IIIb and LDL-IVa and IVb) have been found to be selectively associated with a common single nucleotide polymorphism that increases hepatic apo B secretion and reduces LDL catabolism via upregulation of hepatic sortilin, and is linked to increased CHD risk <xref rid="pone.0056782-Musunuru1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0056782-Strong1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>Our results are also consistent with the association of CHD with apo C-III containing LDL <xref rid="pone.0056782-Luc1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0056782-Mendivil1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, in that apoC-III is enriched in the smallest LDL particles <xref rid="pone.0056782-Shin1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.

Although 24-month Friedewald calculations of LDL-cholesterol were available <xref rid="pone.0056782-Friedewald1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, these are both indirect and include IDL-cholesterol in addition to LDL-cholesterol. The calculated on-study LDL-IIIb cholesterol concentrations based on Friedewald values at 24 months did achieve statistical significance for relation to the change in percent stenosis for proximal vessels with &#x0003c;30% stenosis at baseline (P&#x0003c;0.0001 unadjusted for treatment assignment, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002 adjusted for treatment assignment, and P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003 adjusted for both treatment assignment and other lipoproteins), but not for relation to change of all proximal vessels (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.15, and P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.13, respectively), or to primary clinical endpoints (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.03, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.16, P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.10, respectively, analyses not displayed). This suggests to us that the inaccuracies in applying the Friedewald estimates to the LDL-particle distribution at 24 months were greater than those created by using the direct measurement of LDL-cholesterol at 12 months despite the separation in time of these measurements. The decision to use the 12 month vertical spin LDL-cholesterol was made a priori by one of us (RMK) independent of the analyses. In fact, the LDL-IIIb cholesterol concentrations calculated using the 24-month Friedewald LDL-cholesterol values differed little from those calculated from LDL-cholesterol measured directly at 12 months, just enough to fall short of 5% significance for all vessels and clinical endpoints. Other than providing a more accurate assessment of the on-study LDL-subclass concentrations, we can think of no plausible explanation for greater significance using LDL-cholesterol measured directly at 12 months than the 24-month Friedewald estimation. The earlier reports from this study also assume measurements taken at various time points during the intervention were representative of on-study exposures <xref rid="pone.0056782-Brown1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>.</p><p>The analyses presented in the current paper were not designed to test the efficacy of simvastatin-niacin per se, nor whether treatment benefits are dependent upon LDL-cholesterol levels, but rather to identify associations of on-study LDL-subfractions to coronary disease progression when adjusted for treatment status. In this regard, statin and niacin therapy contribute to inter-individual differences LDL-subclass concentrations, enhancing our ability to identify these associations.</p><p>The highly significant result for LDL-IIIb would remain significant using Bonferroni correction.

This would suggest only four primary hypotheses, and among these, the reported association between on-study LDL-IIIb and atherosclerosis progression (<italic>P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10<sup>&#x02212;8</sup></italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0056782-t003">Table 3</xref>), and clinical events (P&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.01, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0056782-t004">Table 4</xref>) would survive Bonferroni adjustment.</p><p>Recently, the AIM HIGH (Atherothrombosis Intervention in Metabolic Syndrome with Low HDL/High Triglycerides: Impact on Global Health) trial was terminated for failing to show that raising HDL-cholesterol and lowering triglycerides with niacin treatment resulted in reduced cardiovascular events <xref rid="pone.0056782-AIMHIGH1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. The patients, recruited for heart and vascular disease, low HDL-cholesterol, and increased triglycerides, were also administered statin and ezetimibe as required to achieve LDL-cholesterol levels between 40&#x02013;80 mg/dL. It is possible that when LDL levels are sufficiently low, any cardioprotective effects of raising HDL cholesterol and/or reducing triglycerides with niacin are diminished. The results of the present analyses further suggest that reductions in levels of small LDL particles have a particularly important role in determining the benefits of lipid-lowering therapy on coronary atherosclerosis progression in patients with reduced HDL cholesterol.</p><p>Conclusion: In the HATS trial of simvastatin-niacin vs. placebo, low on-study levels of cholesterol in small LDL particles were associated with reduced rate of coronary atherosclerosis progression and the primary clinical cardiovascular endpoint, and these relationships were independent of standard lipid levels. The results support the value of assessing LDL subfractions for the management of cardiovascular disease risk.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Patricia Blanche and the staff of the CHORI Lipoprotein Analysis Core Laboratory for the gradient gel electrophoresis measurements.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0056782-Brown1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
