Patients will be evaluated on days 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14; the following information will being collected: daily oxycodone dose; average and maximum pain (Numerical Rating Scale); pain relief (Pain Relief Scale); characteristics of the pain (Neuropathic Pain Scale); impact of pain on the patient's daily activities (Brief Pain Inventory). The primary outcome will be oxycodone dosage needed to achieve satisfactory analgaesia on day 14. Secondary outcomes will be pain relief on day 2, time needed to achieve satisfactory analgaesia and time needed to achieve a pain reduction of 50%.

Starting by day 2, the opioid dose will be titrated every 48&#x02005;h in order to reach the maximum therapeutic goal and to minimise side effects. At each clinical evaluation on day 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 14, the dose of the oxycodone will be increased by 5&#x02013;10&#x02005;mg, according to patient&#x02019;s age, body weight, and renal and liver function, to reach a NRS&#x02264;4.

To ensure allocation concealment, the block size will not be disclosed and allocation will be assigned using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. Trial participants, care providers and data collectors, including outcome assessors and data analysts, will be blinded to group allocation. Magnesium and placebo are white powder, indistinguishable to the eye and to the touch. Oral magnesium and placebo will be prepared by two physicians in the Acute Pain Service using identical test tubes. In particular, the contents of each magnesium sachet will be poured into a small plastic test tube, and the same will be done for the 10&#x02005;g of fructose (1 measuring spoon).

We considered a mean oxycodone dose of 20.25&#x02005;mg (SD 10&#x02005;mg) on day 14 in the control group, based on data from 270 patients with advanced PAOD treated by our Acute Pain Service in the period 2012&#x02013;2014. For a significance threshold of 5% (p&#x0003c;0.05, two-sided test), 116 patients (58 per group) would be needed to achieve 90% power to detect a minimum reduction in oxycodone dose of 30% in the experimental compared with the control group (ie, mean oxycodone dose of 14.18&#x02005;mg in the experimental group). The target sample size was increased to 150 patients (75 per group) to account for a possible dropout rate of approximately 20%. The sample size of 150 patients allows for an 80% power to detect an increase in pain relief on day 2 (secondary outcome) from 10% in the control group to a minimum of 30% in the experimental group.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Descriptive statistics will be used to summarise patients&#x02019; characteristics and baseline outcome data in the two treatment groups. Differences between experimental and control group in daily oxycodone dose on day 14 (primary outcome) and pain relief on day 2 (secondary outcome) will be analysed using a t test if the data (original or transformed) are normally distributed, and with a Mann-Whitney U test if normality cannot be achieved. For the two time-to-event secondary outcomes (time needed to achieve satisfactory analgaesia and 50% pain reduction), differences between the two groups will be tested using a log-rank test. In the case of imbalance between the two groups in baseline characteristics strongly associated with the outcome (confounding by chance), sensitivity analyses with adjustment for these covariates will be performed, using multiple linear regression and Cox regression. Analyses will be performed according to the intention to treat principle.</p><p>All tests will be two tailed, and p&#x0003c;0.05 will be considered as significant.

Magnesium may aid in maximising the effectiveness of opioids while reducing their dose, and thus the severity of side effects.</p><p>In addition to its NMDA-blocking properties, magnesium has vasodilatory effects, improves endothelial function<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> and exerts antidepressant action.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> If proved effective, the analgaesic effect might be due to a combined mechanism. Magnesium has a high safety profile, lacks serious side effects and is a low cost drug. The most frequent and expected side effect is mild diarrhoea, which could be helpful in counteracting opioid-related constipation.</p><p>As a single-centre RCT, demonstration of the analgaesic efficacy of magnesium supplementation would require replication in other centres before magnesium is adopted as a standard of treatment in advanced-stage patients with PAOD with severe pain; in particular, generalisability of results to patients with PAOD with less severe disease or to other conditions characterised by acute neuropathic pain would require further evidence.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>Detailed written information will be provided to the patients about the study protocol, the purpose of research and the safety of magnesium treatment.
