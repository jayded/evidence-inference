This study aims to establish the non-inferiority of oral monotherapy (flucloxacillin alone) to dual therapy (flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin) for the outpatient treatment of cellulitis in adults.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This study is a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of adults who present to the emergency department (ED) with cellulitis that is deemed treatable on an outpatient basis with oral antibiotics. After fulfilling specified inclusion and exclusion criteria, informed consent will be taken. Patients will be given a treatment pack containing 7 days of treatment with flucloxacillin 500 mg four times daily and placebo or flucloxacillin 500 mg four times daily and phenoxymethylpenicillin 500 mg four times daily. The primary outcome measure under study is the proportion of patients in each group in which there is greater than or equal to a 50% reduction in the area of diameter of infection from the area measured at enrolment at the end-of-treatment visit (7 to 10 days). Secondary endpoints include a health-related quality of life measurement as rated by the SF-36 score and the Extremity Soft Tissue Infection Score (not validated), compliance and adverse events. Patients will be followed up by telephone call at 3 days, end-of-treatment visit (EOT) at 7 to 10 days and test-of-cure (TOC) visit at 30 days. To achieve 90% power, a sample size of 172 patients per treatment arm is needed. This assumes a treatment success rate of 85% with oral flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin, an equivalence threshold &#x00394; = 12.5% and an &#x003b1; = 0.025. Non-inferiority will be assessed using a one-sided confidence interval on the difference of proportions between the two groups. Standard analysis including per-protocol and intention-to-treat will be performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>This trial aims to establish the non-inferiority of flucloxacillin monotherapy to dual therapy in the treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis among ED patients. In doing so, this trial will bridge a knowledge gap in this understudied and common condition and will be relevant to clinicians across several different disciplines.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>EudraCT Number

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Current use tends to regard the term erysipelas as a form of cellulitis rather than as a distinct entity in which a raised leading edge represents dermal inflammation alone
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Indeed, the terminology used to describe various types of skin and soft tissue infection (SSTI) is complicated because of the use of terms to describe different types of infection (cellulitis, erysipelas, abscess), clinical scenarios (Fournier gangrene) and aetiological agents (&#x02018;clostridial myonecrosis&#x02019;)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>Cellulitis is an understudied condition and the numbers of patients seen and treated in Irish emergency departments (EDs) is unknown. In 2009 in Ireland it accounted for 3,877 hospital admissions resulting in a median hospital length-of-stay (LOS) of 4 days
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. In the United Kingdom, one survey showed that it accounted for 3% of emergency visits to a district hospital
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>] and results in approximately 69,576 hospital admissions annually
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. In the Netherlands, cellulitis and erysipelas accounted for 3,500 hospitalisations in 1999 to 2001, with an average LOS of 12.1 days
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. The population prevalence in the same year was 15.2/100,000 inhabitants, with ten times as many patients treated in the community as in hospital. In the era of community acquired methicillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> (CA-MRSA) infection in the United States, outpatient visits for purulent skin and soft tissue infection increased from 32.1 to 48.1 per 1,000 population between 1997 and 2005
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] with a four-fold increase in hospitalisation rate for cellulitis/abscess between 1999 and 2005
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Cellulitis and erysipelas cost on average &#x020ac;5,300 per hospitalised patient in the Netherlands in 1999 to 2001, with total costs of &#x020ac;13.7 million
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>].</p><p><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and &#x003b2;-haemolytic Streptococci Lancefield Group A, C and G are the most common causative agents of cellulitis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In a recent systematic review examining the bacteriological etiology of cellulitis in intact skin, Chira <italic>et al</italic>.
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] examined 16 trials involving 808 patients. Only 16% had positive cultures, of which <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> was almost twice as commonly isolated as Streptococcus Group A. This finding is especially relevant in North America where the onset of true CA-MRSA infection has reached epidemic proportions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. Enterococci are occasionally isolated, usually in patients with leg ulcers, and anaerobic bacteria are the least commonly isolated subgroup and include <italic>Peptostreptococcus</italic> species, <italic>Bacteroides fragilis</italic>, <italic>Prevotella</italic> species, <italic>Porphyromonas</italic> species and <italic>Clostridium</italic> species
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. In clinical practice, the majority of these infections can be treated on an outpatient basis with European
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>] and North American
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] prescribing guidelines recommending beta-lactam antibiotics active against gram-positive bacteria. Despite the increase in CA-MRSA, the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) also still recommends beta-lactam antibiotics for &#x02018;non-purulent&#x02019; cellulitis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Cellulitis is clinically apparent as an area of spreading erythema characterised by warmth, pain and tenderness to palpation. It is on a spectrum of disease from mild infections, easily treatable with oral antibiotics, to severe necrotizing infections with associated high mortality. However, most people are not seriously ill and have a low risk of complications
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>].</p><sec><title>Measures of severity</title><p>There are no internationally accepted criteria for &#x02018;mild, moderate and severe&#x02019; cellulitis although this classification scheme is widely used in clinical practice
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. The classification used by Eron <italic>et al</italic>.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. Flucloxacillin either alone or in combination with phenoxymethylpenicillin or its intravenous form, benzylpenicillin, are commonly prescribed in Great Britain and Ireland

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], the national prescribing formulary in the United Kingdom
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] and local guidelines, provide conflicting information on whether monotherapy with flucloxacillin or dual therapy with combined flucloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin is optimal, particularly for cellulitis treatable on an outpatient basis. Recent evidence has shown that oral phenoxymethylpenicillin prevents cellulitis recurrence in patients with two or more episodes of leg cellulitis

All staff will have received training on all aspects of the trial protocol prior to commencement of the trial.</p><p>The principal investigator (PI) or authorised member of the team will have a written procedure for requesting randomisation codes for rapidly identifying a blinded IMP in an emergency. Breaking the blind of a trial subject will be at the discretion of the PI, when clinically indicated for the safety of the patient, or in the event of a SUSAR. If the patient needs to be unblinded we will refer to the unblinding SOP for complete details of the procedures to be followed. The master randomisation codes will be kept by the clinical trial Pharmacist and the PI. Unblinding will be performed by the senior clinician/pharmacist when the criteria for a Serious Adverse Event (SAE/SUSAR) have been met and there is a necessity for the PI or treating healthcare professional to know which treatment the patient is receiving to ensure that the patient receives appropriate urgent safety measures.</p><p>A 24-hour contact number will be available in the circumstances when unblinding is required. The scenario will be communicated and when the unblinding criteria are met the unblinding will ensue. The PI will document the breaking of the code, and the reasons for doing so, in the site file and in the patient&#x02019;s medical notes, and in accordance with the clinical trial protocol. If at the EOT visit a clinical failure is apparent and the addition of phenoxymethylpenicillin is felt to be clinically necessary, code breaking will be made possible on a 24-hour basis by making contact with the PI.

Sample sizes were calculated using PASS statistical software (Hintze J.(2008) PASS 2008. NCSS, LLC, Kaysville, Utah, USA <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncss.com">http://www.ncss.com</ext-link>). Given the preferred study power of 90% for non-inferiority trials, a minimum sample size of 172 in each treatment group is required (n = 344). Non-inferiority will be assessed using a one-sided confidence interval (CI) on the difference of proportions between the two groups. If the upper limit of the CI is less than the equivalence threshold of 12.5%, then non-inferiority is inferred.</p><sec><title>Data analysis</title><p>Both intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol analysis will be performed. ITT analyses include all patients randomised to the trial regardless of whether they satisfied entry requirements, received the assigned treatments, withdrew from the trial or adhered to the protocol. Missing values will be imputed using a suitable imputation method (last value carried forward or mixed model). A per-protocol analysis includes only patients who completed the full course of treatment and adhered to the protocol requirements. In a non-inferiority trial setting a per-protocol analysis may be more appropriate since it is more likely to reflect actual differences between the two treatments. Furthermore, ITT analysis may be interpreted as being too liberal in a non-inferiority trial and may bias toward making the two treatments appear similar
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. As a result, both an ITT and per-protocol analysis will be performed on the resulting data to assess non-inferiority of the placebo/flucloxacillin combination. In particular, to declare non-inferiority, both ITT and per protocol analysis should exclude the non-inferiority margin.</p></sec><sec><title>Bias and confounding variables</title><p>In terms of selection bias, we feel that this study targets a patient population to whom this research ultimately will be clinically applicable and valuable. Every effort will be made to ensure that recruitment of participants occurs over all 24-hour periods (including weekends) by having patients recruited by the ED physician treating the patient. We anticipate that the randomised, double-blinded, controlled design of this study will minimise the effect of confounding variables on our analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Safety reporting</title><p>All adverse events that occur during the study period observed by one of the clinical staff, or reported by the patient or parent/guardian spontaneously, or in response to a direct question, will be noted on the appropriate form (that is, Adverse Event (AE), SAE or SUSAR form). These forms are de-identified. The following procedures will take place depending on the type of event that has occurred.</p><sec><title>Adverse event</title><p>Each AE will be recorded by a member of the research team on an AE Form. Adverse events will be classified on the form in terms of their severity, association with the study drug, expectedness and seriousness. They will be recorded on an Adverse Event Log. The adverse events will be reported to the sponsor and to the institutional Health Research Ethics Committee (HREC) on a yearly basis as part of an annual safety report, and at the end of the trial.</p></sec><sec><title>Serious adverse event</title><p>Each SAE will be recorded by a member of the research team on an SAE Form. SAEs will be classified on the form in terms of their severity, relatedness to the study drug, and expectedness. They will be recorded on a Serious Adverse Event Log. All SAEs will be reported on the SAE form within 24 hours to the sponsor and the institutional HREC. The research team will ensure that follow-up information and a detailed written report are provided when available.</p></sec><sec><title>Suspected unexpected serious adverse drug reactions</title><p>Each SUSAR will also require expedited reporting to the sponsor. This will occur as soon as possible, but no later than 24 hours after a member of the research team has first knowledge of the minimum criteria for expedited reporting. In each case, relevant follow-up information will be sought and a detailed, written report completed as soon as possible. The sponsor has responsibility to ensure all relevant and available information is forwarded to the competent authority (Irish Medicines Board) and the appropriate HREC. For fatal or life-threatening events this will be done as soon as possible and not later than seven days after the sponsor becomes aware of the event. Additional relevant information will be sent within eight days of the first report. This will be sent no later than an additional 15 calendar days. For AEs that are not fatal or life threatening, the sponsor will ensure that a SUSAR is reported as soon as possible and in any event not later than 15 days after the sponsor is first aware of the event.</p><p>The study participants will be provided with 24-hour contact details of a study representative if they have concerns about any component of the study.</p></sec></sec></sec></sec><sec><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial requires further funding in order to commence enrolment.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: Adverse event; CA-MRSA: Community acquired methicillin resistant <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>; CI: Confidence interval; CSTAR: Centre for support and training in analysis and research; CREST: Clinical resource efficiency support team; ED: Emergency department; EOT: End-of-treatment; GCP: Good clinical practice; GP: General practitioner; HREC: Health research ethics committee; IMB: Irish medicines board; ITT: Intention to treat; LOS: Length of stay; NHS: National health service; PI: Principal investigator; SAE: Serious adverse event; SNOSE: Sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelope; SOP: Standard operating procedure; SSTI: Skin and soft tissue infection; SUSAR: Suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction; TOC: Test-of-cure.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MQ, PG, AW and ROS conceived the study and each made substantial contributions to design; all have been involved in drafting the manuscript and revising it critically for intellectual content; and have given final approval of the version to be published.</p></sec></body><back><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Statistical advice for this protocol was provided by Ms. Norma Coffey from the School of Mathematical Sciences/Systems Biology Ireland, University College Dublin (UCD), Ireland.
