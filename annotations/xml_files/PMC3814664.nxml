<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Concept of rigid fixation: Spiessl[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>] introduced compression plates, which were fixed along the lower border of fractured mandible using bicortical screws. Compression plates rigidly fixed the fractured bone segments sufficiently to prevent inter-fragmentary movement and provide healing by primary intention. Difficulty in adaptation, bulk of the plates, scar formation due to extraoral approach, and increased chances of nerve injury were their disadvantages</p></list-item><list-item><p>Concept of semi-rigid fixation: Champy <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>] defined the &#x0201c;ideal lines of osteosynthesis&#x0201d; based on experiments of GEBOAS (Group of Research in Bones and Joint Biomechanics of Strasbourg). Champy revolutionized intraoral fixation by innovating and modifying the Michelet <italic>et al</italic>.'s[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] technique of osteosynthesis. It consisted of mono-cortical, juxta alveolar, and subapical osteosynthesis without compression and intermaxillary fixation using miniaturized malleable plates. Small size of the plate, easy adaptability, easy placement, and use of intraoral approach led to increased use of mono-cortical plates in maxillofacial surgery.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>]</p></list-item></list>
</p><p>However, Luhr and AO/ASIF[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] advocates felt that miniplates did not offer adequate stabilization of the fractures, thereby necessitating the need of further inter-maxillary fixation. Farmand and Dupoirieux[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] presented 3-D plates with quadrangular shape formed by joining two mini-plates with interconnecting crossbars. Because of the quadrangular configuration of the plates, they provided good stability and resistance to torsional forces. Easy use, good resistance against torque forces, and compact form of the plates were some of their advantages.</p><p>Considering the above, this study was carried out to compare the conventional 2-mm miniplates and 3-D miniplates in terms of treatment outcome, stability, duration of surgery, and complications of treatment of mandible fractures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective study consisting of a sample size of 28 patients (18 males and 10 females) with undisplaced as well as displaced mandible fractures conducted at Govt. Dental College and Hospital, Ahmedabad. Exclusion criteria for study were comminuted, malunited, and infected fractures as well as mandibular coronoid and condylar fractures. All patients were within the age group of 18-60 years, excluding medically compromised patients.</p><p>The patients were divided randomly (single-blind control trial study) into two groups of 20 patients each, but the number of patients of each type were divided equally. Group I was treated with open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) using 3-D miniplates and Group II were treated with conventional 2-mm (2-D) stainless steel miniplates. Also, 2-mm, 4-hole with gap conventional 2-D and 6-hole with gap 3-D stainless steel miniplates were used. Three-dimensional designs were formed by joining two 2-D miniplates with interconnecting vertical crossbars. Then, 2 &#x000d7; 8 mm and 2 &#x000d7; 10 mm stainless steel self-tapping screws were used to fix the plates. The diameter of head of screw was 2.8 mm with countersinking of the head corresponding to the 30-degree beveled hole in the plate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>].</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Conventional 2.0-mm S.S miniplates and 3-D S.S plates used in the mandible fracture</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g001"/></fig><p>Reduction and fixation of fracture segments was done intraorally under GA, except in some inaccessible angle fractures where transbuccal approach was used. In Group I patients, fixation of the 3-D plates was done in the following manner: In the symphysis/parasymphysis region, the upper crossbar of 3-D plates was placed in subapical position of teeth, and injury to dental roots was avoided using mono-cortical screws. In the region posterior to mental foramen, 3-D plates was placed in such a way that upper cross bar was between root apex and inferior alveolar nerve. In the region of angle, 3-D plate was placed in such way that vertical strut was perpendicular to external oblique ridge. Here, we showed a preoperative and postoperative series of photographs and radiographs of right parasymphysis fracture fixed with 3-D plates [Figures <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F6">6</xref>].</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Preoperative photograph of patient with right parasymphysis fracture showing deranged occlusion</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g002"/></fig><fig id="F3" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Preoperative OPG show right parasymphysis fracture between right lateral incisior and canine with fracture line runs downward and backward</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g003"/></fig><fig id="F4" position="float"><label>Figure 4</label><caption><p>Intraoperative photograph of patient showing reduction and fixation of right parasymphysis fracture site using 2.0-mm, 6-hole, 3-D plates via intraoral degolving incision (Group 1)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g004"/></fig><fig id="F5" position="float"><label>Figure 5</label><caption><p>Postoperative photograph of patient with right parasymphysis fracture showing perfect occlusion</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g005"/></fig><fig id="F6" position="float"><label>Figure 6</label><caption><p>Postoperative OPG showing reduction and fixation of right parasymphysis fracture with 2.0-mm, 6-hole, 3-D plates</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g006"/></fig><p>In Group II patients, fixation of conventional 2-D miniplates was done along the osteosynthesis lines as described by Champy.

This is in accordance with the study by Bormann <italic>et al</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Out of 28 patients in our study, 18 were male (64.29%) and 10 (35.71%) were female <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>. This male dominance was also reported by Haug <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] The age group most commonly affected was 21-30 years (40%). Eight patients had bilateral mandible fracture and 12 had unilateral fracture. The most common site of mandible fracture was parasymphysis (35%) and angle (35%), followed by body (20%) and symphysis (10%) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F12">Graph 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Pattern of etiology of fracture in the present study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g012"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Gender distribution of patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g013"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T3" position="float"><label>Table 3</label><caption><p>Distribution of fracture site, favorability of fracture site, methods of fixation of fracture site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g014"/></table-wrap><fig id="F12" position="float"><label>Graph 1</label><caption><p>(a, b) Distribution of fracture site, favorability of fracture site, and methods of fixation of fracture site</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g015"/></fig><p>Among patients in Group II, in 1 patient, there was intraoral exposure of plate and intraoral pus discharge at left lower-third molar region. X-ray OPG of patient shows fractured 2-D miniplate at the left angle [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F13">Figure 12</xref>]. This complication was treated by removal of implant, intraorally under higher antibiotic coverage. No incidence of plate failure was reported in Group I patients, which coincides with the report by Guimond <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref>] on fixation of mandible angle fracture with 3-D plates [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. Fracture of mandibular angle is associated with highest incidence of postsurgical infection of all mandible fractures reported by Lizuka and Lindquist.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>]</p><fig id="F13" position="float"><label>Figure 12</label><caption><p>X-ray OPG shows fractured 2.0-mm conventional plate at left angle</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g016"/></fig><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparsion of complication between group I and group II</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="AMS-3-154-g017"/></table-wrap><p>In the angle region where horizontal and vertical rami of mandible meet and where powerful elevator muscles are attached to the ramus, strong distractive forces are created; therefore, to counteract these forces, a strong fixation device is required. In this study, the advantage of 3-D plating system over conventional 2-D miniplates comes from the fact that the screws of the 3-D plates are placed in the box configuration on both sides of the fracture rather than on a single line. Also, a broad platform is created that may increase the resistance to the torsional forces along the axis of the plate. This theory coincides with the study of Alkan <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>]</p><p>One case of tooth damage at the symphysis region was reported among Group I patients. Vitality testing of the injured tooth was done. Endodontic treatment was carried out for the management of injured tooth. The damage occurred due to the larger size of 3-D plate and insufficient vertical height of anterior mandible. Advantage of conventional 2-D miniplates over 3-D miniplates is their small size and easy adaptability, which minimizes the chances of tooth damage [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><p>The occlusion of patients was checked preoperatively and during the follow-up stages after surgery. Among Group II, 2 patients (both displaced parasymphysis + angle fractures) developed postoperative occlusal discrepancy, which was corrected by postoperative inter-maxillary fixation for 4 weeks. None of the patients of Group I developed occlusal discrepancy [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. According to Champy, when only one linear conventional plate is applied at the external oblique ridge in cases of mandibular angle fracture, torsional and bending forces usually cause movement along the axis of the plate with bucco-lingual splaying and gap formation at the inferior border, respectively. This coincides with the study of Gutwald <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>] on angle fracture using various fixation devices. Also, 3-D plates, because of a box-like configuration, provide rigid fixation of fractures that prevent bucco-lingual splaying and gap formation at the fracture site and subsequent occlusal discrepancy; this is the advantage of 3-D miniplates over 2-D miniplates.</p><p>Mobility of fractured segments was evaluated in both groups: In Group II, 2 patients (one symphysis and other angle + parasymphysis fracture) had immediate postoperative mobility present at the fracture site, which was corrected by postoperative inter-maxillary fixation for 4 weeks. In Group I, none of patients had immediate postoperative mobility present at the fracture site [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>]. According to Andrew <italic>et al</italic>., as 3-D plates are square or rectangular units, they provide increased torsional stability. Also, as the symphysis fractures are under greater degree of torsional strain than any other area of the mandible, 3-D plates provide higher stability in this region.</p><p>Duration of surgery was measured from incision to closure of wound. The operating time required for the placement of 3-D plates in the angle region was 20-min extra as compared to intraoral placement of single conventional 2-D miniplate. This finding coincides with the study of Feledy <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] who conducted a study on the time taken for the treatment of angle fractures. In the body region, difference was not significant, average time of 7 min more was taken by 3-D plates; whereas, in the symphysis and parasymphysis region, 20 min more was taken for 3-D plate fixation than for 2-D miniplates.</p><p>In our study, not a single patient treated by 3-D plate developed infection or plate failure, which is not in accordance with Zix <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] who reported 1 patient with fractured 3-D plate that occurred due to reduced inter-fragmentary cross-sectional bone surrounding the fracture site after extraction of molar tooth in angle region, leading to higher torsional forces. Also, an infection rate of 6.6% was reported by Parmar <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] Implant failure (4.54%) and postoperative neurosensory deficit (4.54%) was recorded by Goyal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Fixation of mandibular angle fractures with single conventional miniplates at the upper border is associated with complications like infection, malocclusion, and mobility of fracture segments, as studied by Singh <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Parallel reports has been found in literature in several type of clinical situation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>The 3-D plating system has advantages over conventional 2-D miniplates. Quadrangle geometry of plate assures a 3-D stability of fracture sites as it offers good resistance against torque forces, thereby avoiding the need for inter-maxillary fixation, ensuring early restoration of mandibular function, and reduced rate of infection at fracture site postoperatively. Simplicity, malleability, low profile, ease of application, and reduced infection rate are its advantages over conventional 2-D miniplates.</p><p>Based on the above, it can be concluded that, to minimize the rate of postoperative complications, for fractures of symphysis, displaced parasymphysis and angle and bilateral mandible fractures, 3-D plates could be a better option than conventional 2-mm miniplates. The small sample size and limited follow-up could be considered as the limitations of this study.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold>
