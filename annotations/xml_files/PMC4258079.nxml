However infiltration of local anaesthetics to non-sedated calves is often difficult. Disbudding-related postoperative pain has been successfully alleviated by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as meloxicam (<xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">Stewart et&#x000a0;al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">Heinrich et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>), ketoprofen (<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">McMeekan et&#x000a0;al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">Faulkner &#x00026; Weary 2000</xref>) and carprofen (<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">Stilwell et&#x000a0;al. 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite recommendations, pain and distress related to disbudding of calves often remains untreated (<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">Hoe &#x00026; Ruegg 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">Vasseur et&#x000a0;al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Gottardo et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). According to the <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">ALCASDE (2009)</xref>, it is assumed that some kind of medical treatment is administered prior to or after calf disbudding only on 20% of European farms. In Italy, producers reported that 10% of their disbudded calves received local anaesthetics, 4% received a sedative and 5% received analgesics prior to disbudding (<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">Gottardo et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>).

Our hypothesis was that oromucosal detomidine would produce sufficient sedation to allow administration of local anaesthetics with minimum resistance.

The animals were disbudded as a routine measure of the farm. The calves were housed as other calves on the farm, and they were used to human handling. The calves were allocated randomly to one of two groups of 10 animals in each. One group was given sublingually (GEL) detomidine gel (Domosedan Gel 7.6&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> oromucosal gel; Orion Pharma Ltd., Finland) 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>, the other group was given IV detomidine (Domosedan 10&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;mL<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> solution for injection; Orion Pharma Ltd.) 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>.</p><p>Prior to drug administration, the calves were examined clinically and the <italic>V.&#x000a0;cephalica</italic> was cannulated (16&#x000a0;G Intraflon, 1.6&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;60&#x000a0;mm; Vygon, France) for blood sampling. In the IV group, the <italic>V.&#x000a0;jugularis</italic> was also cannulated with a similar catheter for drug administration.

None of the calves substantially resisted infiltration of the local anaesthetic nor reacted to hot cauterization of horn buds. All recoveries were eventless, and no adverse reactions were noted in any of the animals. All calves were able to stand up and walk at the end of the observation period. Rectal temperatures did not differ between the treatments, and hypothermia was not detected.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our results indicated that sublingual administration of detomidine gel prior to infiltration of local anaesthetics was an effective method to sedate healthy calves for disbudding.</p><p>Venous blood from the oral mucosal membrane drains <italic>via</italic> the jugular veins into the systemic circulation, and thus during the absorption phase of the drugs administered by this route, blood from jugular vein may have substantially higher drug concentrations than the mixed blood in systemic circulation (<xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">Messenger et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Therefore plasma drug concentrations analyzed from the jugular vein following sublingual administration may not reflect systemic concentrations. We avoided this bias by collecting blood samples from the veins of extremities (<italic>V.&#x000a0;cephalica</italic>).</p><p>In a previous study (<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">Salonen et&#x000a0;al. 1989</xref>), the pharmacokinetic profile of parenterally administered detomidine in milking cows was close to that of adult horses. In our study, the approximated bioavailability of sublingually administered detomidine in calves (34%) seemed to be relatively similar to the previously reported bioavailability in horses (22%) (<xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Kaukinen et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Our study was not designed to be a pharmacokinetic study, as our primary aim was to evaluate clinical sedation. We collected plasma samples up to 4&#x000a0;hours after drug administration, which probably affected the approximated bioavailability. The elimination phase (&#x000df;-phase) was not attained within the follow up time after sublingual administration, and thus we could not extrapolate the plasma concentration <italic>versus</italic> time curve to infinity.</p><p>As there was a risk that a fraction of the gel dose could be swallowed, we carefully administered the gel under the tongue. The volume of the gel was small (&#x0003c;1&#x000a0;mL <italic>per</italic> calf) and it seemed to remain easily in the oral cavity. Detomidine might undergo extensive first-pass metabolism if swallowed, but the amount of this metabolism is not known in calves. Thus further studies are still needed about the pharmacokinetics of detomidine in calves with this administration route.</p><p>In general, the detomidine induced sedation was equal in both treatment groups. However, maximum sedation was reached earlier in the IV group than in the GEL group. This suggested that 80&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of detomidine administered sublingually was equally potent as 30&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g&#x000a0;kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> of IV administered detomidine. The decrease in heart rate was less intense with sublingual administration than with parenteral administration, as reported earlier also for horses (<xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">Malone &#x00026; Clarke 1993</xref>; <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">Kaukinen et&#x000a0;al. 2011</xref>). Our findings imply that sublingual administration of detomidine would alleviate the decreases in heart rate observed with parenteral administration of detomidine. The efficacy and safety of detomidine after sublingual administration to calves needs further studies in various clinical indications.</p><p>In our study we measured regularly the rectal temperature of the animals. If needed, we used blankets to prevent hypothermia. Thus, hypothermia was not detected. It is important to monitor the body temperature and prevent its reduction in sedated animals as hypothermia affects drug metabolism and prolongs recovery.</p><p>We concluded that oromucosal detomidine gel is an effective sedative for calves prior to infiltration of local anaesthetics and to disbudding. This non-invasive and user-friendly oromucosal sedation method for calves could ease the use of local anaesthetics.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Funding for this study was provided by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in Finland and by Orion Corporation, Orion Pharma Ltd.
