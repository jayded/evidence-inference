Interdisciplinary care consisted of geriatric consultation, discharge planning, and 4&#x000a0;months of in-home rehabilitation. Comprehensive care consisted of interdisciplinary care plus management of malnutrition and depressive symptoms, fall prevention, and 12&#x000a0;months of in-home rehabilitation. Usual care included only in-hospital rehabilitation and occasional discharge planning, without geriatric consultation and in-home rehabilitation. Mental and physical HRQoL were measured at 1, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months after discharge by the physical component summary scale (PCS) and mental component summary scale (MCS), respectively, of the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form 36, Taiwan version.

However, evidence is mixed regarding the effectiveness of interventions to improve the HRQoL of elders with hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]; some studies found beneficial effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and some did not [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>This inconsistency in intervention benefits on HRQoL might have been due to the course of changes in HRQoL after hip fracture being averaged over patients. However, temporal changes in HRQoL for community-dwelling older persons and hospitalized older patients have been shown to be heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, older community-dwelling women were found to have four distinct trajectories of HRQoL, high (19&#x000a0;%), high decline (22&#x000a0;%), intermediate (42&#x000a0;%) and low decline (16&#x000a0;%), over a period of 7&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In another study, hospitalized, frail older persons waiting for entry to residential care had extremely poor HRQoL (worse than death-equivalent) and poor (death equivalent) at both baseline and 4-month follow-up, but with some improvement over the follow-up period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Also, patients who had undergone coronary artery bypass surgery were found to have &#x0201c;improver&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-improver&#x0201d; HRQoL trajectories for both the physical component summary scale (PCS) and the mental component summary scale (MCS) of the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) Short Form 36 (SF-36) during the first year following surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Because patients may have several distinct HRQoL trajectories following hip fracture, intervention effects could vary across these trajectories. In an earlier study of elderly patients with hip fracture, we developed an interdisciplinary care model consisting of geriatric consultation, discharge planning, and 4&#x000a0;months of in-home rehabilitation in addition to usual care and found this model effective in improving HRQoL of older persons with hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Later in a different trial, we refined the interdisciplinary care model by adding management of malnutrition and depressive symptoms as well as fall prevention and 12&#x000a0;months of in-home rehabilitation, thus developing a comprehensive care model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Comparison of the intervention effects of the comprehensive and interdisciplinary care models to usual care showed that both models improved HRQoL of older persons with hip fracture, especially physical health-related outcomes (effect size&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.3, 95&#x000a0;% CI =0.02&#x02013;0.58 at 12&#x000a0;months after discharge) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Analysis of that data was limited by focusing on the average course of changes in HRQoL without exploring whether HRQoL may change along distinct trajectories and whether the intervention effects varied for distinct trajectories. Hence, two research questions remain unanswered: Do patients with hip fracture experience multiple distinct trajectories of HRQoL? If so, what are their levels and rates of change over time? What are the effects of the interdisciplinary care and comprehensive care models compared to usual care on these distinct HRQoL trajectories? To address these questions, we conducted this secondary analysis to identify the distinct courses of change in HRQoL over 1&#x000a0;year after hip-fracture surgery and to analyze the intervention effects on HRQoL trajectories after comprehensive and interdisciplinary care compared to usual care. In particular, we evaluated the following two hypotheses.<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Hypothesis 1 (H<sub>1</sub>): HRQoL, including physical and mental health-related health outcomes, during the first year after hospital discharge following hip fracture has multiple distinct trajectories that can be characterized as poor, moderate, and good [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p></list-item><list-item><p>Hypothesis 2 (H<sub>2</sub>): Receiving the comprehensive and interdisciplinary care models increases patients&#x02019; odds of being in a good physical and good mental health trajectories over time compared with the usual care model.</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Design and setting</title><p>Data for this research came from a randomized control trial conducted from September 2005 to July 2010 at a medical center in northern Taiwan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Subjects</title><p>Patients were included in the original study by these criteria: (a) at least 60&#x000a0;years old, (b) hospitalized for an accidental first time, single-side simple hip fracture and receiving hip arthroplasty or internal fixation, (c) with a pre-fracture Chinese Barthel Index (CBI) score &#x0003e;70 at admission and able to perform full range of motion against gravity and against some or full resistance with the unaffected limb, and (d) living in northern Taiwan. Exclusion criteria were (a) severely cognitively impaired and completely unable to follow orders (determined by a score &#x0003c;10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] on the Chinese Mini-Mental State Examination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]), or (b) terminally ill.</p><p>Of 1246 patients with hip fracture screened, 470 met the study criteria. Among the 776 patients who did not meet our criteria, 409 (52.7&#x000a0;%) had poor pre-fracture physical functioning, 158 (20.4&#x000a0;%) did not live in northern Taiwan, 95 (12.3&#x000a0;%) had severe cognitive impairment, 85 (10.9&#x000a0;%) were unable to communicate, and 29 (3.7&#x000a0;%) lived in a nursing home. Among the 470 patients who met our criteria, 299 agreed to participate. Of these, only 281 had at least one HRQoL assessment. Subjects who had at least one HRQoL assessment and those without any HRQoL data did not differ significantly in gender, age, type of fracture and surgery, and pre-fracture performance of activities of daily living (ADLs). All subjects were assessed for pre-fracture ADL performance before surgery and for HRQoL outcome variables at 1, 3, 6, and 12&#x000a0;months after discharge. The present analysis included 281 subjects (91 comprehensive, 97 interdisciplinary, and 93 usual care) for whom HRQoL data were available during the first year following discharge. The three treatment protocols are briefly described below.

These trajectories are more informative than measures at one or two times and average trajectories derived by hierarchical linear modeling because a significant health difference at one time may diminish or even reverse at a later time, and an average trajectory cannot represent differences in changes over time between subjects. Understanding distinct trajectories in physical and mental HRQoL and exploring intervention effects of different care models on specific trajectories may facilitate improvements in managing subjects following hip fracture.</p><sec id="Sec28"><title>Distinct trajectories of physical and mental HRQoL following hip fracture</title><p>Consistent with our H<sub>1</sub>, both physical and mental HRQoL during the first year after hospitalization for hip fracture followed multiple distinct courses or trajectories that could be characterized as poor, moderate and good trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These trajectories were clinically different, based on the suggested minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for PCS and MCS of 2.5 to 7.8 points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], and that their confidence intervals were not overlapping and the differences among trajectories were&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;10 points. These criteria indicate that the postoperative PCS and MCS trajectories (poor, moderate and good) for older persons with hip fracture differed clinically and represented different patient groups. Distinct trajectories may reflect differences in etiology and thus call for targeted treatments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Natural courses of physical and mental HRQoL following hip fracture</title><p>This study provides significant findings on the natural history of changes in physical and mental HRQoL after hip fracture by quantifying the levels and rates of change in PCS and MCS over 1&#x000a0;year. For PCS, all three trajectories improved over time, whereas for MCS, all three trajectories declined slightly over time during the first year following discharge. Physical HRQoL of older patients with hip fracture has been shown to improve during the first year following discharge, with improvement most rapid during the first 6&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. On the other hand, the slight decline in mental HRQoL is consistent with the high prevalence of depressive symptoms during the first year following hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Intervention effects</title><p>Our study extends the findings of previous randomized controlled trials on older adults with hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] by showing that the intervention effects specifically targeted patients originally in the &#x0201c;poor&#x0201d; PCS trajectory by increasing their likelihood of being in the &#x0201c;good&#x0201d; PCS group. The first trial documented the average beneficial effects of interdisciplinary (referred to as &#x0201c;subacute&#x0201d;) and comprehensive care models on older Taiwanese patients with hip fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The second trial showed that older Norwegian patients with hip fracture had significantly better overall improvements in mobility, ADL performance, and QoL for at least 1&#x000a0;year after surgery after receiving comprehensive orthogeriatric care, including comprehensive geriatric assessment and treatment, early discharge planning, early mobilization, and individualized rehabilitation than their counterparts who received usual care on an orthopedic trauma ward [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Our analysis showed minimal intervention effects on specific MCS trajectories, similar to the averaged intervention effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Our study findings indicate that both the interdisciplinary and comprehensive care models can be implemented specifically for subjects with hip fracture and poor physical HRQoL. Subjects with hip fracture and SF-36 PCS scores&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;40 might benefit most from interdisciplinary subacute care and comprehensive care including geriatric assessment, 1&#x000a0;year of in-home rehabilitation, supported discharge planning, and management of depressive symptoms, malnutrition management, and fall prevention in improving their physical health-related outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Study limitations</title><p>The generalizability of the findings are limited to older patients with hip fracture, but without severe cognitive impairment and relatively independent in pre-fracture performance of ADLs due to our sample inclusion criteria. Another limitation is that our study was single blinded; only subjects and families were blinded to the interventions. A third study limitation is that HRQoL was not assessed at baseline, making it difficult to explore the intervention effects more completely. Lastly, the sample size estimated might not support our current hypotheses, because the sample size estimated primarily based on prior intervention effects on physical HRQoL of the interdisciplinary care. The sample estimation did not consider the intervention effects of a comprehensive care mental health related outcomes. Based on the current results, to make the MCS trajectories significant over 1&#x000a0;year following hospital discharge for comprehensive care model, the sample size calculations for latent class analysis is estimated to be 1424 in the future study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec32"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Changes in postoperative HRQoL for people with hip fracture during the first year following hip fracture can be categorized as poor, moderate and good for both physical and mental HRQoL, with physical HRQoL improving and mental HRQoL declining over time. An interdisciplinary care model that included geriatric assessment, supported discharge planning and 4&#x000a0;months of in-home rehabilitation, and a comprehensive care model including management of malnutrition and depressive symptoms as well as fall prevention in addition to interdisciplinary care effectively improved physical health-related outcomes. In particular, these two care models are especially beneficial for people who originally had poor physical HRQoL (for example, PCS&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;40) in that these models enhanced their chances of having good physical HRQoL. In other words, these models can be used to target people with hip fracture and initially poor physical HRQoL, thus obtaining optimal effects from the intervention. Finally, even though the interdisciplinary care model provided only 4&#x000a0;months of in-home rehabilitation, compared to the 1&#x000a0;year in-home program provided in the comprehensive care model, it was as beneficial as comprehensive care in improving PCS of people with hip fracture.</p><sec id="Sec33"><title>Availability of supporting data</title><p>The datasets supporting the conclusions of this article are not available in an open access repository because the authors have not finished the data analysis yet.
