The objectives of this first-in-patient prospective randomized study were to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the Genoss DES&#x02122; stent in comparison to the Promus Element&#x02122; (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA, USA).</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><sec><title>Patient population</title><p>This study was a prospective, multicenter, single blind (patient blind), randomized study with 1:1 ratio of patients using the Genoss DES&#x02122; stent and Promus Element&#x02122;, conducted from March 2013 to April 2015. The study enrolled 80 patients at 4 Korean centers. Inclusion criteria were the presence of stable angina, unstable angina, or silent ischemia in patients between 20 and 80 years of age. Angiographic inclusion criteria were de novo coronary stenotic lesion with diameter stenosis (DS) &#x0003e;50%, reference vessel diameter (RVD) of 2.5 to 4.0 mm, and a lesion length &#x02264;40 mm. Exclusion criteria were the presence of acute myocardial infarction (MI), cardiogenic shock, low ejection fraction (&#x0003c;40%), contraindication to antiplatelet agents, and chronic total occlusion lesion, restenosis, left main disease, and stenosis of the graft vessel. The protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Ajou University Hospital, Yonsei University Wonju Christian Hospital, Seoul National University Hospital, and Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec><title>The Genoss DES&#x02122; sirolimus-eluting stent</title><p>The Genoss DES&#x02122; is a sirolimus-eluting cobalt-chromium coronary stent system for the treatment of coronary artery diseases. The stent platform features open-cell 2 links with a uniform architecture that permits a high level of flexibility with good radial force, shortening, and conformability. Two kinds of strut thickness (70 and 78 &#x000b5;m) are adopted, depending on the stent diameter (2.25&#x02013;2.50 and 2.75&#x02013;4.00 mm, respectively). To achieve favorable clinical outcomes, the initial burst release of drug from DES is needed to suppress vascular injury and inflammation induced by catheter manipulation and stent implantation. Accordingly, the Genoss DES&#x02122; is designed to release approximately 70% of its initial drug payload (1.15 &#x000b5;g/mm<sup>2</sup>) within the first 30 days following implantation. To achieve the desired drug release profile and minimize the amount of polymer, a 4 &#x000b5;m ultra-thin coating is applied to only the abluminal side of the stent. This bioresorbable coating consists of a proprietary blend of poly-DL-lactide-co-glycolide (PLGA) and poly-DL-lactide (PLA), which are almost fully resorbed within 9 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Study procedure</title><p>PCI was performed using standard interventional techniques. Intravenous heparin was administered to maintain an activated clotting time of more than 250 seconds, and antiplatelet therapy was used before the procedure with aspirin (100&#x02013;325 mg) and clopidogrel (loading dose of 300&#x02013;600 mg) or ticlopidine (500 mg/day). Dual antiplatelet therapy was maintained during the 9 months of follow-up. Glycoprotein IIb/IIIa receptor antagonists were used at the operator's discretion. After predilation, Genoss DES&#x02122;, or Promus Element&#x02122; was implanted under rated burst pressure, and post-dilatation was performed if needed. This study permitted 2 stents to overlap in cases of long lesions.</p></sec><sec><title>Follow-up</title><p>Clinical follow-up was performed at the time of discharge, and following a period of 1, 5, and 9 months. All patients were planned to undergo a follow-up angiography and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) at 9&#x000b1;1 months.</p></sec><sec><title>Quantitative coronary angiography and intravascular ultrasound</title><p>Quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) analyses were performed by 2 independent observers blinded to treatment group using the Cardiovascular Angiography Analysis System II (CAAS II; Pie Medical, Maastricht, Netherlands). The percent DS, minimal luminal diameter, RVD, and lesion length were measured and calculated before the intervention, at the end of the procedure, and at the 9-month follow-up.</p><p>IVUS was performed at the end of the index procedure and at follow-up, and analyzed by 2 independent observers blinded to clinical and procedural information according to the American College of Cardiology clinical expert consensus document on standards for acquisition, measurement, and reporting of IVUS studies.<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11)</xref> All IVUS analyses were performed using computerized planimetry software (EchoPlaque 3.0; Indec Systems, Santa Clara, CA, USA).</p></sec><sec><title>Study endpoints</title><p>The primary endpoint was in-stent late lumen loss at 9-month angiography follow-up determined by QCA. Secondary endpoints were in-segment late lumen loss, binary restenosis rate, death, MI, TLR, target vessel revascularization (TVR), and stent thrombosis during 9-month follow-up.</p></sec><sec><title>Definition</title><p>MI was defined as chest pain and increased creatine kinase-myocardial band level to more than twice the upper limit of the normal range with or without a Q-wave on electrocardiography. Binary restenosis was defined as luminal narrowing of more than 50%, and TLR and TVR were defined as repeated PCI or bypass surgery of a previously stented site or vessel, respectively.

Assuming approximately 10% of patients would drop out, we calculated 40 patients for each group.</p><p>Data are presented as mean&#x000b1;standard deviations for continuous variables, and frequency (percentage) for categorical variables. Comparison of continuous variables was performed using Student's t-test, and &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> or Fisher's exact tests were used for categorical variables. A p value &#x0003c;0.025 was considered statistically significant for the primary endpoint, and &#x0003c;0.050 for the secondary endpoints. Statistical analyses were performed using PASW software (version 18.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Between March 2013 and April 2015, 85 patients were screened for enrollment in the study.

For clinical outcomes, there were no MI or stent thrombosis events during 9-month follow-up. One death occurred in the Genoss DES&#x02122; group due to aggravated renal function 6 months after the index procedure.

multicenter, randomized first-in-patient study showed that in-stent late lumen loss of Genoss DES&#x02122; stents was not inferior to Promus Element&#x02122; stents as determined by QCA at 9-month angiography follow-up. Moreover, there were no differences in clinical outcomes and no stent thrombosis during 9 months of follow-up.</p><p>The Genoss DES&#x02122; stent is the first DES made in Korea. It consists of a cobalt-chromium alloy stent platform, an abluminal coating of bioresorbable polymers, and a drug-eluting coating with sirolimus. Sirolimus is an anti-proliferative and anti-inflammatory agent that inhibits progression from the G1 to the S phase of the cell cycle. Coronary DES using sirolimus has demonstrated good clinical outcomes.<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14)</xref></p><p>For the Genoss DES&#x02122; stent, animal studies using pigs were performed to determine the optimal dose of the drug, comparing high and low doses of sirolimus and paclitaxel (unpublished data). Consequently, sirolimus was loaded on the stent at a concentration of 1.15 &#x000b5;g/mm<sup>2</sup>. The stent was designed to release approximately 70% of the total drug amount within 30 days after implantation. To control the drug release profile, it possesses an ultra-thin (4 &#x000b5;m) bioresorbable layer applied to an abluminal stent surface. This bioresorbable layer consists of a proprietary blend of PLGA and PLA, which are completely resorbable within 6 months, to reduce the possibility of stent thrombosis due to polymer hypersensitivity. In addition, the cobalt-chromium alloy stent platform reduces strut thickness and maximizes flexibility.</p><p>In-stent late luminal loss at 9 months with the Genoss DES&#x02122; stent was 0.11&#x000b1;0.25 mm, comparable with previous DES trials (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). Moreover, this study included a number of patients at high risk of unstable angina or complex lesions. The proportion of patients with unstable angina was around 50% in both groups and that of American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC) type C lesions was 47.4% for the Genoss DES&#x02122; group and 25.6% for the Promus Element&#x02122; group. Angiographic in-stent restenosis was observed in only 2.6% of patients in the Genoss DES&#x02122; group, even though stent overlap was permitted such that mean lesion length was very high (25.5 mm for the Genoss DES&#x02122; group) compared with previous studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T6">Table 6</xref>). Considering patient and angiographic characteristics, in-stent late lumen loss of the Genoss DES&#x02122; stent at 9-month follow-up was acceptable in real clinical practice.</p><table-wrap id="T6" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 6</label><caption><title>Comparison of angiographic outcomes with previous studies</title></caption><alternatives><graphic xlink:href="kcj-47-898-i006"/><table frame="hsides" rules="rows"><col width="36%" span="1"/><col width="32%" span="1"/><col width="32%" span="1"/><thead><tr><th valign="middle" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1"/><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">In-stent late loss (mm)</th><th valign="middle" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Lesion length (mm)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">Platinum QCA<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">0.17&#x000b1;0.25</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">15.4&#x000b1;7.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Nobori 1<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15)</xref></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.11&#x000b1;0.30</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10.56&#x000a0;</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">SPIRIT I<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">0.10&#x000b1;0.21</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">10.1&#x000b1;2.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">RESOLUTE<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17)</xref></td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0.22&#x000b1;0.27</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15.61&#x000b1;6.13</td></tr><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">Genoss DES&#x02122; (current study)</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">0.11&#x000b1;0.25</td><td valign="top" align="center" rowspan="1" colspan="1" style="background-color:rgb(224,222,240)">25.5&#x000b1;8.6</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives><table-wrap-foot><p>Data are shown as mean&#x000b1;standard deviation.</p><p>DES = drug-eluting stent; QCA = quantitative coronary angiography.</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>For clinical outcomes, there were no differences in death, MI, TLR, or TVR between the 2 groups.

For assumptions about sample size, the non-inferiority margin was relatively high and the number of patients was small. This made the statistical power weak. However, the Genoss DES&#x02122; stent showed excellent in-stent late lumen loss compared to current second-generation DESs. In addition, as this is a first-in-patient trial, more studies with larger populations should be conducted in real clinical practice.</p><p>In conclusion, this first-in-patient study of the Genoss DES&#x02122; stent showed excellent angiographic outcomes for in-stent late lumen loss and major adverse cardiac events during the 9-month follow-up.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> This study was supported by Genoss Company Limited (Suwon, Korea).</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> Tahk SJ received research grant from Genoss Compnary Limitied, and other investigators did not have any financial relationships or any other biases or conflicts of interest related with this study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="con"><p><bold>Author Contributions:</bold>
