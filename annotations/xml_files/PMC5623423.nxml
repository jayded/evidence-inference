Some authors suggest a benefit of peripheral nerve block (PNB) in elective procedures, but the different pain profile following acute fracture surgery and the rebound pain on cessation of the PNB both remain unexplored. We present an ongoing randomised study aiming to compare primary PNB anaesthesia with spinal anaesthesia for ankle fracture surgery regarding postoperative pain profiles and quality of recovery.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>AnAnkle Trial is a randomised, dual-centre, open-label, blinded analysis trial of 150 adult patients undergoing primary internal fixation of an ankle fracture. Main exclusion criteria are habitual opioid use, impaired pain sensation, other painful injuries or cognitive impairment. The intervention is ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic (20&#x02009;mL) and saphenal nerve (8&#x02009;mL) PNB with ropivacaine 7.5&#x02009;mg/mL, and controls receive spinal anaesthesia (2&#x02009;mL) with hyperbaric bupivacaine 5&#x02009;mg/mL. Postoperatively all receive paracetamol, ibuprofen and patient-controlled intravenous morphine on demand. Morphine consumption and pain scores are registered in the first 27&#x02009;hours and reported as an integrated pain score as the primary endpoint. Pain score intervals are 3&#x02009;hours and we will use the area under curve to get a longitudinal measure of pain. Secondary outcomes include rebound pain on cessation of anaesthesia, opioid side effects (Opioid-Related Symptom Distress Scale), quality of recovery (Danish Quality of Recovery-15 score) and pain scores and medication days 1&#x02013;7 (diary).</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The study has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committees in the Capital Region of Denmark, the Danish Data Protection Agency and the Danish Health and Medical Authority.

Spinal anaesthesia (SA) is most common, but PNBs are becoming widely implemented, as they provide long-lasting pain control and are regarded very safe.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3&#x02013;7</xref> There is some evidence that PNBs used in elective surgical procedures on knee, ankle and foot are effective in reducing pain, opioid consumption and related side effects such as nausea and vomiting, as well as potentially reducing length of hospital stay and increasing patient satisfaction.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4 8&#x02013;16</xref> However, PNBs can represent a logistical challenge in the acute setting and, moreover, the pain profile following fractures and fracture surgery is naturally different from that of conditions requiring elective surgery.</p><p>Very few studies have investigated the efficacy and possible benefits of PNBs in this context and results are incongruous. One randomised study of postoperative pain scores in ankle fracture surgery showed initial benefit with PNB added to general anaesthesia but also revealed a sizeable &#x02018;rebound pain&#x02019; on cessation of the PNBs, which could challenge the overall benefit on the postoperative pain profile.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Another randomised study of bimalleolar fracture surgery patients showed a longer postoperative effect of PNB anaesthesia compared with SA measured as time to first analgesic request, but pain levels were not measured.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> At our centre, a large retrospective study of postoperative opioid consumption in ankle fracture surgery has suggested that the largest benefit of the regional anaesthesia modalities is obtained with PNBs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, in a prospective exploratory pilot study investigating primary PNB anaesthesia for ankle fracture surgery, we also found a clear indication of rebound pain in relation to cessation of the PNB effect, especially in younger individuals (abstract published).<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>

We did not plan any interim analyses.</p><p>This results in WMW odds=1.75. With a power of 80% (&#x003b2;=20%) and two-sided significance level &#x003b1;=5%, the resulting sample size is 141 patients. Adding 6% to adjust for protocol violations results in a final sample size of 150 (2&#x000d7;75) patients to include.</p><p>We also conducted sample size estimations for the following key secondary outcomes, which were all found to be covered by the set sample size:&#x000a0;numeric rating scale pain score area under the curve (NRS-AUC) for a rebound period of 6&#x02009;hours with 50% intergroup difference;&#x000a0;rebound IPS of 6&#x02009;hours with 30% difference; NRS-AUC of 0&#x02013;27&#x02009;hours with 30% difference; morphine consumption of 0&#x02013;27&#x02009;hours with 30% difference; and quality of recovery score with&#x000a0;10% difference. All outcomes are listed below.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Randomisation and allocation concealment</title><p>Randomisation is externally managed, computer-generated and irreversible. The allocation and participant trial identification number is retrieved via a secured website, with an allocation ratio of 1:1 between PNB and SA. The sequence is stratified by trial centre and patient age group (&#x02264;60 or&#x000a0;&#x0003e;60 years of age) and performed as block randomisation with variable block sizes that are unknown to the investigators to maintain allocation concealment. We thereby follow the International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP) and minimise possible bias from uneven inclusion between centres and age groups with potentially different pain profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Blinding</title><p>The trial is open-labelled. Thus, investigators and participants are not blinded, but data will be blinded by an independent consultant before analysis.</p><p>The difference in anaesthesia application between the groups (spinal in the lower back and PNB at lower thigh level) combined with the characteristic differences in onset and duration of anaesthesia makes blinding of both participants and physicians administering the anaesthesia effectively impossible. PNBs must be administered well before the surgery to ensure sufficient onset time, whereas SA is best administered shortly before surgery to ensure adequate duration. A clear difference in duration of the anaesthesia effect between groups is expected, which renders blinding of data collectors ineffective. Data for the main outcomes are registered directly by the participants (pain scores) or electronically (morphine patient-controlled analgesia&#x000a0;(PCA) pump). Patients do not need to consult with staff to take morphine. The collected data will be anonymised and blinded by an external consultant, not otherwise involved in the trial, before statistical analysis is performed.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Interventions</title><p>Intervention group:&#x000a0;PNB as ultrasound-guided popliteal sciatic nerve block and midfemoral saphenal nerve block with ropivacaine hydrochloride 7.5&#x02009;mg/mL. We use a fixed dose of 20&#x02009;mL (150&#x02009;mg) for the sciatic nerve and 8&#x02009;mL (60&#x02009;mg) for the saphenal nerve to minimise the risk of toxic reactions. Unsuccessful block of a single nerve (tibial, peroneal or saphenal), defined as no effect on sensory function after 40&#x02013;45&#x02009;min or insufficient effect after 60&#x02009;min, is supplemented with an additional dose of 5&#x02009;mL or 10&#x02009;mL provided the patient is weighing 62&#x02013;71&#x02009;kg or&#x000a0;<underline>&#x0003e;</underline>72&#x02009;kg, respectively, thus staying within recommended total dosage of 4&#x02009;mg/kg of ropivacaine.</p><p>Control group:&#x000a0;standard SA using hyperbaric bupivacaine 5&#x02009;mg/mL, 2.0&#x02009;mL.</p><p>Both groups:&#x000a0;small doses of midazolam, propofol or similar can be offered on demand during administration of spinal or PNB anaesthesia to help remedy any anxiety. Both groups will be offered light to moderate sedation during the operation with intravenous&#x000a0;propofol. If necessary, intravenous boluses of short-action opioid such as fentanyl or sufentanil can be administered.</p><p>Standard postoperative pain medication regimen: tablet paracetamol 1000&#x02009;mg &#x000d7;4, tablet ibuprofen 400&#x02009;mg &#x000d7;3 and intravenous morphine via a PCA pump system delivering 2.5&#x02009;mg of morphine on demand with a 6&#x02009;min lockout period.

In parametric models, we may include adjustment for expected heavy confounders, that is, age, diabetes and fracture severity (unimalleolar, bimalleolar or trimalleolar), as this can increase the accuracy of the estimate, even though the groups are expected to be comparable due to randomisation.</p></sec><sec id="s2k3"><title>Subgroup analyses</title><p>Pain experience is known to vary with age and possibly gender.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We have stratified randomisation in two age groups (&#x02264;60 or&#x000a0;&#x0003e;60 years of age) and will perform subgroup analysis on relevant outcomes according to age group and gender.</p></sec><sec id="s2k4"><title>Accountability procedure for missing data for analysis</title><p>Data for the primary outcome are registered from 0 to 27&#x02009;hours from time of anaesthesia.

Due to the complexity of the pain profiles, we intend to publish the results in at least two independent articles, with focus on the primary outcome measure and the secondary measure of rebound pain, respectively.</p><p>All authors must fulfil the criteria of the Vancouver convention.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>Regional anaesthesia is often preferred in ankle fracture surgery due to the superior safety profile and probably better postoperative pain control compared with general anaesthesia.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17 19 33</xref> To the best of our knowledge, AnAnkle Trial is the first study to thoroughly investigate the postoperative pain profile and test which one of the most frequently used regional anaesthesia techniques is superior. Postoperative pain studies are often limited by large time intervals between pain registrations. We designed our trial to avoid this issue since it renders evaluation of the clinical significance of rebound pain impossible, because the rebound could be very intense yet completely undetected in-between pain scorings.</p><p>AnAnkle Trial constitutes a scientifically strong set-up, although blinding of the participants and investigators is not practically possible, which holds a potential risk of bias; for example, reported pain scores might be affected by psychological factors influenced by information from the investigators. To minimise this influence, all pain scores used for the primary outcome are registered by the participants, without consulting the staff. Likewise, the morphine data are gathered electronically from the PCA pump, which the patient activates without consulting the staff, thus ensuring a minimal risk of related bias. Finally, data analysis will be blinded. As in most other clinical trials, there remains a risk of sampling bias due to the eligibility criteria, which might impair the overall generalisability of our results.</p><p>Among the strengths of the design are randomisation and attention to sequence generation and allocation concealment to prevent selection bias between the two groups. The block randomisation and stratification protect against bias from variability of practice during a relatively long inclusion period on different centres. We have chosen a composite score of pain assessment and opioid consumption as primary outcome. The IPS has been thoroughly tested and proven to hold more statistical power than conventional comparisons of pain scores or morphine alone.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> There is a natural correlation between the two that can lead to failure in identifying a true effect, or even lead to finding a false-positive effect, on either outcome, when not balanced by evaluation of the other. In this study we will use the IPS with a longitudinal pain measurement in the form of AUC pain score rather than a single pain rating. This allows us to illustrate the pain profile over time without letting the results be compromised by statistical mass significance. The individual components of the IPS are separately analysed among various secondary endpoints to provide supplementary details to the composite primary endpoint, as is recommended in the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials&#x000a0;(IMMPACT) consensus on pain trials.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
</p><p>If AnAnkle Trial yields clear results, the implications on clinical practice could be profound. Fracture surgery is very common and optimising the choice of anaesthesia will have a major influence on the postoperative recovery and the overall patient course for a very large group of patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e183" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016001.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e184" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-016001.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>We would like to thank Jesper Kent Nielsen, MD, Consultant Anaesthetist, Herlev and Gentofte University Hospital, Herlev, Denmark, and Nicolai Bang Foss, MD, DMSc, Consultant Anaesthetist, Hvidovre and Amager Hospital, Hvidovre, Denmark, for valuable input during idea development and drafting of the protocol.
