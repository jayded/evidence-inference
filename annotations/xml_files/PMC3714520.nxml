SGLT2 is a high-capacity, low-affinity transporter expressed primarily at the luminal membrane of the early segments of the proximal renal tubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). SGLT1 is a low-capacity, high-affinity transporter expressed in the distal segment of the proximal tubule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>), in the intestinal mucosa of the small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>), and in other tissues to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). Although SGLT1 plays a smaller role in renal glucose absorption than SGLT2, SGLT1 is the primary pathway involved in intestinal glucose and galactose absorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>).</p><p>Pharmacologic inhibition of SGLT2 is a novel approach to lowering plasma glucose in hyperglycemic individuals by blocking renal glucose reabsorption, lowering the renal threshold for glucose (RT<sub>G</sub>), and thereby markedly increasing urinary glucose excretion (UGE). Canagliflozin, an SGLT2 inhibitor in development for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>), is also a low-potency SGLT1 inhibitor. In vitro, canagliflozin inhibited sodium-dependent <sup>14</sup>C-&#x003b1;-methylglucoside uptake in cells expressing human SGLT2 or SGLT1 with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 4.4 &#x000b1; 1.2 and 684 &#x000b1; 159 nmol/L, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Because the maximum plasma concentrations of unbound canagliflozin in subjects treated with canagliflozin 300 mg once daily are &#x0223c;100 nmol/L (maximum plasma concentrations are &#x0223c;10 &#x003bc;mol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and protein binding is &#x0223c;99% [unpublished data]), only minimal systemic inhibition of SGLT1 is expected in subjects treated with canagliflozin 300 mg.</p><p>In clinical studies in healthy subjects and subjects with type 2 diabetes, treatment with canagliflozin provided dose-dependent increases in UGE compared with placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). In healthy subjects treated with escalating doses of canagliflozin given 10 min before a mixed meal, doses of canagliflozin higher than 200 mg reduced postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations to a greater extent than lower doses of canagliflozin, even when compared with doses that provided similar UGE during the postprandial period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). These pronounced reductions in postprandial glucose and insulin excursions observed with canagliflozin doses higher than 200 mg were only observed for the first meal after dosing; similar reductions beyond that expected on the basis of increased UGE were not observed after later meals (lunch and dinner) given on the same day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). On the basis of these observations, it was hypothesized that after dosing and during drug absorption, canagliflozin concentrations within the lumen of the intestinal tract could be sufficiently high to provide transient inhibition of intestinal SGLT1-mediated glucose absorption, thereby lowering postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.</p><p>The current study investigated the effects of a single 300-mg oral dose of canagliflozin on intestinal glucose absorption and metabolism in healthy subjects (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01173549). This study used a dual-tracer method to test the hypothesis that canagliflozin 300 mg slows the rate of systemic appearance of orally administered glucose (R<sub>a</sub>O) during a mixed-meal tolerance test (MMTT) compared with placebo.</p><sec id="s1"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s2"><title>Study population</title><p>This study was conducted from 22 November 2010 to 29 September 2011 at a single center in San Diego, California.

This suggests that most of the observed reductions in plasma glucose and insulin excursions with canagliflozin treatment are due to decreased intestinal glucose absorption over the first 2 h after the meal.

The delay in oral glucose absorption is likely due to local and transient intestinal SGLT1 inhibition resulting from high intestinal canagliflozin concentrations within the intestinal lumen during the period of drug absorption.</p><p>Although canagliflozin reduced intestinal glucose absorption by &#x0223c;31% over the first hour and by &#x0223c;20% over the first 2 h after a meal, this initial reduction was almost entirely compensated for by an increase in glucose absorption from 2 to 6 h after the meal. As a result, there was only a small difference (&#x0003c;6%) in the total appearance of orally ingested glucose in plasma over the full 6-h period after the meal between canagliflozin and placebo treatments. These findings demonstrate that canagliflozin treatment is not associated with any meaningful glucose malabsorption, and consistent with this, no symptoms of malabsorption were reported in this study. No increase in glucose malabsorption (assessed using a hydrogen breath test) was observed in subjects with type 2 diabetes treated with canagliflozin 300 mg twice daily for 4 weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). This is in contrast to serious malabsorption symptoms observed in individuals with inactivating genetic mutations in SGLT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>). This lack of glucose malabsorption in subjects treated with canagliflozin is likely due to the rapid absorption of canagliflozin, such that intestinal canagliflozin concentrations are only transiently sufficiently high to inhibit SGLT1.</p><p>The changes in gut peptide secretion observed with canagliflozin treatment are generally consistent with expectations based on intestinal SGLT1 inhibition leading to delayed glucose absorption. GIP-secreting K cells are primarily found in the proximal small intestine, and the observed reduction in plasma GIP concentrations with canagliflozin treatment is consistent with recent data showing that SGLT1-mediated glucose uptake is pivotal for GIP secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). Similarly, the increase in plasma PYY and total GLP-1 observed after <italic>t</italic> = 30 min suggests increased glucose absorption in the more distal intestine where the GLP-1&#x02013;secreting L cells are primarily found. However, it remains uncertain why similarly rapid increases in GLP-1 and PYY were observed in the first 30 min in both treatment groups. The early increments in GLP-1 and PYY (occurring before ingested nutrients have reached the more distal intestine) have been commonly reported in other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>), and the source of this early GLP-1 and PYY secretion remains uncertain, with possibilities including <italic>1</italic>) a neural signal from the proximal small intestine that reaches L cells in the more distal intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>), <italic>2</italic>) release from the small number of L cells in the proximal small intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>), and/or <italic>3</italic>) release by a subset of enteroendocrine cells that cosecrete GIP and GLP-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). Because SGLT1 is also reported to be essential for GLP-1 secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>) and no reduction in early GLP-1 secretion was observed with canagliflozin, it is not clear that the early increment in GLP-1 secretion can be explained by GLP-1 secretion from cells in the proximal small intestine. The observed reduction in serum insulin is likely due to decreased plasma glucose, because the relationship between plasma glucose and the insulin secretion rate was unchanged by canagliflozin treatment (data not shown).</p><p>Although a slight delay in gastric emptying (estimated by plasma acetaminophen concentrations) was observed with canagliflozin treatment compared with placebo, the reductions in R<sub>a</sub>O observed with canagliflozin are greater than can be accounted for by the modest delay in gastric emptying. The observed effects of canagliflozin on R<sub>a</sub>O are consistent with the hypothesis that canagliflozin 300 mg transiently inhibits intestinal SGLT1-mediated glucose absorption, with perhaps a small contribution of delayed gastric emptying, possibly related to the increased GLP-1 levels.</p><p>Endogenous glucose production was suppressed to a similar extent with both treatments after the meal, but EGP was higher with canagliflozin than with placebo over the 3- to 6-h period after the meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The elevated EGP is likely a compensatory response that enables normal plasma glucose concentrations to be maintained in the presence of sustained UGE, but the mechanism(s) leading to the increased EGP is not known.</p><p>Although this study demonstrated that a single 300-mg dose of canagliflozin delays intestinal glucose absorption in healthy subjects, there are some important limitations. Because only one dose strength of canagliflozin was tested, the dose-response relationship for the effect of canagliflozin on intestinal glucose absorption cannot be established from this study. Results from an earlier study suggested that doses &#x0003e;200 mg of canagliflozin were required to see pronounced reductions in postprandial glucose excursions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>), but it is not known whether greater delays in intestinal glucose absorption could be achieved with higher doses of canagliflozin or whether malabsorption would be observed with higher doses. In addition, because this mechanistic study only characterized the response to a single dose in healthy subjects, further studies will be required to characterize the effects of sustained canagliflozin treatment on intestinal glucose absorption in subjects with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>In conclusion, canagliflozin 300 mg reduces postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentration in healthy subjects by two distinct mechanisms: <italic>1</italic>) increasing UGE due to renal SGLT2 inhibition and <italic>2</italic>) delaying R<sub>a</sub>O, which is likely due to transient intestinal SGLT1 inhibition.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
