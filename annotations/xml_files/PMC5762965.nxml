Study participants were identified among recipients of kidney transplantations ages 18 years or older with SHPT who at the baseline evaluation fulfilled the following selection criteria: written informed consent; serum iPTH levels between 250 and 600 pg/ml in the 24 hours before the transplantation; panel of preformed antibodies&#x000a0;&#x0003c;20% in the 24 hours before the transplantation or considered by the investigator to be a low immunological risk; serum calcium (corrected for albumin)&#x000a0;&#x0003c;10 mg/dl in the 24 hours before the transplantation; and receiving standard immunosuppressive treatment with basiliximab, tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, or mycophenolic acid and steroids. No change in the immunosuppressive regimen was allowed throughout the whole study period. Main exclusion criteria were &#x0003e;1 previous kidney transplantation, positive crossmatch, ABO incompatible transplantation, patients who received cinacalcet 48 hours before transplantation, and patients with any active viral infection. Use of cinacalcet, biphosphonates, and/or any type of vitamin D apart from the study medication was not allowed during the study. Women of child-bearing potential were tested for pregnancy at screening visit and were informed to avoid pregnancy during the study. Patients who did not meet inclusion and/or exclusion criteria after the screening period were considered to be a screening failure and were not included in the statistical analysis.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.2"><title>Study Groups</title><p id="p0040">An algorithm was used to generate random numbers by computer for a simple randomization; patients who satisfied the inclusion and/or exclusion criteria were assigned sequentially at a 1:1 ratio to the PAR or the CAL group. The PAR group was treated with oral PAR (Zemplar, Abbvie Inc., North Chicago, Illinois). The starting dose of PAR was 1 &#x003bc;g/d, but this dose could be adjusted based on the serum iPTH and serum calcium levels (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;S1</xref>). Briefly, the&#x000a0;PAR dose was increased to 2 &#x003bc;g/d if iPTH was &#x0003e;110 pg/ml and calcium was&#x000a0;&#x02264;10 mg/dl. PAR dose was reduced to 1 &#x003bc;g every other day if iPTH was&#x000a0;&#x02264;110 pg/ml and calcium was &#x0003e;10.3 mg/dl. PAR was discontinued if calcium was&#x000a0;&#x0003e;10.3 mg/dl and iPTH was &#x0003e;110 pg/ml. The&#x000a0;CAL&#x000a0;group was treated with oral CAL (Hidroferol, FAES Farma, Madrid, Spain). The starting dose was 5&#x000a0;drops/d (20 &#x003bc;g or 1200 IU), and the maintenance dose was adjusted based on the 25(OH)D levels (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Supplementary Figure&#x000a0;S2</xref>). Study medication was started in the first 7 days post-transplantation as soon as the patient satisfied the eligibility criteria and was continued up to 6 months post-transplantation. Dose adjustments of the study medications were performed at months 1 and 3. During the randomization process, patients were stratified based on if the patient was a first-time recipient of a kidney or if the patient had already had a previous kidney transplantation.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.3"><title>Primary and Secondary Efficacy Endpoints</title><p id="p0045">The primary outcome of this study was to demonstrate the superiority of PAR treatment at early renal post-transplantation in the control of iPTH (percentage of patients with serum iPTH &#x0003e;110 pg/ml at 6 months) compared with the use of CAL. Secondary objectives were changes on bone turnover biomarkers and BMD, the effect on recipient alloimmune response (clinical and subclinical acute rejection, <italic>de novo</italic> donor-specific antibodies, parameters of renal function, blood pressure and pulse-wave velocity, and acute (subclinical rejection and borderline changes) and chronic (interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy [IFTA]) allograft damage and calcification (in hematoxylin and eosin stained samples) in the 6-month protocol biopsy. The assessment of serum iPTH, CAL, calcium, phosphorus, FGF23, and bone turnover biomarkers was performed in a central laboratory. A pathologist who was unaware of study groups diagnosed protocol biopsies. From a safety point of view, the frequency of adverse events related to treatment with PAR and CAL, and the incidence of adverse effects that required treatment discontinuation between the 2 arms were evaluated.</p></sec><sec id="sec1.4"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p id="p0050">Continuous variables with normal or symmetrical distribution were reported as mean &#x000b1; SDs. The categorical variables were described with frequencies and percentages. The differences between the 2 groups for continuous variables were analyzed using Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test or the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, as appropriate. The differences between categorical variables were analyzed using the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> distribution and Fisher exact test, as appropriate. All statistical tests were considered significant if the <italic>P</italic> value was&#x000a0;&#x0003c;0.05 for 2-tailed tests. The primary efficacy variable was analyzed using the intention-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol approach. Statistical analysis was performed with the SAS program (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina). All safety analyses were conducted on the ITT data sheet using the MedRA code and classifying them as an adverse event or serious adverse event.</p><p id="p0055">The study sample size was calculated based on previous publications on the effect of PAR on bone mineral metabolism in stage 3 and 4 CKD patients. It was assumed that the difference between the arm treated with PAR versus the arm treated with CAL in the proportion of patients with iPTH &#x0003e;110 pg/ml would be 20%. It was expected that the percentage of patients treated with PAR compared with those who received CAL with iPTH &#x0003e;110 pg/ml would be 20% and 40%, respectively. Based on this assumption and using the Fisher exact test with a 2-tailed significance level of 0.05 and a power of 80%, the sample size would be 90 patients per treatment group, for a total of 180 patients. The planned recruitment period was 12 months (between January 2014 and December 2014) and then extended until February 2015 due to the low recruitment rate. Recruitment was stopped on February 2015, after including 148 screened patients. The reason was budget limitations related to the nature of the funding source.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>Study Population</title><p id="p0060">Of 148 screened participants, 48 patients were excluded because they did not fulfill the inclusion criteria, 2 patients decided not to participate in the study, and 4&#x000a0;patients were excluded for other reasons.

Although the primary endpoint explored vitamin D pleiotropic effects, there was a secondary endpoint to assess changes in BMD and bone fractures at 2 years. Further studies with more prolonged follow-up are required to assess the effects of both PAR and vitamin D replenishment on BMD and bone fractures.</p><p id="p0110">FGF23 and PTH regulate each other in a negative feedback loop, in which PTH stimulates FGF23 synthesis and FGF23 suppresses iPTH production action by the Klotho-FGFR1 complex in the parathyroid gland.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, in CKD, reduced Klotho accounts for high iPTH despite elevated FGF23. After transplantation, FGF23 levels can remain elevated for months despite restored renal function, and, in combination with high iPTH, these levels might contribute to inappropriately low levels of calcidiol.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> High levels of FGF23 have been associated with endothelial dysfunction, volume overload, and an increased risk of cardiovascular mortality.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> In our study, the reduction of FGF23 seemed higher in the CAL group than in the PAR group. Experimental data suggest that VRDAs could increase FGF23. Recently, Donate-Correa <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic><xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr"><sup>31</sup></xref> found that PAR treatment in prevalent kidney transplants with SHPT was associated with an increased Klotho, reduced iPTH, and increased FGF23. However, more studies are needed to investigate whether PAR and vitamin D replenishment induce different effects on the imbalanced FGF23-PTH-vitamin D axis.</p><p id="p0115">We also investigated some of the pleiotropic effects attributed to PAR.<xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr"><sup>32</sup></xref> In particular, we monitored immune response in a homogenous cohort that received basiliximab induction therapy, tacrolimus, mycophenolate, and prednisone immunosuppression. The incidence of both clinical and subclinical acute rejection was low, in line with the results achieved with current immunosuppression in the low immunological risk population.<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr"><sup>33</sup></xref> There were no differences between PAR and CAL regarding rejection and <italic>de novo</italic> donor-specific antibody development. These findings suggested that PAR, in comparison with nutritional vitamin D replenishment, was not associated with a higher prevention of immunologically mediated allograft damage.</p><p id="p0120">We found that PAR treatment was associated with lower GFR than CAL, whereas proteinuria levels were similar. Although unexpected, these results were consistent with a previous study carried out in prevalent renal transplant recipients with SHPT. Trillini <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic><xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> suggested that decreased creatinine tubular secretion, increased creatinine generation, or both, could explain this finding because VDRAs did not affect inulin clearance, which is the gold standard for measuring GFR. However, in agreement with a lower eGFR, we also found a higher proportion of chronic renal allograft lesions (IFTA) in 6-month protocol biopsies in patients treated with PAR. This finding was an apparent discrepancy with a previous study that compared PAR versus placebo, in which PAR was associated with reduced moderate IFTA in protocol biopsies.<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> Because our study was the first to compare PAR with vitamin D replenishment and took previous studies into account, our results suggested that the observed differences in kidney function and renal damage might rely on the beneficial effect of vitamin D replenishment rather that on the nephrotoxicity of PAR. It was reported that vitamin D downregulated renin expression, transforming growth factor &#x003b2;1 and tubulointerestitial fibrosis in animal models of kidney damage.<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr"><sup>34</sup></xref> This effect could be particularly relevant in our cohort of patients with a high proportion of transplanted kidneys from older donors. The ongoing VITA-D (the cholecalciferol substitution in vitamin D deficient kidney transplant recipients) study will provide further information regarding the immunomodulatory and renoprotective effects of cholecalciferol in renal allograft recipients with vitamin D deficiency.<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr"><sup>35</sup></xref> In contrast, tubulointerstitial calcifications in protocol biopsies were rare and only observed in 1 patient treated with PAR. Thus, renal calcification did not seem to be associated with the eGFR differences between groups.</p><p id="p0125">The cause of posttransplantation proteinuria could be multifactorial, including immunological and nonimmunological factors. Many studies suggested that PAR reduces albuminuria in kidney transplantations, although the mechanism accounting for this effect is not clear.<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> Nevertheless, Amer <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic><xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> reported similar proteinuria in a clinical trial that compared PAR versus placebo in incident renal allograft recipients. Our results were concordant with this study and showed that PAR and vitamin D replenishment had a similar effect on the level of proteinuria and albuminuria observed after transplantation.</p><p id="p0130">In CKD patients, vitamin D is considered protective against cardiovascular disease (CVD).<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Vitamin D is an endocrine suppressor of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr"><sup>36</sup></xref> Although CVD is the main cause of mortality in renal transplantation, few studies have reported an association between vitamin D deficiency and mortality in this population.<xref rid="bib1" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> In this regard, the short-term follow-up in our study was a limitation to assess CVD. To estimate cardiovascular risk, we measured changes in arterial stiffness and blood pressure. Experimental studies suggested that PAR is superior to doxercalciferol to prevent vascular calcification and arterial stiffness in uremic rats.<xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr"><sup>37</sup></xref> Lundwall <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic><xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr"><sup>38</sup></xref> found that PAR was able to reduce pulse-wave velocity and to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction in CKD patients. These results were not confirmed in our study because we found similar blood pressure and arterial stiffness in patients treated with PAR and CAL.</p><p id="p0135">Overall, treatment was well tolerated with few episodes of hypercalcemia. Despite a slight trend to more serious and nonserious adverse events with PAR therapy, all treatment-related adverse events were nonserious and generally mild; patients fully recovered after treatment withdrawal. Our study had some limitations and strengths. Limitations were sample size because the enrollment goal was not achieved, short-term follow-up, absence of 25(OH)D3 assessment in the PAR group, and lack of preimplantation renal biopsies. Some of these limitations were caused by budget constraint related to the academic nature of the study. Regarding 25(OH)D3, it seems likely that, without supplementation, the calcidiol levels remained low, as demonstrated by Perrin <italic>et&#x000a0;al.</italic><xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr"><sup>39</sup></xref> Nevertheless, this was the first clinical trial that compared PAR with CAL in <italic>de novo</italic> kidney&#x000a0;allograft recipients with a clinically relevant degree&#x000a0;of SHPT before transplantation. Major strengths were study design, a homogeneous and representative kidney transplant population with pretransplantation SHPT, homogeneous immunosuppression, protocol biopsies, and assessment of donor-specific antibodies.</p><p id="p0140">In conclusion, in <italic>de novo</italic> kidney transplantation recipients with SHPT, both PAR and vitamin D replenishment reduced iPTH at 6 months after transplantation. However, PAR treatment was associated with a higher proportion of patients with iPTH&#x000a0;&#x0003c;70 pg/ml, higher FGF23, lower eGFR, and more IFTA in 6-month protocol biopsies. Although these results should be interpreted with caution due to statistical power limitation, they did not support the use of PAR to treat posttransplantation hyperparathyroidism. Long-term controlled clinical trials are needed to corroborate our short-term findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec4"><title>Disclosure</title><p id="p0145">All the authors declared no competing
