Among their pleiotropic effects, inhibition of pathogen colonization at the mucosal surface as well as modulation of immune responses are widely recognized as the principal biological activities of probiotic bacteria. In recent times, the immune effects of probiotics have led to their application as vaccine adjuvants, offering a novel strategy for enhancing the efficacy of current vaccines. Such an approach is particularly relevant in regions where infectious disease burden is greatest and where access to complete vaccination programs is limited. In this study, we report the effects of the probiotic, <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG (LGG) on immune responses to tetanus, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b (Hib) and pneumococcal conjugate (PCV7) vaccines in infants. This study was conducted as part of a larger clinical trial assessing the impact of maternal LGG supplementation in preventing the development of atopic eczema in infants at high-risk for developing allergic disease. Maternal LGG supplementation was associated with reduced antibody responses against tetanus, Hib, and pneumococcal serotypes contained in PCV7 (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;31) compared to placebo treatment (<italic>N</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;30) but not total IgG levels. Maternal LGG supplementation was also associated with a trend to increased number of tetanus toxoid-specific T regulatory in the peripheral blood compared to placebo-treated infants. These findings suggest that maternal LGG supplementation may not be beneficial in terms of improving vaccine-specific immunity in infants. Further clinical studies are needed to confirm these findings. As probiotic immune effects can be species/strain specific, our findings do not exclude the potential use of other probiotic bacteria to modulate infant immune responses to vaccines.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>LGG</kwd><kwd>probiotic</kwd><kwd>pneumococcal</kwd><kwd>Treg</kwd><kwd>immune modulation</kwd></kwd-group><counts><fig-count count="6"/><table-count count="7"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="54"/><page-count count="12"/><word-count count="9110"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="S1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The success of vaccination as a public health measure is best illustrated by the substantial reductions in rates of infectious diseases such as smallpox, polio, tetanus, and diphtheria following the introduction of these vaccines in the early part of the nineteenth century (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>). Since that time, vaccination remains one of the most cost-effective health care intervention tools, and global vaccination rates are above 80% in most developed countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>). The efficacy of vaccines is the result of a combination of factors that include the effectiveness of the specific vaccine, the type of adjuvant included in the vaccine and the achievement of vaccine delivery (completion of recommended schedule) which is in turn influenced by cost and feasibility of route of administration. The term adjuvant comes from the latin &#x0201c;<italic>adjuvare</italic>&#x0201d; meaning &#x0201c;to help.&#x0201d; Adjuvants are critical components of vaccines as they help the immune system respond to the vaccine by several proposed mechanisms such as immunomodulation, cytokine regulation as well as depot formation, which allows for sustained release at the site of injection to maintain a continual source of immune stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>).</p><p>Despite these achievements, there are a number of significant challenges that remain. In particular, many children (and adults) living in developing countries still die from vaccine-preventable diseases such as tetanus, pneumococcal disease and rotavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>). In the last 10&#x02009;years, international organizations such as the GAVI Alliance have made a profound impact on child health by improving access and delivery of these life-saving vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Continued effort is required to reduce the burden of infectious disease in these settings and it is likely that the combination of increased vaccine coverage as well as the development of novel vaccines and adjuvants will be critical in reducing vaccine-preventable disease globally.</p><p>The identification of novel vaccine adjuvants have been the subject of intense scientific research over many decades. Particularly important is their activity at the mucosal surface as well as their ability to target both systemic and mucosal immunity, since most infections occur via the mucosal surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>). Protection by current vaccines typically relies on recommended schedules that consist of multiple dosing over the first 1&#x02013;2&#x02009;years of life. In resource-limited settings, this represents significant challenges in terms of cost and delivery. Adjuvants demonstrated to enhance immunological activity may allow for reduced vaccine dosing in these regions and could be given earlier to protect infants against initial colonization by pathogenic bacteria such as the pneumococcus. The mechanisms of action of current human approved adjuvants such as alum are controversial and have several limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). Many candidate adjuvants have been studied, but only very few are approved for human use due to toxicity issues or a lack of immunogenicity. Therefore, novel adjuvants that can overcome these limitations are required. In recent times, the use of probiotic bacteria as immunomodulators has been investigated owing to their pleiotropic biological effects. Probiotics are defined as &#x0201c;live micro-organisms which when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host&#x0201d; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). The immunomodulatory activities of probiotic bacteria make them potentially useful candidates as novel adjuvants for human vaccines that require further research.</p><p>The most well characterized probiotics include those of the <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> or <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). These probiotics have been shown to be safe in humans and animals in a number of studies. In particular, the probiotic <italic>Lactobacillus rhamnosus</italic> GG (LGG) is reported to have a number of immune-modulating effects, including cytokine responses, enhancing protective IgG and IgA levels as well upregulating certain immune cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). Moreover, LGG has been reported in a limited number of studies to enhance certain vaccine-specific responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Maternal intervention has been one approach to investigate the potential beneficial effects of probiotics such as LGG on increasing early-life protection. In this study, we examined the capacity for the probiotic LGG to enhance immune responses in infants that were part of a larger phase II maternal LGG intervention study for the prevention of allergic disease. Responses to the common childhood vaccines tetanus, <italic>Haemophilus influenzae</italic> type b and the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) were measured as well as total IgG levels.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="S2-1"><title>Study samples</title><p>Plasma and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) samples used in this study were collected from infants of mothers (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;250) that were part of a randomized controlled trial of prenatal LGG for the prevention of eczema (Probiotic Eczema Prevention Study registered with Cochrane Skin Group <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/ongoingskintrials">www.nottingham.ac.uk/ongoingskintrials</uri> Trial No. 36) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).

It was found that the IgG response to TT and PCV7 vaccines was significantly lower amongst infants of mothers treated with LGG during pregnancy. However no effects on the IgG response to Hib vaccine were observed. Moreover, total IgG levels were similar across the groups, and consistent with previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>), suggesting that maternal LGG may be able to modulate, directly or indirectly, specific immune responses in the infants. This is the first study to examine this immune-modulating potential of LGG when administered to mothers during pregnancy and includes a comprehensive evaluation of the immune response to a broad range of vaccine antigens.</p><p>In our study, LGG reduced the antibody response to all vaccines studied, with significant reductions observed for TT and four of seven PCV7 serotypes (4, 18C, 19F, and 23F). There was also a reduced proportion of infants with protective IgG levels (&#x02265;0.35&#x02009;&#x003bc;g/ml) to several PCV7 serotypes at 12&#x02009;months of age. The effect of LGG on the anti-TT response was also associated with increased numbers of TT-specific Treg, although this was not statistically significant. The higher number of Treg &#x02013; but not percentage of Treg in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population &#x02013; is most likely a reflection of the significantly higher number and proportion of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the LGG group compared to placebo. These data suggest that LGG may induce Th1 responses that are transferred to these allergic infants in early life, consistent with LGG&#x02019;s reported effects in allergy involving upregulated TT-specific CD4<sup>+</sup> Treg which may explain the lower TT-specific IgG levels observed in this study. In addition, the elevated (non-significant) TGF-&#x003b2; levels in PBMC supernatants from infants in the LGG group also provide further support for a possible Treg-mediated effect for TT. It is possible that the relatively small sample size in this study may have precluded our ability to detect any real differences by LGG.</p><p>The infants in this study were part of a larger randomized, placebo-controlled trial for eczema prevention (termed PEPS) and were considered &#x0201c;high-risk&#x0201d; for the development of allergic disease. Maternal LGG supplementation in this study was not able to prevent the development of eczema in infants by 12&#x02009;months of age compared to placebo treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>).</p><p>However, in this study, more infants had reported eczema or atopy in the LGG group compared to placebo and it is possible that the LGG effect on vaccine responses were in part due to their allergic status. In allergy, the immune system is dysregulated with a predominately Th2-biased response characterized by increased levels of IgE and cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-13 while IgG levels and Th1 cytokines such as IFN-&#x003b3; are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>). A shift toward Th2-based IgE responses in allergy is known to downregulate Th1-based IgG levels &#x02013; which are typically induced following vaccination &#x02013; and so it may be possible that the vaccine-specific responses seen in the LGG group were a result of their allergic status rather than the probiotic itself. No differences were observed in relation to the Th1:Th2 balance between these groups despite a trend toward higher levels of the regulatory cytokine TGF-&#x003b2; in the LGG group. However, following adjustment for eczema status and atopy, this effect for LGG persisted, indicating that allergic status did not bias these results. It is therefore likely that the effect of LGG was related to an induction of maternal tolerogenic responses that were transferred to the infant. The fact that maternal LGG did not reduce total IgG levels in the infant provides further support to the ability of LGG to modulate certain antigen-specific responses. The IgG response to an unrelated (non-vaccine) antigen was not undertaken in this study but is expected to be low in this cohort given the age of the infants and the relative lack of exposure to antigens other than those in the vaccines. This is best illustrated for pneumococcal vaccination, whereby infants previously given three doses of PCV7 during infancy produce elevated IgG responses to vaccine serotypes but not non-vaccine serotypes at 12&#x02009;months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>). Furthermore, the use of total IgG as a non-vaccine antigen control for TT-responses has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>).</p><p>There are several mechanisms by which probiotics mediate their tolerogenic effects which may help to explain our results observed. A number of studies have reported that probiotics such as LGG are able to increase the number and function of allergen-specific Treg in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). This may occur through direct cell-cell contact or via the release of regulatory cytokines such as TGF-&#x003b2; and IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>) and are critical for the control of immune-mediated diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and have been reported to correlate with the amelioration of clinical allergy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>). Maternal supplementation with probiotics has been shown to induce immunomodulatory effects in infants via cord blood, breast milk, or indirectly through changes to intestinal microbiota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>). We recently reported that LGG reduced the levels of TGF-&#x003b2; and total IgA in breast milk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>) which may explain the lack of effect against allergic disease. It is possible that the maternal LGG was transferred to the infants in this study resulting in changes to the intestinal microbiome. It is now known that the microbiome is a critical factor in shaping the infant immune system by providing essential signals that drive healthy immune development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>).</p><p>Probiotics have also been increasingly used as a strategy to restore intestinal dysbiosis that is associated with allergic disease. Early-life interactions between intestinal microbiota and the immune system is critical for the development of a healthy immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>). Altered microbiota containing fewer beneficial bacteria are suggested to provide inappropriate signals to mucosal immune cells leading to aberrant inflammatory responses and a loss of immune regulation. Studies have reported that prenatal and/or postnatal probiotic treatment with various <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> and <italic>Bifidobacterium</italic> species improved microbiota patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>). Moreover, data from meta-analyses on the ability of probiotics to prevent allergic diseases are inconclusive, owing predominately to the heterogeneity in the study designs and probiotic used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>). However, prenatal probiotic treatment has shown the most promise in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>), suggesting that early-life signals are important in immune development. It is possible that LGG transfer from mother to infant may explain the immunomodulatory effect for LGG in this study. Indeed, in the PEPS study, maternal supplementation with LGG increased the numbers of the beneficial bacteria <italic>B. longum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>) which are important for healthy immune development. Investigations are currently ongoing as to whether the presence of <italic>B. longum</italic> influenced the Th1:Th2 balance in these infants at 12&#x02009;months of age. It is possible that such early-life influences on microbiota may impact on the immune response to vaccines, particularly in the first 6&#x02009;months of life. Indeed, it is now recognized that the intestinal microbiome should be considered when developing vaccines specific for certain geographical regions and populations since vaccine efficacy may vary based on the microbial composition of the gastrointestinal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>).</p><p>More recently, the use of probiotics as novel vaccine adjuvants has been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>). Infants treated with LGG at 2&#x02013;5&#x02009;months of age had an elevated (but not significant) serum IgA and IgM response following an oral rotavirus vaccine, as well as significantly higher numbers of rotavirus-specific IgM secreting cells compared to placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>). LGG was also shown to enhance neutralizing antibody titers as well as serum poliovirus-specific IgG and IgA in adults immunized with the trivalent oral polio vaccine (OPV) compared to placebo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>). In another study, a greater proportion of LGG-treated adults had higher numbers of Typhi-specific IgA secreting cells (ASCs) following oral <italic>S. typhi</italic> Ty21a immunization despite no differences in the specific antibody response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>). In addition, probiotics have been shown to elicit adjuvant properties following immunization with other vaccines such as influenza (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>), Hep B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>), and polio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>).</p><p>The identification of novel adjuvants that can be administered in early-life would provide a substantial benefit in settings of high infectious disease burden. The contribution of the pneumococcus, Hib, and tetanus to neonatal and infant mortality is considerable, with more than two million deaths each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B52">52</xref>). Furthermore, in developing countries, vaccine delivery is a significant problem where access to complete vaccination schedules is limited or where drop-out rates are high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B53">53</xref>). Therefore probiotics potentially offer substantial advantages as vaccine adjuvants in terms of safety, ease of administration and their demonstrated ability to enhance immune responses. The reduced proportion of protective antibody levels in the LGG group may pose a theoretical increased risk of disease susceptibility which would be particularly important in high burden of disease settings. However, as this study was not designed to specifically address the effect of probiotics on vaccine responses, further large scale randomized trials are required to fully evaluate this effect.</p><p>A major strength of this study is the comprehensive evaluation of LGG&#x02019;s capacity to modulate infant vaccine responses following maternal supplementation, involving pneumococcal, Hib, and TT-specific immune responses. In addition, this is one of the first studies to describe the adjuvant effect of probiotics for PCV7 using WHO-based assays. However, several limitations need to be addressed. This is a relatively small cohort and so caution must be applied when considering the results of this study. The effect of multiple comparison testing cannot be excluded and in this study was not performed due to the small sample size. Furthermore, this study may not be adequately powered to detect a beneficial impact of LGG on infant vaccine responses given the primary outcome was clinical allergy at 12&#x02009;months of age. Also, maternal LGG supplementation may not be as effective as a combined prenatal/postnatal or postnatal alone approach for examination of the infant immune response to vaccines as has been shown for studies of allergic disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>). Moreover, all vaccinations were administered as part of the 3-dose National Immunization Program in Australia which might not be optimal to detect any differences in these responses, as all recipients would be expected to respond robustly to this schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B54">54</xref>). Examination of earlier post-vaccination time-points may have potentially revealed important differences by LGG. It is also possible that probiotics other than LGG may be more beneficial in this setting since it is known that the activities of probiotics are dependent on the species and strain used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Subsequent studies in a larger healthy cohort will be important in understanding the potential benefits of probiotics in modulating vaccine-specific immune responses during early-life.</p></sec><sec id="S5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The probiotic LGG was found to reduce the antibody levels specific for TT, PCV7, and Hib but not total IgG in infants at 12&#x02009;months of age who were part of a maternal supplementation trial for the prevention of allergic disease. These results suggest that this probiotic may not be beneficial in relation to improving vaccine-specific responses in these infants. Various factors may have impacted on this response such as the nature of the cohort, timing of probiotic administration, or the probiotic itself. Therefore additional studies that are designed to specifically address these questions will be of significant interest, particularly in settings of high infectious disease burden and where access to complete vaccine schedules is limited.</p></sec><sec id="S6"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The studies were funded by grants from the Jack Brockhoff Foundation, the Murdoch Childrens Research Institute, the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) and the Ilhan Food Allergy Foundation.
