This study tested the hypothesis that ACE inhibition enhances fibrinolysis and inflammation to greater extent than ARB in patients undergoing CPB.One week to five days prior to surgery, patients were randomized to ramipril 5mg/day,candesartan 16mg/day or placebo.ACE inhibition increased intraoperative bradykinin and tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) concentrations compared to ARB. Both ACE inhibition and ARB decreased plasma transfusion compared to placebo, but only ACE inhibition decreased length of stay. Neither ACE inhibition nor ARB significantly affectedplasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, or IL-10 concentrations.

This finding may be explained by a difference in study methodologies. The current clinical trial included mostly valve surgery patients randomized to a single fixed dose ACE inhibitor, whereas in our previous studies(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>) patients were on chronic diverse ACE inhibitor therapies at different doses before they were randomized to either continue or discontinue their current ACE inhibitor therapy.Even though the dose of ACE inhibitor may affect the PAI-1 response (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>) the HEART study investigators(<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>)reported that both low-dose and full-dose ramipril decreases PAI-1 to a similar extent.The dose of ramipril in this study, although not the maximum dose, was sufficient to suppress ACE activity compared toplacebo and ARB groups. We cannot exclude the possibility that our results may have been different if we studied only patients on chronic ACE inhibitor therapy.Taken together with prior studies, the current study suggests that short-term ACE inhibition does not affect the PAI-1 response, whereas withdrawal of chronic ACE inhibitionmay lead to an increased PAI-1 response following CPB.The effect of ARB on the fibrinolytic response following CPB has not been studied. ARB treatment did not affect PAI-1 concentrations. The lack of effect of ARB on the fibrinolytic response may be attributable to non-AT<sub>1</sub> receptor subtypes mediating the effect of angiotensinII on endothelial PAI-1 expression.(<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>)Consistent with our previous studiesperioperative ACE inhibition increases t-PA during cardiac surgery.(<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>)</p></sec><sec id="S10"><title>Inflammatory Response</title><p id="P16">CPB was associated with a significant increase in postoperative inflammatory markers.

In another study ARB tended to decrease IL-6 concentrations following CPB surgery.(<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>)Comparison of our findings to these studies isdifficult because of study methodology differences. For example, the study by Radaelli et al(<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>)included predominantly male CABG surgery patients and only demonstrated inflammation attenuation with high-dose ACE inhibitorplus high-dose statintherapy, and this effect did not persistsix hours after cross-clamp removal. Our study population on the other hand underwent more diverse surgeryand statin use was not randomized. Despite our use of a lower dose of ramipril, ACE activity was significantly suppressed with this dose. The majority of the postoperative IL-6 variability observed in our study was secondary to duration of CPB, aorticcross-clamping, type of surgery, and administration of steroids. Including these variables in the mixed effects model still did not reveal any effect of renin-angiotensin blockade on the inflammatory response.</p><p id="P17">Bradykinin concentrations were measured to investigate the contributions of bradykinin to the inflammatory response because bradykinin has been shown to increase circulating IL-6,(<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>)and ACE inhibition and to a lesser extent ARB increase bradykinin concentrations by decreasing bradykinin metabolism.(<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>)As expected, ACE inhibition increased bradykinin concentrations(<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>)and although increased bradykinin correlated with increased t-PA concentrations in our study, there were no significant associationsamong bradykinin and inflammatory marker concentrations. Ongoing studies of perioperative bradykinin receptor antagonist (NCT00223704) usewill help elucidate the role of bradykinin in postoperative inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="S11"><title>Clinical Outcomes</title><p id="P18">In the current studywe made the additional observation that increased markers of intraoperative fibrinolysis are not necessarily associated with increased postoperative blood loss or blood product exposure risk. In fact, ACE inhibition was associated with less exposure to fresh frozen plasma compared to placebo. Study group differences in other predictors of coagulopathy, hemorrhage, and transfusion, such as surgical hemostasis, platelet dysfunction, or hemodilution may explain this finding.ACE inhibition was not associated with any safety concerns but was associated with a decreased length of hospital stay, suggesting additional benefits of perioperative ACE inhibition. Prior retrospective studies either demonstrated no difference(<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>) or an increase(<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>) in adverse clinical outcomes associated with preoperative ACE inhibition.

We cannot exclude the possibility that our results may have been different if we studied a homogenous surgery population.Nonetheless, controlling for type of surgery did not change the effect of study drug on clinical fibrinolytic and inflammatory markers.On the other hand, our diverse study population allows for generalizability of our study results to diverse cardiac surgical populations.</p><p id="P20">In conclusion, this study demonstrates that perioperative ACE inhibition increases intraoperative t-PA and bradykinin concentrations but does not increase blood loss or transfusion exposure risk, perioperative ARB does not affect plasma markers or clinical indicators of fibrinolysis, and neither ACE inhibition nor ARB alter the inflammatory response to CPB. The modest effect of ACE inhibition on the fibrinolytic balance (with no increase in detrimental effects such as blood loss or blood product transfusion) and absence of a significant effect on the inflammatory response would suggest that renin-angiotensin system inhibition plays a minor role in the postoperative fibrinolytic and inflammatory response and that ACE inhibitors and ARBsmay be safely continued until the day of surgery. Additional prospective trials are needed to assess the impact of preoperative ACE inhibition and ARB on clinical outcomes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S13"><title>Methods</title><p id="P21">Adult patients undergoing cardiac surgery with the use of CPB were eligible for study.

All patients received &#x003b5;-aminocaproic acid (antifibrinolytic drug) as a bolus of 100mg/kg over 30 minutes prior to CPB and then 25mg/kg/hour throughout surgery. Temperature management included cooling to 28&#x000b0; to 30&#x000b0;C, temperature uncorrected blood gas management (alpha stat), and cold anterograde and retrograde cardioplegia techniques when an aortic cross-clamp was applied. At the conclusion of CPB, anticoagulation was reversed with 250 mg protamine, with additional 50 mg aliquots administered to achieve baseline ACT. Vasopressors were used at separation from CPB if the mean arterial blood pressure was less than 60 mmHg. Inotropes were used for separation from CPB for the following criteria: left ventricular ejection fraction less than 40%, CPB time longer than 120 minutes, cardiac index less than 2 l/min/m<sup>2</sup>,or evidence of new onset left ventricular dysfunction by transesophageal echocardiography. Use of inotropes and/or vasopressors in the postoperative period was at the discretion of the intensive care physicians. Patients were transfused according to the following guidelines: packed red blood cells (PRBC) were transfused for a hematocrit less than 20% during CPB and for a hematocrit less than 25% after CPB. Platelets were transfused in 5-U sets for ongoing microvascular bleeding despite a normalized ACT or CPB duration &#x0003e; 120 minutes. Fresh frozen plasma (FFP) was given for an INR&#x0003e;1.5 or for continued bleeding only after platelets were given. Transfusion requirements were recorded from the beginning of surgery until hospital discharge.</p></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Assays</title><p id="P25">Blood samples were obtained to measure ACE activity,PAI-1, t-PA antigen, and inflammatory markers at five time points: 1) after induction of anesthesia and prior to surgical incision (preoperative), 2) at 60 min of CPB, 3) after separation from CPB and administration of protamine (post-bypass), 4) on postoperative day (POD)1, and 5) on POD2. All blood samples were taken from the indwelling arterial line. Not all markers were assayed at each time point. Blood for measurement of PAI-1 and t-PA was collected in vacutainer tubes containing 0.5ml 0.5 M citrate buffer (Tcoag Ireland Ltd., Ireland). All blood samples were collected on ice and centrifuged immediately at 4&#x000b0;C for 20 minutes. Plasma samples were stored at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C until the time of assay. PAI-1 antigen (TriniLIZE PAI-1 Antigen, Tcoag Ireland Ltd., Ireland) and t-PA antigen (TriniLIZE t-PA Antigen, Tcoag Ireland Ltd., Ireland)levels were determined using a 2-site enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay as previously described.(<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>) The PAI-1:t-PA molar ratio (an indicator of fibrinolytic balance) was determined using a molecular weight of 70,000 g/mol for t-PA and 50,000 g/mol for PAI-1. Blood for measurement of bradykinin was drawn into cold anhydrous ethanol (4:1 blood to ethanol). After 1 hour at 4&#x000b0;C, the mixture was centrifuged (15 minutes, 3000 rpm, 10&#x000b0;C) and the supernatant decanted and frozen at &#x02013;80&#x000b0;C until the time of assay. Bradykinin concentrations were determined using a commercially available enzyme immunoassay (Peninsula Laboratories, Inc. Division of Bachem, San Carlos, CA). A panel of human inflammatory cytokines consisting of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 were simultaneously measured using the Human Inflammation Cytokine Cytometric Bead array kit (BD Biosciences Pharmingen, San Diego, CA, USA) by the Vanderbilt University Immunology Core laboratory. Serum ACE activity was determined by a three-step colorimetric assay in which ACE hydrolyzes the substrate p-hydroxybenzoyl-glycyl-L-histidyl-L-leucine, and subsequent reactions lead to the formation of quinoneimine dye, which was measured spectrophotometrically (Fujirebio America Inc., Fairfield, NJ, U.S.A.).</p></sec><sec id="S17"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p id="P26">Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM) unless otherwise indicated. Based on preliminary data we powered the study to detect a 16 ng/ml difference in postoperative day 1 PAI-1 between either the ARB group or the ACE inhibitor group and the placebo group, assuming a standard deviation of 20 ng/ml. Twenty-six subjects per group provides 80% power with a 0.05 two-sided significance level. Discrete variables were compared among treatment groups using chi-square test or Fisher exact test depending on the number of events for three-group or pair-wise comparisons. Continuous data were compared among treatment groups using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskal-Wallis test, depending on normality of the data. Correlations were evaluated using the Spearman's rank or Pearson correlation coefficient depending on normality of the data. Longitudinal measures of PAI-1, t-PA, PAI-1:t-PA ratio, and interleukins were analyzed using mixed effects models with fixed effects of drug treatment (placebo, ramipril, candesartan) and time since randomization. We included a random subject effect and a first-order autoregressive process [AR(1)] to adjust for any errors in the mixed effects model. In separate mixed effects models, CPB time, type of surgery, use of aortic cross-clamp, and/or use of steroids in the CPB pump prime were included to adjust for their potential effects on the inflammatory response.</p><p id="P27">Predictors of post-bypass IL-6 concentrations were additionally assessed using linear regression. CPB time, type of surgery, use of aortic cross-clamp, and use of steroids in the pump prime were included in this model as independent variables. A 2-tailed P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistical analyses were performed with the statistical package IBM SPSS for Windows (Version 19.0, IBM, New York, NY) and SAS for Windows (Version 9, Cary, NC).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="S18"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Jeff Petro for his technical assistance.This research was funded by the NIH [HL085740, HL077389, and HL060609] and supported in part by Vanderbilt CTSA [Grant 1 UL1 RR024975] from the National Center for Research Resources, NIH.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="FN2"><p id="P28">Conflict of Interest/Disclosure</p><p id="P29">None of the authors has a conflict of interest or disclosure.</p><p id="P30">Frederic T.
