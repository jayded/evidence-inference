In this clinical trial we evaluated the effectiveness of GIK solutions regarding myocardial protection and early post-operative surgery outcomes in non-diabetic patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted in three months period from March 2016 to June 2016. A total number of one hundred and sixty (160) patients were randomized into two equal groups. Computer generated random numbers were used to assign patients into study and control group. Group-I (GIK group); in this group of patients glucose insulin and potassium infusion was given during surgery and Group-II (non-GIK group); in these patients only glucose infusion was given during the procedure. Initial approval for use of GIK solution in cardiac surgery patients was taken from the department of academic affairs of CPE institute of cardiology. Informed consent was taken before surgery from every patient. Patients of age more than 30 years who underwent multi-vessel coronary artery bypass grafting were selected. Diabetic patients, patients with pre-operative renal dysfunction (creatinine&#x0003e;1.2 mg/dl), valvular operations, those with previous stroke and emergency CABG were excluded.</p><p>Draw randomization was used to assign individuals to study and control groups. For study group patients, GIK solutions was prepared before induction of anesthesia by adding 70 IU of regular insulin and 70 meq of potassium in 5% dextrose of 1000 ml and the infusion was started at a rate of 30 ml/hour. In control group, only 5% dextrose infusion was given at 30 ml/hour. The infusion was started after induction of anesthesia and before the start of cardiopulmonary bypass. The infusion was started again after removal of aortic cross clamp and was continued for six hours after the operation. In non-GIK group only dextrose 5% infusion was given in the same manner as that in GIK group. In this group blood glucose levels were controlled using following protocol; RBS 80 to &#x0003c;200=no need for insulin, RBS 200 to 300= 5 units of regular insulin, RBS 300-400=7 units regular insulin, 400-500= 10 units regular insulin given subcutaneously.</p><p>Coronary artery grafting was done after establishing standard cardiopulmonary bypass. After clamping the aorta, cold blood cardioplegia was used to arrest the heart and was repeated after completion of each distal graft. Left internal mammary artery was used to vascularize left anterior descending artery in all patients.</p><p>Serum potassium and glucose levels were measured before staring the GIK infusion and after every two hours of unclamping the aorta. Standard 12 lead electrocardiogram was taken on 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> day after surgery. Post-op CKMB levels were measured after 6, 12 and 24 hours and peak levels were noted. Appearance of Q wave and ST elevation &#x0003e; 1 mm and increase in CK-MB levels more than 125 IU was recorded as perioperative myocardial infarction. Requirement of inotropic support on weaning and in immediate period after cardiopulmonary bypass was noted.</p><p>The following criteria were used to classify inotropes:</p><p>
