This randomized study evaluated the efficacy and safety of lithium or placebo as add-on to quetiapine XR in adult patients with manic or mixed symptoms of bipolar I disorder. In this 6-week, double-blind study (Trial D144AC00003), adult patients with <italic>DSM-IV-TR-</italic>diagnosed bipolar I disorder (current episode manic or mixed), a Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) total score &#x02265;20, and score &#x02265;4 on two of four core YMRS items were administered quetiapine XR (400 to 800&#x000a0;mg/day) and randomly assigned to receive add-on lithium (600 to 1,800&#x000a0;mg/day) or placebo. The primary efficacy end point was change in the YMRS total score from baseline to day 43, analyzed using a mixed-model for repeated measures (MMRM) approach. Secondary efficacy and safety end points were also measured. Rating scales were administered by trained staff. Three hundred fifty-six patients treated with quetiapine XR were randomized to add-on lithium (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;173) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 183). Two hundred ninety-one patients (81.7%) completed the study. At day 43, least squares mean change in YMRS total score was &#x02212;22.8 for add-on lithium and &#x02212;20.1 for add-on placebo, a statistically significant treatment group difference of &#x02212;2.69 (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). On secondary measures, add-on lithium was associated with significant improvements in response, remission, illness severity, and overall illness versus add-on placebo (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). The number needed to treat was 9.1 for response and 7.9 for remission for add-on lithium compared with add-on placebo. Lithium in combination with quetiapine XR was generally well tolerated, with a similar profile to quetiapine XR in combination with placebo. The addition of lithium to quetiapine XR therapy was associated with significantly greater efficacy than placebo as add-on and was generally well tolerated in patients with acute bipolar I mania.

Manic, depressed, or mixed symptoms range in severity and rate of onset and in their most extreme forms require hospitalization (Sanchez-Moreno et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2009</xref>).</p><p>Given the severe impact and rapid onset of manic symptoms in many patients, prompt and effective control of symptoms is a primary treatment goal (Garlow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2008</xref>; Oral <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2005</xref>). Guidelines typically recommend lithium, divalproex, or an atypical antipsychotic in the treatment of acute mania, frequently as monotherapy initially, with combination therapy in cases of inadequate response (Connolly and Thase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2011</xref>; Goodwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>; Grunze et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Nivoli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>; Yatham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">2009</xref>). Guidelines also recommend combination therapy as first-line treatment for severe manic symptoms (Goodwin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2009</xref>; Grunze et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2009</xref>; Nivoli et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2011</xref>). However, there is a lack of evidence to support the efficacy and safety of many combination therapies, and not all agents demonstrating antimanic efficacy as monotherapy offer additional efficacy and acceptable tolerability when used in combination (Brooks et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2011</xref>; Geoffroy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Sachs and Gardner-Schuster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2007</xref>; Smith et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2007</xref>).</p><p>Quetiapine extended release (quetiapine XR) demonstrates efficacy as monotherapy in acute mania (Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>) and bipolar depression (Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>). Yatham et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>) previously reported that quetiapine immediate release (IR) added to lithium or divalproex provided superior efficacy in treating mania when compared with lithium or divalproex alone. The potential benefits of adding lithium to quetiapine XR have not previously been investigated. The current study compared the efficacy and safety of lithium versus placebo as add-on to quetiapine XR in adults with bipolar I disorder with a current or recent episode of severe manic or mixed symptoms.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design</title><p>This was a 6-week, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, parallel-group placebo-controlled study (Trial D144AC00003; Clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT00931723), conducted at 38 study centers in eight countries (Belgium, Bulgaria, Germany, India, Poland, Russia, South Africa, and Ukraine) between June 24, 2009 and November 22, 2010. The study included an enrollment period (with medication washout for 7 to 28 days, according to medication) and a 6-week treatment period, when quetiapine XR was administered as flexible dose to all patients.

Consistent with this primary efficacy measure, the secondary efficacy measures showed that add-on lithium significantly improved a range of manic symptoms and the overall severity of illness compared with add-on placebo.</p><p>The combination of quetiapine XR with lithium was generally well tolerated, and reported AEs were consistent with the known safety profiles of these medications in bipolar disorder (Bowden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2000</xref>; Cutler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2011</xref>; Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">2010</xref>). In agreement with studies of quetiapine IR (Emsley et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2005</xref>), worsening of glycemic control was not observed during quetiapine XR treatment combined with lithium or placebo. Incidences of potentially EPS-related TEAEs were also consistent with studies of quetiapine IR combined with lithium or divalproex (Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Yatham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>). Tremor, a known side effect of lithium (Bowden <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2000</xref>), occurred at higher rates in the add-on lithium than add-on placebo group. More patients in the add-on lithium than add-on placebo group also had weight gain &#x02265;7% at the end of treatment. Add-on lithium was not associated with an altered rate of switch to depressive symptoms, which occurred at low incidences in both groups.</p><p>The current study is unique in comparing quetiapine XR combined with lithium against quetiapine XR combined with placebo. Direct comparison with previous studies - which compared a mood stabilizer combined with quetiapine IR against a mood stabilizer combined with placebo - is not possible (Sachs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Vieta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008a</xref>; Yatham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>), although all these studies indicate the superior efficacy of combination therapy versus monotherapy. In the earlier studies, quetiapine IR combined with a mood stabilizer was significantly more effective than mood stabilizer alone in acute mania (Sachs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Yatham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>) and in the prevention of recurrent mood disorder (Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Vieta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008a</xref>). A <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the two maintenance studies (Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2009</xref>; Vieta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">2008a</xref>) demonstrated that quetiapine IR combined with lithium was associated with a 68% reduction in risk of recurrence of a mood event (manic, depressive, or mixed) compared with placebo and lithium (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001), while quetiapine combined with divalproex reduced recurrence risk by 72% compared with placebo and divalproex (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) (Suppes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2013</xref>). A second <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis of the maintenance studies showed that quetiapine combined with mood stabilizer (vs. mood stabilizer alone) significantly reduced the risk of recurrence of a mood event, whether the index episode was manic, depressive, or mixed (Vieta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2012</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> &#x02264; 0.001, all). Quetiapine (IR or XR) in combination with lithium or divalproex is also associated with quality-adjusted life expectancy and cost-effectiveness benefits relative to maintenance treatment with mood stabilizers alone (Plosker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2012</xref>). Together, these findings may provide a rationale for initiating treatment with combined quetiapine XR and lithium in patients with severe acute manic symptoms, rather than escalating the dose of monotherapy up to the highest dose approved, and hence also for subsequent use of this combination as maintenance treatment to prevent recurrence.</p><p>Notable features of this study include the initiation of medications (quetiapine XR and lithium or placebo) concurrently at the start of the study, which reflects management of severe acute mania in practice. To demonstrate efficacy for combination therapy in this setting is challenging, when compared with study of patients who show partial response to monotherapy. This study also required an inpatient status at randomization, which provides reassurance on the reliability of YMRS and other scoring at baseline.</p><p>Direct comparison of the quetiapine XR and lithium combination versus other combination therapies in acute mania is hampered by the limited availability of other studies and differences in study design, duration, and patient population. Most studies report superior efficacy for combinations versus monotherapy (measured as symptom control, speed of onset, or relapse prevention), but also increased rates of AEs and related discontinuations (Geoffroy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). For example, when compared with a mood stabilizer alone, combinations including a mood stabilizer and olanzapine or asenapine are associated with weight gain, combinations including aripiprazole lead to greater risk of akathisia, and combinations including quetiapine are associated with increased somnolence (Geoffroy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>; Sachs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; Szegedi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2012</xref>; Tohen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">2002</xref>; Vieta et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">2008b</xref>; Yatham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>). While the quetiapine XR and lithium combination in the current study was associated with elevated rates of tremor and somnolence when compared with quetiapine alone, the combination was generally well tolerated and rates of treatment-related discontinuations were below add-on placebo-group levels.</p><p>This study raises a number of questions that would require further investigation. Add-on lithium showed significant benefits despite a high proportion of patients (approximately 65%) having serum lithium levels outside the target range. The target lithium range selected (0.8 to 1.2&#x000a0;mEq/L) was based on evidence for the efficacy of lithium as monotherapy in bipolar disorder (Goodwin and Jamison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">2007</xref>). <italic>Post hoc</italic> analyses in the current study reported greater efficacy (assessed as YMRS score change, response rate, and remission rate) for add-on lithium versus add-on placebo at a lithium level &#x02265;6&#x000a0;mEq/L, but not &#x0003c;6&#x000a0;mEq/L. These data are consistent with an earlier study that reported significant efficacy against manic symptoms for lithium monotherapy versus placebo at higher (0.72 and 0.5&#x000a0;mEq/kg/day) but not lower (0.24&#x000a0;mEq/kg/day) lithium doses (Stokes et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1976</xref>). It may also be conjectured that the use of lower quetiapine doses in the add-on lithium than add-on placebo group (mean modal 623.1&#x000a0;mg/day vs. 669.9&#x000a0;mg/day) contributed to reduce the between-group difference in YMRS score. Investigators may have judged that there was no requirement to increase the quetiapine dose in a substantial proportion of patients due to the effective control of manic symptoms achieved by the addition of blinded lithium. Furthermore, the lower doses of quetiapine used in the add-on lithium group may have contributed to the beneficial side effect profile of combination therapy observed in this study.</p><p>The study design excluded patients with a known lack of response to lithium or quetiapine, although only 1.7% and 7.0%, respectively, of the study population were treated with lithium and quetiapine previously. The benefits of combination therapy in lithium nonresponders are therefore unknown from this study, although other studies (Hardoy et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2005</xref>; Yatham et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>) have suggested that lithium nonresponders may benefit from combination therapy with quetiapine and lithium. The pharmacological rationale for combining quetiapine and lithium also remains to be confirmed, although it may be conjectured that the mechanisms of action of quetiapine (Nemeroff et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2002</xref>; Nord et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2011</xref>) and lithium (Quiroz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2010</xref>; Shim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2012</xref>) are complementary and additive as combination therapy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Add-on lithium enhanced the efficacy of quetiapine XR in patients with acute bipolar I mania, without compromising safety and tolerability.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec16"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="40345_2014_14_MOESM1_ESM.doc" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Tables S1 to S2.</label><caption><p>
