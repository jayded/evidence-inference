The World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) advises that the key to reducing the health burden of tobacco is to encourage abstinence among smokers<xref ref-type="fn" rid="fn0003"><sup>3</sup></xref>.</p><p>Electronic cigarettes (E-cigarettes) are battery-operated devices designed to vaporize a liquid solution of propylene glycol and vegetable glycerin in which nicotine or other aromas may be dissolved (Hon, <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Puffing activates a battery-operated heating element in the atomizer and the liquid in the cartridge is vaporized as a plume of a dense mist and inhaled. Because e-cigarettes do not burn tobacco, these products may be considered as a lower risk substitute for factory-made cigarettes (Caponnetto et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Most E-cigarettes are designed to look like traditional cigarettes and simulate the visual, sensory, and behavioral aspects of smoking traditional cigarettes (Caponnetto et al., <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>). Recent internet survey on the satisfaction of E-cigarette use has reported that the device helped in smoking abstinence and improved smoking-related symptoms (Etter, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Dawkins et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013a</xref>; Goniewicz et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Moreover, several studies has reported that the electronic cigarette helped in smoking cessation and smoking reduction (Polosa et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Caponnetto et al., <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>). These notions, indicate that the e-cigarettes may be an effective and safe cigarette substitute, and therefore merits further evaluation for this purpose. Moreover, several studies support the hypothesis that classic and electronic cigarette aids cognitive performances (McEwen et al., <xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>; Heishman et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Dawkins et al., <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2013b</xref>). Studying e-cigarettes' impact on cognitive functioning could help understanding the mechanisms underlying smoking cessation. Smoking cessation requires also a great deal of restraint over an extended period of time and it may be fruitful to consider the quitting process as a test of the smoker's ability to delay the short-term gratification from smoking a classic cigarette in favor of the long-term health benefits associated with cessation. Some researchers studied the gratification as a variable to quit smoking (Mueller et al., <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Wilson et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>).</p><p>This research aimed to explore whether different e-cigarette models can impact on craving, gesture and cognitive performances. We used three neurocognitive tests (WCST, CPT-AX, N-BACK) to compare cognitive performances in subjects who used first generation rechargeable cigalike, e-cigarettes, loaded with cartridges 24 mg nicotine, tobacco aroma, second generation, disposable cigalike electronic cigarette loaded with cartridges with 24 mg nicotine, tobacco aroma, second generation disposable cigalike electronic cigarette loaded with cartridges with 0 mg nicotine, mint aroma, second generation electronic, personal vaporizer, model Ego C (tank cartomizer), loaded with liquid nicotine 24 mg, tobacco aroma, with their usual cigarettes.</p><p>Our starting hypothesis was that the high nicotinic release of classic cigarettes compared to electronics could translate into better cognitive performance, better reduction of craving and greater gestural satisfaction.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Participants</title><p>Thirty four regular smokers were recruited, during the period May 2015&#x02013;September 2015, in Catania, Italy. No financial incentive was offered for participation. The first consecutive 34 eligible smokers were included in the study conducted at Centro per la Prevenzione e Cura del Tabagismo&#x02013;(CPCT; Universita&#x02018; di Catania, Italy). Eligible participants were invited to visit the study center, complete a questionnaire asking about demographic and smoking characteristics and undergo screening/baseline visit (medical history, blood pressure, heart rate, exhaled carbon monoxide and assessment of physical and behavioral cigarette dependence).</p><p>Inclusion criteria were: (a) smoke &#x02265;15 factory made cigarettes per day (cig/day), for at least the past 10 years, (b) age 18&#x02013;70 years, (c) in good general health; and (d) committed to follow the trial procedures.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were: (a) symptomatic cardiovascular disease; (b) symptomatic respiratory disease; (c) regular psychotropic medication use; (d) current or past history of alcohol abuse; (e) use of smokeless tobacco or nicotine replacement therapy, and (f) pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p><p>The study was approved by the local institutional ethics committee.

The Fagerstr&#x000f6;m Test for Cigarette Dependence is a standard instrument for assessing the intensity of physical addiction to nicotine. The test was designed to provide an ordinal measure of nicotine dependence related to cigarette smoking. It contains six items that evaluate the quantity of cigarette consumption, the compulsion to use, and dependence (Fagerstrom and Schneider, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>). The Glover-Nilsson Smoking Behavior Questionnaire (GN-SBQ) is a self-report measure of behavioral dependence based on behaviors that may surround smoking or thoughts about smoking (Glover et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2005</xref>). Additionally, levels of carbon monoxide in exhaled breath (eCO) were measured using a portable device (Micro CO, Micro Medical Ltd, UK).</p><p>&#x0201c;Cigarette craving&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;smoking gesture&#x0201d; were measured by asking, &#x0201c;Right now, how much do you want a cigarette?&#x0201d; &#x0201c;Right now, how much do you want a cigarette in your hand or in your mouth?&#x0201d; We asked participants to indicate their perception of all items by circling a visual analog scale number between 0 and 10, where 0 = &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; and 10 = &#x0201c;extremely.&#x0201d;</p></sec><sec><title>Procedures</title><p>At each study visit participants were requested to abstain from smoking and alcohol from 20:00 on the night before each study day and from food and caffeine for at least 1 h before the session. On arrival at the study center, carbon monoxide (CO) was measured in participants' expired breath using a portable device (Micro CO, Micro Medical Ltd, UK). If CO was &#x02264;10 parts per million (ppm), the assigned study treatment was allocated; however, if CO was &#x0003e;10 ppm or they reported smoking in the previous 12 h, participants were rescheduled wherever possible to a subsequent session. On the first study day, participants were randomized to use one of five different products: first generation rechargeable cigalike, e-cigarettes, loaded with cartridges 24 mg nicotine, tobacco aroma; second generation, disposable cigalike electronic cigarette loaded with cartridges with 24 mg nicotine, tobacco aroma; second generation disposable cigalike electronic cigarette loaded with cartridges with 0 mg nicotine, mint aroma; second generation electronic, personal vaporizer, model Ego C (tank cartomizer), loaded with liquid nicotine 24 mg, tobacco aroma; with their usual classic cigarettes.</p><p>Allocation was performed using a random sequence of five codes, each corresponding to one product, prepared in advance by the study statistician using the Latin-square method to control for time effects.</p><p>Time 1 (T1) participants sat at desks in a room where they completed ratings of craving, gesture 3 min before using their allocated product.

After the first hour, they will leave the study center and will use the study product as required for a further at least 10 h.</p><p>Ratings were made at 3 (T2), 5 (T3), 7 (T4), 17 (T5), and 32 (T6) min counting from the first 15 puff on each product.</p></sec><sec><title>Cognitive assessment</title><p>The following neuro-cognitive tests were completed, 5 min counting from the first 15 puff on each product, at the each visits: Continuous Performance Test&#x02014;AX version (CPT-AX) (Rosvold et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>), Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST) (Psychological Assessment Resources, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>), Working memory test (N-BACK) (Kirchner, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>).</p><p>CPT-AX is the most popular clinical measures of sustained attention and vigilance. The basic paradigm for CPTs involves selective attention or vigilance in response to an infrequently occurring stimulus. It is characterized by rapid presentation of continuously changing stimuli with a designated &#x0201c;X&#x0201d; stimulus (Rosvold et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">1956</xref>). The Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST), originally developed to assess abstract reasoning ability and the ability to shift cognitive strategies in response to changing environ-mental contingencies, is also considered a measure of the executive functions. WCST requires strategic planning, organized searching, utilizing environmental feedback to shift cognitive sets, directing behavior toward achieving a goal and modulating impulsive responding (Psychological Assessment Resources, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). The N-Back Test was developed as a way to measure working memory. In this test, the subject is given a sequence of stimuli, shown in order (Kirchner, <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">1958</xref>).</p><p>Following study completion, participants were invited to attend a smoking cessation treatment at Centro per la Prevenzione e Cura del Tabagismo (CPCT), AOU &#x0201c;Policlinico Vittorio Emanuele&#x0201d; University of Catania.

different electronic cigarettes. In literature, there are discordant results about the nicotine effect on cognitive performance. In detail, only one study has investigated the electronic-cigarette effect on cognition. Dawkins et al. (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) enrolled 85 smoking patients, that have been randomly divided into three groups, each under one of the following conditions: (i) 18 mg nicotine e-cigarette (nicotine), (ii) 0 mg e-cigarette (placebo) (iii) just hold the e-cigarette conditions. It has been noticed that in the subjects belonging to the first group there is been a reduction of the smoking desire and an improvement in the males' mood. Whereas, in women the same result has been obtained with the e-cigarette and the placebo conditions. Moreover, to explore the e-cigarette impact on cognitive performance, neuropsychological assessment has then been conducted. Results have shown that in the nicotine group, the working memory performance has improved and some differences have emerged with respect to placebo and to just hold groups at a longer interference periods. Our study, partially, is in line with Dawkins results: all cognitive measures attention, executive function and working memory are not influenced by the different e-cigarette and gender showing that in general electronics cigarettes could become a strong support also from a cognitive point of view for those who decide to quit smoking. Differently from Dawkins' study, the interesting result of our research is that there is no difference among electronic cigarettes with or without nicotine; this demonstrates that the daily cognitive performance is not only linked to the presence or to the absence of nicotine. Current smokers who will switch to the electronic cigarette, with or without nicotine, should not fear a reduction in cognitive performance.</p><p>For all models of electronic cigarettes breath CO levels did not rise after either series of puffs, thereby confirming that the heating of the solution did not result in combustion. The fact that electronic cigarettes generate heat to aerosolize nicotine, eliminates many of the toxic constituents (e.g., tar and carbon monoxide) created by the combustion of tobacco in classic cigarettes.</p><p>We observed a significantly increase of participants' Craving measure in group &#x0201c;C,&#x0201d; &#x0201c;H&#x0201d; &#x0201c;E&#x0201d; and in N and O group condition, we don't have a Craving effect differences. It's likely that after a night of abstinence the re-circulation of significant levels of nicotine dependence reactivate the circuit for which the craving increases progressively in relation to levels of nicotinic placed back in circulation. In fact this phenomenon occurs only for the classic cigarette and for second generation electronic cigarettes. Users of some of the early-generation ENDS products achieved nicotine levels similar to those reached with placebo (Bullen et al., <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). In contrast, users of the second-generation ENDS products with higher-voltage batteries achieved nicotine levels similar to those reached by smoking classic cigarette (Vansickel and Eissenberg, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>).</p><p>Probably the activation and persistence of craving appears dose depending because with the classic cigarette, craving increases significantly for more time compared whit the two type e-cigarettes. Specifically In C group, craving measure increase over the course of the experiment from T1 to T6 time ratings; also, in H group, craving measure increase over the course of the experiment from T1 to T6 time ratings. In E group, craving measure increase over the course of the experiment form T1 to T3 time ratings (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">3</xref>).</p><p>Overall, all the products were similar on a range of subjective ratings of user of &#x0201c;smoking gesture,&#x0201d; indicating that for some participants, satisfaction from e-cigarette use was good enough to compensate for their need of own brand cigarette. Indeed the replacement of the ritual of smoking gestures and cigarette handling. E-cig may provide a coping mechanism for conditioned smoking cues by replacing some of the rituals associated with smoking gestures. For example, smoking gestures (e.g., the tactile sensations of the cigarette and other sensations associated with smoking gestures) can play an important part in tobacco addiction as they are usually performed in a predictable, ritualistic manner that act to signal a mental context shift. When the smoker stops smoking the need for the ritual still exists and this is an important cause of relapse. Smoking cessation drugs cannot replace the rituals associated with the act of smoking. Ecig for smoking cessation or smoking reduction is intended to help smokers in coping with this important aspect of their life by implementing personalized replacement rituals.</p><p>The strengths of this study include the study addicted of dependent but healthy male and female smokers recruited from the community; the use of a crossover design to minimize variability, bias and confounding.</p><p>The study has a number of limitations. First, the small sample of primarily Caucasian, limits the study's generalizability. Second, low baseline ratings of desire to smoke may have limited the degree of observable change. Limitations of the present research include the fact that the exclusion criterion may have imposed restrictions on the sociodemographic variability within our sample; specifically, only individuals smoke &#x02265;15 factory made cigarettes were included in this study. Secondly, a growing prevalence of individuals who smoke are characterized as light&#x02014;or light and intermittent&#x02014;smokers it is unknown whether the findings of the current study could be extended to individuals who meet this criteria.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This is the first study to explore the impact of different e-cigarette models on cognitive performance (executive functions, sustained attention and vigilance, working memory). Our results suggest that neuropsychological function are not affected by group condition. The group without nicotine, that is using the &#x0201c;one mint&#x0201d; cigarette, shows the same score of the other four groups in the test used for to evaluate attention, executive functions and working memory. Therefore, the nicotine presence does not interfere with the cognitive functioning that is evaluated in its different components. Hence smokers who will switch to the electronic cigarette, with or without nicotine, should not fear a reduction in cognitive performance. It is interesting to note that the group without nicotine is different from the others due to the nicotine aroma, since the menthol cigarettes have been recently analyzed by the Food and Drug administration in USA (FDA). This variant of e-cigarette has been considered responsible to favor the dependence to smoking exactly when the mint aroma would make the breathed smoke less bitter, with a less dangerous effect for the smoker. More recent findings have demonstrated menthol role in the metabolism of nicotine in the body through the nicotinic acetylcholine (nACh) receptor in cells. This receptor is essential to the actions of nicotine in the brain showing an important role in nicotine addiction (Kabbani, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). It seems that not only craving and other smoke withdrawal symptoms but also cognitive performance is not only linked to the presence of nicotine; this suggests that the reasons behind the dependence and the related difficulty to quit smoking needs to be looked into also other factors like smokers identity, smoking rituals and the gesture.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>The study was approved by University of Catania Institutional Ethics Committee.</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Author contributions</title><p>All authors listed, have made substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and approved it for publication.</p><sec><title>Conflict of interest statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>Authors wish to thank Happy Liquid for supporting this research.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn0001"><p><sup>1</sup>World Health Organization (WHO) report on the global tobacco epidemic, 2008 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/2008/en/index.html">www.who.int/tobacco/mpower/2008/en/index.html</ext-link>.</p></fn><fn id="fn0002"><p><sup>2</sup>The health benefits of smoking cessation In.
