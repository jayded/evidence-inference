In addition, these premedicants significantly modulate not only the intraoperative requirements of the anesthetic agents, but also the postoperative outcome. We aim to compare the efficacy of both the agents in view of premedication, induction characteristics, hemodynamic changes and postoperative complications utilizing bispectral index (BIS) using propofol anesthesia.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Materials and Methods:</title><p>The type of this study was randomized control trial conducted on patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Study included 105 patients of either sex aged 20-60 years. The patients were randomly allocated into three groups: Intravenous midazolam (Group 1), clonidine (Group 2), and normal saline (Group 3) (control). The initial value of BIS and Ramsay Sedation Score, dose of propofol required for induction were noted in each group and monitored for pulse rate, electrocardiograph, noninvasive blood pressure, and BIS.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The requirement of propofol ranged from 40 to 150 mg. Mean requirement was maximum in Group 3 (109.43 &#x000b1; 20.14 mg) and it was minimum in Group 1 (78.57 &#x000b1; 22.15 mg). A significant reduction in consumption of propofol with the use of midazolam (P &#x0003c; 0.001) and clonidine (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) was observed. Both premedicants partially attenuates laryngoscoy and intubation response along with reduction in the incidence of postoperative complications.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Both clonidine and midazolam contributed equally in lowering propofol consumption. Reduction in the induction dosage of propofol and hemodynamic variations were also observed to be similar with the use of midazolam or clonidine as premedicants. Both provide a beneficial effect in relation to recovery and less postoperative complications. However clonidine premedication was found to be more effective in preventing post operative shivering and can be recommended in routine practice.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Bispectral index</kwd><kwd>clonidine</kwd><kwd>dosage</kwd><kwd>midazolam</kwd><kwd>premedication</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Surgery and anesthesia is a stressful condition and are associated with stimulation of neuroendocrinal pathway, producing various hemodynamic effects, which may be harmful to patient.

The RCT included 105 patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists Grades III and IV, using central nervous system (CNS) depressants, patients having any other chronic medical or surgical illness, cardiac illness, pregnant females, and the patients with anticipated difficult airway were excluded from the trial.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>Calculation of sample size was done on the basis of findings from a previous study[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] considering reduction in propofol dose as a main parameter.

To make study more appropriate 35 samples were considered.</p><p>After obtained informed consent, the patients were premedicated with tablet diazepam 10 mg and tablet pantaprozole 40 mg night before surgery. Intravenous (i.v.) access was established in nondominant hand in the ward and in the waiting area of the operating room. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups of 35 patients each by computer generated randomization number. The group received following medicines:</p><p>

</p><p>All the patients were monitored for respiratory depression utilizing pulse oximetry (SpO2 &#x0003c;92%), respiratory rate &#x0003c;10/min, sedation using Ramsay Sedation Score, (R) and BP.</p><p>The patients were monitored for noninvasive BP, electrocardiograph, pulse rate (Philips Sure Signs VM8) and BIS using BIS sensor and A-2000 BIS monitor XP platform (Aspect Medical Systems, Cambridge, MA, USA) standard anesthesia induction was done utilizing injection fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg followed by infusion of propofol (Fresofol 1%, Fresenius Kabi, Fresenius Kabi India Pvt.Ltd.Fifth Floor, A-wing, Ashoka Plaza, Pune-Nagar Road, Survey No. 32/2,Vadgaon Sheri, Viman Nagar, Pune- 411014, Maharashtra, India) at 30 mg/kg/h until BIS stabilized at 48 &#x000b1; 2 and remained stable for that. Once the desired BIS value was reached, propofol infusion was switched off and total dose of propofol was noted. The patients were mechanically ventilated with 66% N2O in O2 (Dr&#x000e4;ger-PrimusGermany) and sevoflurane &#x02264;1.5% for 3 min.after giving injection vecuronium. The value of BIS and hemodynamic parameters were noted at the time of loss of consciousness, at the time of intubation and thereafter every minute for first 10 min after intubation. The observer was blinded to the premedicant being given to the patient. Anesthesia was maintained with 66% nitrous oxide in oxygen, sevoflurane dial concentration of &#x02264;1.5%, intermittent vecuronium and fentanyl. No dose of fentanyl was administered once the gall bladder was dissected out from the liver bed. No antiemetic was administered to any group of patient. Sevoflurane was switched off on commencing of closure of skin incision. The patients were administered aqueous solution of injection diclofenac 75 mg i.v. before extubation. Neuromuscular blockade was reversed with injection neostigmine (0.05 mg/kg) mixed with injection glycopyrolate (0.02 mg/kg). A gentle oral suctioning was done and patient extubated. No neuromuscular monitoring was used in our study. The patients were shifted to postanesthesia care unit. The patients were also assessed for postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting, and shivering. The primary outcome of this study was to compare the propofol dose consumption for anesthesia induction with i.v. clonidine and midazolam premedication, whereas the secondary outcome was to evaluate the preoperative sedation status BP, heart rate (HR) changes during laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV), postoperative shivering, and postoperative pain between the groups.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS version 21.

Midazolam attenuates cardiovascular response to laryngoscopy and intubation nearly as well as clonidine except for HR. Premedicaton with clonidine is better than midazolam in preventing postoperative shivering. We found 28.20% decrease with the use of 0.05 mg/kg i.v. midazolam and 26.70% reduction with the use of 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v. clonidine in propofol dose. This decrease in the dose of propofol with the use of midazolam or clonidine has also been shown by other authors, though the decreased was variable. This variation may be attributed to the higher doses of oral clonidine being used for preoperative sedation 4-5 &#x003bc;g/kg in the previous studies,[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] while we used only 1.5 &#x003bc;g/kg i.v.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref><xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] observed mean reduction in the propofol doses after midazolam pretreatment, more than our study, the reason, which may be attributed to this difference is relatively younger age group of the patients in our study. This study supports that induction doses of propofol required were less with midazolam premedication as compared to clonidine clinically, which could be due to the fact that both propofol and midazolam have been known to have a depressive effect on the CNS via GABA-A receptor-mediated inhibition, and share a common receptor or exert effect on the GABA-A receptor.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>The BIS monitor is a well-established monitor for measuring depth of anesthesia.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>Target-controlled infusion provides a precise blood concentration of propofol, but due to its unavailability in our setup at the time of study, we used the infusion of propofol at the rate of 30 mk/kg/h in lieu of the study of Mi[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and study conducted in our department by Arya S <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p><p>Clonidine is more effective in blunting the reflex tachycardia associated with laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, reduced intra-operative labiality of BP, HR as well as decrease in dosage of narcotics and their supplementations.

A study has shown bradycardia and bradypnea only with 5 &#x003bc;g/kg that is higher than the dose used in our study. The activation of presynaptic alpha-2 adrenoreceptors in peripheral nervous terminations inhibits norepinephrine exocytosis partially explaining the hypotensive and bradycardia-inducing effects of such receptor agonists.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Bispectral index value increases significantly after tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Such response can be reduced by premedication with midazolam or clonidine, which is in agreement with the findings of Paris <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>We observed no association between preinduction BIS value and Ramsay Sedation Score.

The exact cause is not known; however, Paris <italic>et al</italic>., in their study also noticed similar observations, they correlated this to the use of preoperative diazepam, which has got longer half-life received a night before surgery as regular premedication as per their hospital policy.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] We also gave tablet diazepam 10 mg at night before surgery to all our patients.</p><p>In this study, the incidence of shivering was least with use of clonidine as premedicant. This has been attributed to the well-known antishivering effects of clonidine at three levels: Hypothalamus, locus coeruleus and spinal cord.
