Home-based training with telemonitoring guidance could improve participation rates and enhance long-term effectiveness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and results</title><p>We randomised 90 low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation to three months of either home-based training with telemonitoring guidance or centre-based training. Although training adherence was similar between groups, satisfaction was higher in the home-based group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.02). Physical fitness improved at discharge (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) and at one-year follow-up (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.01) in both groups, without differences between groups (home-based <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.31 and centre-based <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.87).

However, home-based training was associated with a higher patient satisfaction and appears to be more cost-effective than centre-based training. We conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance can be used as an alternative to centre-based training for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering cardiac rehabilitation.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Cardiac rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>home-based training</kwd><kwd>telemonitoring</kwd><kwd>physical fitness</kwd><kwd>physical activity</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-2047487317710803"><title>Introduction</title><p>Although cardiovascular disease remains a major cause of mortality and results in approximately 17 million annual deaths worldwide, the number of deaths decreases each year.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> This is caused, among others, by high quality cardiac rehabilitation after an initial cardiac event.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="bibr3-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a multidisciplinary treatment aiming at physical and psychosocial recovery after an acute coronary syndrome or cardiac intervention and prevention of future events.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Exercise-based CR has been shown to reduce mortality, prevent hospital readmission and improve quality of life.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="bibr5-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="bibr6-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Nonetheless, two persistent barriers limit the effectiveness of CR. First, participation in centre-based CR is low because a substantial number of patients do not participate or drop out at a later stage. This is partly due to health system barriers such as a lack of referral to CR.<sup><xref rid="bibr7-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> But there are also important practical barriers such as travelling time to the outpatient CR clinic and limited availability due to work resumption. In addition, personal barriers such as reluctance to participate in group-based therapy and individual training preferences that deviate from what is offered in centre-based CR can limit participation rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr9-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> Second, the long-term effectiveness of CR is low.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Although it is well established that low physical activity levels (i.e. physical inactivity) are a major health risk,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> health systems struggle to incorporate physical activity enhancement in (secondary) prevention and intervention programmes. Exercise-based CR is often aimed at short-term improvement of physical fitness rather than inducing long-term lifestyle changes. In fact, patients in centre-based CR are often not sufficiently prepared for independent exercise in the home environment. Therefore, the beneficial effects of CR tend to decrease after supervised training in the outpatient clinic has completed.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr12-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr13-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>We hypothesised that if CR were tailored to the patients&#x02019; preferences and CR programmes were aimed at preparing patients for independent exercise and physical activity, then uptake could be improved, dropout rates reduced and beneficial effects of exercise-based CR sustained. Wearable sensor technologies and ubiquitous connectivity have introduced new possibilities of delivering physical fitness and physical activity interventions in the home environment at low cost.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Previous studies have demonstrated that home-based CR is a safe alternative to centre-based CR and short-term effectiveness is similar.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> However, home-based CR has the potential to improve participation in CR programmes, especially for patients who are unable to participate in the conventional centre-based CR due to work resumption or other scheduling problems.<sup><xref rid="bibr8-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> In addition, exercise training in the home environment with remote support may aid patients in developing self management skills for improving and maintaining their physical fitness levels after completion of CR, thereby enhancing long-term effectiveness of CR.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Previous studies showed beneficial effects of telerehabilitation interventions after completion of centre-based CR<sup><xref rid="bibr18-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> or in combination with centre-based CR.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> However, those interventions were an addition to usual care, and therefore require additional costs. If a telerehabilitation intervention replaces usual care, then these beneficial effects may be achieved without additional costs. Unfortunately, data on cost-effectiveness of telerehabilitation interventions are scarce.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Furthermore, when the intervention uses telemonitoring guidance to provide patients with the opportunity to develop self-management skills for maintaining an active lifestyle after CR, beneficial effects can be sustained over time.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> If the telemonitoring guidance is focused on behavioural change using coaching strategies (i.e. motivational interviewing and cognitive behaviour therapy) and objective feedback, patients will be sufficiently prepared for independent exercise in the home environment.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="bibr22-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup></p><p>To study the long-term effects and costs of home-based CR, we developed a home-based exercise training intervention with telemonitoring guidance for low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering CR.

During these sessions, patients were familiarised with training duration and intensity and their preferred training modality was discussed with a physical therapist and exercise specialist. In addition, they were instructed how to use a heart rate monitor with a chest strap (Garmin FR70) and how to upload recorded heart rate data to a web application (Garmin Connect) through the Internet. After the three training sessions, patients started their training programme in the home environment. The heart rate monitor was used to record the exercise data and to evaluate training duration and intensity during the training. The web application was used by the patient, the physical therapist and the exercise specialist to review the data. Once a week the patient received feedback on training frequency, duration and intensity via telephone by the physical therapist. Motivational interviewing principles were used to enhance patients&#x02019; motivation and encourage the development of self-management skills.

During the assessment a 12-lead electrocardiogram was monitored continuously. PeakVO<sub>2</sub> was defined as the average oxygen uptake during the final 30&#x02009;s of the individualised ramp protocol. Ventilatory anaerobic threshold (VAT) was assessed using the V-slope method<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> by two independent physicians who were blinded for patient allocation. When the VAT of an exercise test deviated over 10% between the two physicians, a third physician was asked for an additional assessment of the VAT. An average of the two nearest values was selected.</p><p>Physical activity was determined as physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and physical activity level (PAL), estimated from data of a tri-axial accelerometer worn at the hip (ActiGraph wGT3X+ monitor) and heart rate monitor with chest strap (Garmin FR70) with a chest strap. Patients were instructed to wear both sensors continuously during daytime for a period of five subsequent days. Accelerometry (ACC) data was recorded with a sample frequency of 40 Hz and was time-aligned with the heart rate monitor (beats per minute). For analysis, ACC data was resampled into 20&#x02009;Hz epochs and filtered using a band pass filter (0.5&#x02013;3&#x02009;Hz) and a median filter (window size 5) before counts per minute were calculated. In order to determine the PAL, physical activity energy expenditure was divided by resting metabolic rate, calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation.<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Physical activity energy expenditure was calculated from ACC, heart-rate data and patient characteristics using a multivariate regression model for beta-blocker medicated cardiac patients. To develop the model, the heart-rate and ACC data of 16 CR patients were measured during a resting metabolic rate assessment and activity protocol. Simultaneously, energy expenditure was measured using breath-by-breath pulmonary gas exchange measurement (Cosmed K4, b2 portable system). Results of the model development and validation are published elsewhere.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">29</xref></sup> A physical activity assessment was considered successful when at least one day with at least eight hours of useful ACC and heart-rate data was recorded. When the physical activity assessment was considered successful, we used all useful heart-rate and ACC data available for the calculation of PAEE. We calculated PAL to allow comparing physical activity measurements for subjects with different body size and composition. PAL is an accepted parameter to express a person&#x02019;s daily energy expenditure. When PAL is used to classify the intensity of an activity, PAL&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;3, PAL&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;6, and PAL&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;6 are characterised as light, moderate, and vigorous intensity activities, respectively.<sup><xref rid="bibr30-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> An average daily PAL of 1.2 represents the activity level of a bed-bound subject, while the average PAL for the adult population is 1.7.<sup><xref rid="bibr31-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup></p><p>Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was assessed using the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36) and the MacNew questionnaire.<sup><xref rid="bibr32-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="bibr33-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">33</xref></sup> Results of the SF-36 questionnaire were used to calculate the health utility scores for the cost-utility analyses.

The MacNew score ranges from 1&#x02013;7, where a high score indicates better quality of life. Patient satisfaction was measured directly after completion of CR (either home-based or centre-based) using the Consumer Quality index. The Consumer Quality index is a standardised patient survey method developed by the Dutch Center for Consumer Experience in Health Care, combining the inventory of patient experiences with an assessment of their priority.<sup><xref rid="bibr34-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></sup> Psychological status was assessed using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and patient health questionnaire (PHQ).<sup><xref rid="bibr35-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup></p><p>Outcome measures were assessed at baseline, after CR and one year after the start of CR.

Patients in the home-based group recorded their training sessions in the web application using the heart rate monitor. These data were used to determine training adherence, training frequency, training intensity and time spent in the prescribed training zone. Other healthcare resource use, medication use and productivity losses from paid and unpaid work were recorded by means of a cost questionnaire at three, six and 12 months after inclusion. When the questionnaire was completed, but answers concerning hospital resource use or medication use were missing or unclear, validation was performed via the electronic patient record.</p></sec><sec id="sec7-2047487317710803"><title>Cost analysis</title><p>Healthcare costs were obtained by multiplying health care resource use by the unit costs obtained from the Dutch manual for costing in economic evaluations<sup><xref rid="bibr36-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> and converted to 2015 price levels with the general Dutch consumer price index.<sup><xref rid="bibr37-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Estimated costs of the CR intervention were based on adherence data.

This was multiplied by the hourly cost of a physical therapist (&#x020ac;66.08, which includes overhead). For the home-based group, costs for the supervised sessions were calculated similarly. Additional costs were incurred for the heart rate monitor (&#x020ac;75) and the additional time spent to introduce home-based training (30&#x02009;min, &#x020ac;33), the preparation and conduction of the ten weekly telephone calls (5&#x02009;min preparation and 9&#x02009;min calling, &#x020ac;55 and &#x020ac;99 respectively).

The QALYs were estimated based on the health utility scores at 0, 3, 6 and 12 months, by applying the area-under-the-curve method. The evaluation was performed from a societal perspective, making a distinction between healthcare and non-healthcare costs (absenteeism from paid and unpaid work). In a sensitivity analysis presenteeism was also included in the societal perspective. Non-parametric bootstrapping was used, involving 1000 replications, to calculate uncertainty around the costs and effects estimates. Based on these results a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve was constructed by plotting the proportion of costs and effects pairs for which home-based CR is cost-effective compared to centre-based CR, for a range of values of the willingness to pay for a QALY (&#x003bb;).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec10-2047487317710803"><title>Results</title><p>Between March 2013&#x02013;December 2014 we included 90 CR patients (10 female/80 male, mean age 59.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;8.5 years), of which 78 completed the study.

Also, we were unable to detect a change in physical activity levels at one-year follow-up in both groups. Whereas HRQoL and psychological status were similar in both groups, patient satisfaction was higher in the home-based group. Our cost-effectiveness analysis showed that home-based training with wearable sensors is likely to be more cost-effective than centre-based training in cardiac rehabilitation patients.</p><p>Our short-term results are in line with the conclusions of the systematic review by Taylor et&#x000a0;al., who demonstrated that home-based and centre-based CR are equally effective in improving short-term physical fitness.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> Long-term effectiveness of home-based CR is less well established and seems to be related to the content of the intervention. We demonstrated that with motivational coaching strategies and objective feedback on training data, patients in the home-based group are able to maintain their physical fitness levels at one year. This is consistent with the findings of Aamot et&#x000a0;al., who employed a similar monitoring strategy during the study.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup> Interestingly, patients in our centre-based group were able to maintain their physical fitness levels as well, in contrast to prior centre-based CR studies.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>,<xref rid="bibr45-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">45</xref></sup> This may be attributed to the fact that due to the nature of our intervention, with its focus on technology and individual training, mainly young and motivated patients participated in our study. These patients, randomised to either home-based or centre-based CR, were able to maintain their physical fitness levels independently. Therefore, based on this study we cannot conclude that home-based CR leads to superior long-term physical fitness. However, our data showed that for this patient population, home-based CR is effective to improve and maintain physical fitness levels similar to those in centre-based CR. Moreover, home-based CR was associated with high patient satisfaction levels and low costs for absenteeism from work. Therefore, we postulate that implementation of home-based CR can increase uptake, especially among younger cardiac patients with the ambition to return to work as soon as possible.</p><p>Physical inactivity is associated with most chronic diseases,<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> but CR is often focused on improvement of physical fitness rather than increasing physical activity levels and preventing physical inactivity. Although we monitored physical activity levels before and after CR, the telemonitoring guidance was mainly focused on physical fitness improvement. As a result, neither the centre-based nor the home-based training influenced the physical activity levels. These results are in line with previous studies that showed that exercise interventions focused on physical fitness improvement in cardiac patients did not result in an improvement in physical activity.<sup><xref rid="bibr46-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">46</xref><xref rid="bibr47-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr48-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">48</xref></sup> Yet, other studies that combined an exercise intervention with a physical activity intervention during CR, did improve physical activity levels.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr49-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">49</xref></sup> This implies that an improvement in physical fitness is not necessarily associated with an improvement in physical activity levels. Therefore, we recommend that exercise interventions are complemented with physical activity coaching, to influence daily activity behaviour. Ideally, physical activity coaching is based on objective and accurate data to maximise effectiveness,<sup><xref rid="bibr50-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">50</xref></sup> and remains available after the completion of CR. On-demand coaching can identify a relapse into an inactive lifestyle, which is often observed after completion of CR. In this way, coaching is available when it is needed the most. Currently, physical activity in CR studies is often assessed by questionnaires or accelerometers.<sup><xref rid="bibr51-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></sup> With the development of wearable technology, a more reliable and accurate assessment of physical activity levels is available.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="bibr52-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">52</xref></sup> The methodology used in this study, combining heart rate with accelerometer data to estimate physical activity energy expenditure, can be considered as a first step towards accurate physical activity monitoring using wearable sensors in cardiac rehabilitation patients.</p><p>Although cost-effectiveness of an innovative intervention is essential for wide scale implementation, cost-effectiveness analyses on home-based CR programmes are scarce. Taylor et&#x000a0;al. described four randomised controlled trials and concluded that although the costs included in the analyses varied between studies, the costs between home-based and centre-based CR appeared to be similar.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> In two further studies Frederix et&#x000a0;al. indicated that a comprehensive telerehabilitation programme was more cost-effective than regular CR,<sup><xref rid="bibr53-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></sup> while Kidholm et&#x000a0;al. showed that a cardiac telerehabilitation programme was not more cost-effective compared to regular centre-based CR.<sup><xref rid="bibr54-2047487317710803" ref-type="bibr">54</xref></sup> However, the latter two studies provided additional telerehabilitation services after conventional CR, resulting in additional healthcare costs, which hampers the likelihood of implementation. Our results indicate that a telerehabilitation programme with equal duration to a regular CR programme could be a cost-effective alternative without increasing costs associated with the CR intervention. In our study, the average medical costs per patient were in favour of home-based CR. In addition, from a societal perspective the average costs per patient were &#x020ac;3160 higher for patients in centre-based CR. However, this difference was not significant. This difference was mainly caused by absenteeism from paid work between groups. Whereas patients in the home-based group were able to schedule their training sessions in their own time, patients in the centre-based group were obliged to visit the outpatient clinic during office hours, twice a week.</p></sec><sec id="sec17-2047487317710803"><title>Limitations</title><p>A first limitation of our study was the lack of blinding for the physician for patient allocation during the assessments of physical fitness at discharge and follow-up. Therefore, knowledge of group allocation could have affected the assessments. However, data from the maximal exercise tests (i.e. maximum heart rate and respiratory exchange ratio) showed that exhaustion was similar between groups. Second, although physical activity levels were assessed accurately by combining a heart rate monitor with an accelerometer, several patients experienced discomfort while wearing the chest-strap of the heart rate monitor for five consecutive days. Consequently, some patients terminated the physical activity assessment prematurely, resulting in a lower reliability of data. We expect that with the development of wrist-based heart-rate monitors, future studies can avoid this limitation. Third, the home-based intervention required patients to have basic PC and Internet skills to install and use the software platform. Nonetheless, some patients experienced problems with installing the software platform and uploading exercise data on the platform. This could have hindered the use of the software platform, therefore limiting the effectiveness of the telemonitoring guidance. Fourth, training intensity during supervised training sessions in the outpatient clinic was only measured at set intervals to ensure the prescribed intensity range. Therefore, no continuous heart rate data was available, and no comparison of training volume between groups was possible.</p><p>As mentioned in the discussion, the patients included in our study were not representative of the general CR population. Due to our selection process, we included mainly young and motivated patients that preferred to participate in home-based training. This can explain why the centre-based group were able to maintain their long-term physical fitness levels, even when they started with centre-based training and had to make the transition to the home environment without guidance. In addition, many patients expressed their preference for home-based training and were subsequently disappointed when randomised to the centre-based group. This was supported by the lower patient satisfaction score in the centre-based group. Furthermore, the external validity of the results are limited because patients with a strong preference for one trial arm were possibly not participating due to the risk of being randomised in the non-preferred trial-arm. If preference-based trial-arms are included in a study design, a more mixed cardiac rehabilitation population can be obtained. However, this study design has substantial consequences on the sample size and costs of the study. Similarly, a blended study design can prevent demoralisation after randomisation in the non-preferred trial-arm. In this design, patients that prefer home-based training can switch from supervised centre-based training to home-based training with telemonitoring guidance when it is considered safe by the physicians. Subsequently, effectiveness can be compared between patients that complete centre-based training and patients that switched to home-based training during CR.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec18-2047487317710803"><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study shows comparable results for home-based CR and centre-based CR with respect to improving physical fitness and health-related quality of life. Furthermore, exercise adherence of patients in the home-based CR was high and patient-satisfaction was significantly higher than patients in the centre-based group. Home-based CR has the potential to increase overall participation in exercise-based CR, especially for cardiac patients with the ambition to return to work quickly or with transportation difficulties. In addition, home-based CR appears to have lower societal costs and to be more cost-effective than centre-based CR. Therefore, we conclude that home-based training with telemonitoring guidance is a useful alternative to conventional centre-based training for young and motivated low-to-moderate cardiac risk patients entering CR.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank the patients and clinical partners of the M&#x000e1;xima Medical Center Veldhoven and Eindhoven who participated in this study.
