These changes in body composition, low muscle mass, and/or low muscle strength may coexist in the same person, a condition defined as sarcopenic O. This condition may induce a decrease in the level of physical activity, reducing the most important trophic effect on muscle mass as well as predisposing adults to positive energy balance and FM gain.

After 5 minutes of aerobic warm-up performed on a treadmill, the following isotonic exercises were performed in a circuit: knee flexion, arm raise, shoulder abduction, shoulder adduction, shoulder rotation, squat, biceps curl, triceps extensions, calves raise, push-up, abdominal crunch, and hip extension. All participants were encouraged to accomplish the exercise movement within 45 seconds. Weight resistance was performed using elastic bands and free weights; contraction time was 5 seconds for eccentric and concentric phases followed by rest for 40 seconds. In order to allow a proper familiarization with the exercises with the correct and safe technique of execution and breathing, training intensity was lower during the first three sessions. After this period, the exercise intensity (70%) was controlled based on the individual preprogrammed target heart rate previously calculated using the Karvonem equation: % of work &#x000d7; (maximal heart rate - baseline heart rate) + baseline heart rate, corrected for resting heart rate on the day of the exercise and monitored in all participants during training sessions by Polar-HR monitors (S150; S&#x000e3;o Paulo, Brazil). To minimize fatigue, the exercise was alternated between upper and lower body exercises. Rest was used between sets of 40 seconds, but there were no pauses between repetitions. Each session was guided by trained fitness instructors and supervised by the researchers.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistics</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for Windows software (version 12.0, SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA).

The contribution of ET in general for the weight loss process is due to the increase in daily caloric expenditure promoted by the fat-free mass, as found in our study. Additionally, the ET energy expenditure may also stimulate elevation of basal metabolic rate due to increased muscle mass. It is believed that the tendencies of people to gain weight with age are due largely to a reduced basal metabolic rate by progressive LM loss.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27-cia-7-551">27</xref></p><p>Not surprisingly, strength exercises can substantially modify the body composition and capacity of power generation in different populations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28-cia-7-551">28</xref> In relationship to CT, the effectiveness is unclear, with studies showing positive<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8-cia-7-551">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b29-cia-7-551">29</xref> and discordant results<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9-cia-7-551">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b30-cia-7-551">30</xref> in adults and old people. However, clinically, our results are important for future research, specifically for sarcopenic subjects. The loss of muscle mass reduces targets available to insulin-responses, promoting insulin resistance, in turn promoting metabolic syndrome and O.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31-cia-7-551">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35-cia-7-551">35</xref> Moreover, increasing FM promotes production of tumor necrosis factor-&#x003b1;, interleukin-6, and other adipokines that further promote insulin resistance as well as potentially having a direct catabolic effect on muscle reducing the muscle strength. Villareal et al<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36-cia-7-551">36</xref> suggest that sarcopenic O is a major public health problem; in this perspective, circuit-based exercise is considered cheaper and a reliable method for preventing sarcopenic status.</p><p>Additionally, it is known that one factor contributing to the failure of the treatment of O is maintaining a low-calorie diet intake for long periods, causing demotivation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37-cia-7-551">37</xref> An important feature of ET is that it allows the possibility of a large number of people taking part in exercise sessions. This fact corresponds to the wide variety of exercise as well as the increased possibility of intrapersonal relationships with exercise practice, leading to higher level of motivation during training.</p><p>There were some limitations to this study. This was a relatively small sample study, and it was not designed to examine possible biochemical mechanisms of bone adaptation to exercise programs.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrated the positive effects of circuit strength training on body composition parameters, and relevant importance should be given to improve LM in obese older women. For future therapeutic considerations, the present work may support the safety and utility of this exercise modality for larger trials, as well as for education and physical training in this population.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgment</title><p>The authors are grateful to F&#x000e1;rlley Rodrigues for assistance with language correction and layout of this article.</p></ack><fn-group><fn id="fn1-cia-7-551"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-cia-7-551"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Sorkin</surname><given-names>JD</given-names></name><name><surname>Muller</surname><given-names>DC</given-names></name><name><surname>Andres</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Longitudinal change in height of men and women: implications for interpretation of the body mass index: the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging</article-title><source>Am J Epidemiol</source><year>1999</year><volume>150</volume><issue>9</issue><fpage>969</fpage><lpage>977</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10547143</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-cia-7-551"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Arterburn</surname><given-names>DE</given-names></name><name><surname>Crane</surname><given-names>PK</given-names></name><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>SD</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The coming epidemic of obesity in elderly Americans</article-title><source>J Am Geriatr Soc</source><year>2004</year><volume>52</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>1907</fpage><lpage>1912</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15507070</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-cia-7-551"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Villareal</surname><given-names>DT</given-names></name><name><surname>Apovian</surname><given-names>CM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kushner</surname><given-names>RF</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Obesity in older adults: technical review and position tatement of the American Society for Nutrition and NAASO, The Obesity Society</article-title><source>Am J Clin Nutr</source><year>2005</year><volume>82</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>923</fpage><lpage>934</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">16280421</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-cia-7-551"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Kaplan</surname><given-names>NM</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The deadly quartet.
