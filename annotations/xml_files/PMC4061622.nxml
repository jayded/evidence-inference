One of the most stressful treatment interventions imposing high level of anxiety to the families of patients is when the patients are undergoing a surgery, especially a cardiac surgery.

Families of patients undergoing open heart surgery were randomly divided into two groups of study and control.

It has been reported that stress and anxiety stimulate adrenal gland and sympathetic nervous system which, in a sophisticated process, leads to an increase in BP, respiratory irregularities, dyspnea, an increase in the rate of respiration and hearth rate, and in case of frequent prolonged exposure to chronic stress and anxiety, it results in hypertension and other diseases.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>Restlessness, sorrow and sadness, loss of appetite, hypertension, an increase in respiratory irregularities, palpitation, and disturbance in concentration and doing daily activities are among the signs and symptoms of these depressive and stress-causing factors.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Anexity is one of the most repeated nursing diagnosis in the world.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] Studies investigating anxiety, stress, and depression in patients&#x02019; families have been conducted, and it has been revealed that a disease creates a stressful situation for both the patients and their families.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Research showed that hospitalization of a family member imposes high stress on other members and leads to depression,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] especially when their patient is to undergo invasive interventions.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] On the other hand, family, as the first social unit in Iranian society, has a specific role and acts as a base for physical, cultural, and social health.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Therefore, supporting the families whose patients undergo treatment is one of the main duties of nurses.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This can be given by nurses to families as psychological, mental, and social support.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] As the families have a key role in maintenance of patients&#x02019; health after discharge, relieving their anxiety is helpful and of great importance.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] One of the factors which play a major role in the reduction of anxiety, depression, and stress is individuals&#x02019; religious beliefs. Muslims always remember God when exposed to anxiety and stress and seek help from Him.</p><p>Remembering God can be in the form of litany and prayer. One type of litany is Recommended Azkar, as Muslims believe Zekr can relax, clear heart, treat pain, meditate the soul, and light wisdom.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] It has been shown in Muslim countries that prayer can decrease pain in addition to reducing anxiety, stress, and depression. Azma <italic>et al</italic>. showed that praying results in reduction of disease signs.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Rosmarin (2009) showed that strong belief in God can also reduce stress and anxiety and increase happiness in non-Muslims.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] International studies reported that individuals, to seek help, refer to clergymen (42%), a general physician (29%), a psychologist or a psychiatrist (18%), and social workers&#x02019; institutes (11%).[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] In some countries, there is a nurse at the operating room who tries to help families reduce their anxiety, stress, and depression through various methods.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Meanwhile, where there are no such supporting systems, nurses should not forget the patients&#x02019; families and should try to find methods to reduce patients&#x02019; families&#x02019; anxiety, stress, and depression. With regard to high prevalence of anxiety, stress, and depression in families of patients before surgery and with respect to the importance of making peace for families, and the treatment property of Recommended Azkar as well as the socio-cultural conditions of Iranian society, the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of religious Recommended Azkar on anxiety, stress, and depression of the families of the patients undergoing an open heart surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ATERIALS AND</sc> M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>This is a pre-experimental study conducted on 120 family members of the patients undergoing open heart surgery in Shafa Medical Center in Kerman, Iran in the first half of 2011. The researcher referred to the surgical waiting room on different days when the families of the patients undergoing open heart surgery existed. After giving them information about the study and obtaining a written consent from them, they were assigned to two groups of study and control through random allocation. It was such that all eligible individuals who fulfilled the inclusion criteria had equal chance to enter any of the groups (study or control). The inclusion criteria were no history of mental diseases, no history of intake of psychotropic medication including anti-depressants and anti-anxiety medication, no drug abuse, being a Muslim, being an immediate family member of the patient (father, mother, spouse, sister, or brother), being literate at least to the extent of reading and writing Persian to fill the questionnaire, and being over 20 years of age (in order to be mature enough to understand the meanings of Recommended Azkar). The exclusion criteria was having open heart surgery for more than one time. To conduct the intervention, the researcher randomly selected a patient referring for open heart surgery to the cardiac surgery ward through lotto and assigned his/her accompanying person to the study group if he/she was an immediate family member of the patient. On another day, another patient was randomly selected (through lotto) and his/her accompanying person was assigned to the control group if he/she was an immediate family member of the patient.</p><p>The Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS 21) questionnaire was filled by both groups before intervention. Then, the study group underwent training about the use of Azkar including Hamd-Va-Soureh for seven times and La-ilaha-illallah for 100 times for 20 min at the session of selection.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] The importance of Recommended Azkar such as La-ilaha-illallah and Hamd-Va-Soureh has been emphasized in various textbooks of Muslims.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Generally, Muslims believe in two types of Recommended Azkar: 1) verbal Recommended Azkar, which is naming God and saying Tasbih, Tahmid, Takbir, and Tahlil (La-ilaha-illallah) and 2) internal Recommended Azkar, which is remembering God from the bottom of heart. Among the Recommended Azkar causing relaxation and reducing anxiety and restlessness, Hamd-Va-Soureh and La-ilaha-illallah (no power and force is greater than of God's) have been recommended more.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] So, the researcher used those Recommended Azkar, and 1 h after intervention, the questionnaire was filled again. In the control group, no training on Recommended Azkar was given and just the routine interventions were administered, and the questionnaire was filled after 1 hour. As an open heart surgery lasts for an average of 3 h and the highest level of anxiety, stress, and depression of patients&#x02019; families is observed in these 3 h, the researcher devoted the first hour in explaining to patients&#x02019; families, obtaining a signed consent form, and in initial filling up of the questionnaire. The second hour was devoted to educating them on Recommended Azkar and making them say that, and the third hour was devoted to refilling the questionnaires. At the end of research, if any subject in the control group had accidentally used Recommended Azkar, he/she was left out of the study. Before completing the questionnaire, an informed written consent was obtained from the subjects and the questionnaires were anonymous. The subjects were assured that their acceptance or rejection to participate in the study had no effect on their patients&#x02019; treatment.</p><p>DASS 21 questionnaire includes 21 questions through which signs of anxiety, stress, and depression are separately measured by seven questions, respectively. Each question is scored in a 4-point Likert's scale (none&#x02013;many) ranging from 0 to 3, and the scores are summed up at the end. In this scale, the scores ranged 0-21. Scores 0-4 show normal level of depression, 0-3 show normal level of anxity and 0-7 show normal level of sress, 5-7 show low level of depression, 4-5 show low level of anxity and 8-9 show low level of sress, 8-11 show moderate level of depression, 5-7 show moderate level of anxity and 10-13 show moderate level of sress, 12-15 show severe level of depression, 8-9 show severe level of anxity and 14-17 show severe level of sress, 25 + show extremely severe level of depression, 10 + show extremely severe level of anxity and 18 + show extremely severe of sress,. This questionnaire was suggested firstly by Loviband (1995) and tested in a larger sample of humans. It was adopted on numerous subjects in England and its reliability and validity were confirmed.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] Gylensten <italic>et al</italic>., in a study titled &#x0201c;Investigation of the association between stress and work,&#x0201d; used DASS 21 questionnaire.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] Aghebati, in a study on the effect of touch therapy on the level of pain and mental signs of depression, anxiety, and stress in cancer patients, used this questionnaire and reported its reliability[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] as 0.9 in Iran. The present study had limitations and the researchers tried to modify them. One of the limitations was the contact between subjects and the families of the patients who had already undergone surgery, which could have an effect on the obtained results. So, the researchers tried to separate subjects from other patients&#x02019; families. Descriptive and inferential statistical tests (Chi-square, independent <italic>t</italic>-test, and paired <italic>t</italic>-test) were used to analyze the data in SPSS. <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered significant.

So, this method can be used to reduce tension and to prevent anxiety, stress, and depression.</p><p>In the past two decades, numerous studies have been conducted on reduction of anxiety, but few studies have been carried out to reduce patients&#x02019; accompanying persons&#x02019; anxiety. The present study showed that patients&#x02019; open heart surgery imposes anxiety, stress, and depression to their accompanying persons.</p><p>In this regard, Syahkali <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on the factors related to anxiety of accompanying persons of the patients hospitalized in ICU, showed that 77% of patients&#x02019; families had anxiety and the families that encouraged the patients to surgery faced sixfold more of anxiety.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Pochard <italic>et al</italic>. showed that observing a beloved person in a critical condition is stressful.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Present study showed that Askar can reduce anxiety, stress, and depression of patients&#x02019; accompanying persons. Nikbakht Nasrabadi (2002), in a study comparing the effect of Benson relaxation method and Recommended Azkar on reduction of patients&#x02019; anxiety status before an abdominal surgery, concluded that Recommended Azkar had more effect on reduction of anxiety compared to Benson relaxation method,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] which shows the effect of relying on God and its role in giving peace to humans. Hosini (2008), in a study on the effect of prayer with emphasis on cognitive processes, showed that during praying, stimulation and activity starts in a special part of a human being's brain. This activity includes processing of the meaning of pray words, which causes recalling the saved information in the memory in addition to their related events and memories. It consequently leads to lowering stress, BP, and heart rate, which gives us the ability to face the high-risk events appropriately.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Peterson <italic>et al</italic>., in a study on patients undergoing open heart surgery, found out that praying was effective on patients&#x02019; rapid recovery as well as control of stress signs.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Vasegh, in a study on Muslim students, showed that although religious beliefs lower anxiety, they cannot reduce stress and depression.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In a study conducted by Rosmarin <italic>et al</italic>., they concluded that remembering God increases the feeling of well-being in psychological and mental dimensions
