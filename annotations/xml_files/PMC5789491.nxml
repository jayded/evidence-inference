Men undergoing this biopsy experience high psychological stress. Different studies recommend techniques as sedation, lidocaine gel intrarectally, periprostatic nerve block alone, or nitrous oxide inhalation as effective methods of analgesia during procedural-related pain or discomfort. We evaluated three techniques for pain relief during TRUSPB and evaluated if there was any increase in the incidence of complications when employing either technique.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Setting:</title><p>Assiut University Hospital, Assiut, Egypt.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Methods:</title><p>Three hundred patients of age 43&#x02013;92-year-old underwent TRUSPBs. Patients were allocated randomly into three equal groups to receive intravenous (IV) diazepam 5 mg slowly (Group I), bilateral periprostatic nerve block by 10 ml of 1% lidocaine solution injected under ultrasound guidance (Group II), or combined IV diazepam and the periprostatic nerve block (Group III).</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Results:</title><p>The mean pain score was 4.95 for patients in Group I, 4.15 for patients in Group II, and 2.18 for patients in Group III with statistically significant findings (<italic>F</italic> = 120.27, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001). TRUSPB under combined IV sedation and local anesthesia had no significant increase in the incidence of complications.</p></sec><sec id="st5"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>Patients should have analgesia during TRUSPB to decrease the procedure pain and to improve tolerance permitting proper aiming for biopsy cores without increasing the patient distress. The combined IV sedation and local periprostatic nerve block are efficient in controlling and limiting pain better than employing each technique alone with no significant increase in complications incidence.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Analgesia</kwd><kwd>biopsy</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>prostate</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostate biopsy (TRUSPB) is considered the procedure of choice for the diagnosis of prostate cancer.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] TRUSPB is usually performed in outpatient clinics and men undergoing this biopsy experience high psychological stress,[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] may be due to the fear of potential cancer diagnosis or the anal route of penetration.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Thus, it is important to develop a simple method to liberate patients from pain during the biopsy.

The use of local anesthesia is controversy; in some opinions, its employment should be individualized at least to improve psychological patient reassurance in rare patients who may experience considerable difficulty in tolerating the procedure.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</p><p>Others believe that men should have the opportunity to receive local anesthesia before TRUSPB aiming to decrease discomfort associated with this procedure.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</p><p>Pain associated with TRUSPB is thought to originate predominantly from the prostate capsule or stroma, where there is a rich network of autonomic fibers. These autonomic nerves convey visceral sensation to the spinal cord. Innervation of the prostate is derived from the caudal roots of S2&#x02013;S5 and the sympathetic chain through the presacral and hypogastric neural plexus. These fibers ramify in the prostatic vascular pedicles, which are located at the posterolateral aspect of the prostate base.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Another source of pain during the prostate biopsy is the rectum, where the sensory innervation is below the dentate line.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, as biopsy needle pierces the rectal wall in an area of decreased sensorium (above the dentate line), most pain provoked by the biopsy needle is considered to originate in the prostate.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>The most commonly used procedures for pain control during TRUSPB are the local application of lidocaine either by intrarectal lidocaine gel or periprostatic lidocaine injection[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and sedation.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Many studies evaluated the intrarectal lidocaine gel use versus periprostatic lidocaine injection or IV sedation alone; for our own knowledge, this was the first study done to compare the combined IV sedation and periprostatic lidocaine injection.</p><p>IV sedation significantly reduced discomfort, fear of introduction of the probe, and alleviated patient anxiety. While the periprostatic nerve block by infiltrating lidocaine at each side of the apex is sufficient to control pain, the lidocaine bolus extends under the Denonvillier's fascia up to the lateral borders of the prostate and the seminal vesicle-prostatic angles.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]</p><p>The improved patient tolerance achieved by effective anesthesia permitted the number of biopsy cores to be increased as necessary without increasing patient's distress.</p><p>Our results are quite similar to Rodriguez <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Alavi <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Wu <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Seymour <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Leibovici <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and Mallick <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] that show the effectiveness of periprostatic nerve block (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001).</p><p>However, our study showed an increased mean pain score than that recorded in studies of Peters <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Turgut <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Ozok <italic>et al</italic>.,[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and Song <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] This may be attributed to different drugs employed in IV sedation [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T4" position="float"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Comparison of randomized prospective studies handling the methods of anesthesia for sonographic-guided prostatic biopsies</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="SJA-12-16-g006"/></table-wrap><p>Furthermore, this study aimed to assess if there is an increase in the incidence of complications when employing either method.

The mean number of biopsies was calculated with no statistical difference; however, fixing number of biopsy per patient is a very difficult matter as the biopsy regimen is tailored on each case according to TRUS findings.</p><p>Second: the assessment of lidocaine toxicity was evaluated on clinical basis only; lidocaine toxicity should be accurately evaluated by evaluation of plasma levels of lidocaine after TRUS biopsy (as the accepted levels when lidocaine is used for regional nerve blocks, plasma levels are usually 3&#x02013;5 &#x003bc;g/ml while toxicities may be observed at 6 &#x003bc;g/ml, but more commonly occur once levels exceed 10 mcg/ml).[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>Third: in spite of midazolam has been the most widely used sedative premedication because of its short half-life, faster onset of sedation, and excellent sedative hypnotic effect without any significant side effects, such as vasculitis.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] However, we used diazepam as it is more available and less expensive, especially for patients in the outpatient clinics.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Patients should have pain relief measures during TRUSPB to decrease the procedure pain and improve patient tolerance permitting proper aiming for biopsy cores and increasing the number of biopsy cores without increasing the patients&#x02019; distress.
