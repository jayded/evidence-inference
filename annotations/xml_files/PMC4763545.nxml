Ten well-trained male athletes cycled at submaximal intensity at 21&#x000b0;C or 33&#x000b0;C in randomized order: first for 20 min while breathing normal air (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 0.21) and then 10 min with F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 0.40 (HOX). At both temperatures, S<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and P<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but not tHb, were increased by HOX. Tskin and perception of exertion and thermal discomfort were higher at 33&#x000b0;C than 21&#x000b0;C (p &#x0003c; 0.01), but independent of F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. T<sub>core</sub> and muscle activity were the same under all conditions (p &#x0003e; 0.07). Blood lactate and heart rate were higher at 33&#x000b0;C than 21&#x000b0;C. In conclusion, during 30 min of submaximal cycling at 21&#x000b0;C or 33&#x000b0;C, T<sub>core</sub>, T<sub>skin</sub> and T<sub>body</sub>, tHb, muscle activity and ratings of perceived exertion and thermal discomfort were the same under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions. Accordingly, breathing hyperoxic air (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 0.40) did not affect thermoregulation under these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Heat stress</kwd><kwd>Hyperthermia</kwd><kwd>Skin blood flow</kwd><kwd>Thermoregulation</kwd><kwd>Vasoconstriction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="S0001"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Several investigators have described the effects of either elevated ambient temperature or inspiration of hyperoxic air (with a greater partial pressure of oxygen than ambient air) during exercise on thermoregulatory, neuromuscular, metabolic, and perceptual responses (e.g., [<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]). In normoxic, warm environments, vasodilatation of subcutaneous vessels accounts for 80-95% of the elevated blood flow in human skin [<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. In contrast, hyperoxia (HOX) during exercise induces constriction of individual vessels [<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], thereby elevating peripheral vascular resistance [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and reducing blood flow in the forearm [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], calf [<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], brain [<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], and thigh [<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>To date, two reports on the impact of HOX and heat in combination have appeared. Upon immersing the legs of participants at rest and breathing air containing 21%, 25% or 30% oxygen in hot water (42&#x000b0;C) for 60 min, Yamashita and Tochihara [<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] observed that HOX inhibited the elevation of blood flow in the skin by heat. In addition, Tomita and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] demonstrated constriction of vascular endothelial cells <italic>in vitro</italic> upon exposure to 100% oxygen, as well as impairment of heat exchange in the skin of resting subjects breathing pure oxygen due to attenuated blood flow in the microvascular network. These findings indicate that HOX-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction reduces heat loss, thereby elevating core temperature. Oxygenation of human skeletal muscle (expressed as the tissue saturation index &#x02013; TSI) [<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], as well as changes in local blood volume (total haemoglobin &#x02013; tHb) [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], potentially reflecting the balance between oxygen supply and utilization [<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>], have been assessed by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS).</p><p>During prolonged submaximal exercise at cool temperatures, core body temperature remains relatively constant. However, humans stop exercising when their core temperature rises above 40.0&#x000b0;C [<xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], primarily due to attenuation of the central neural drive [<xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. At the same time, several researchers have observed enhanced peripheral locomotor muscle activity when the oxygen content of the inspired air (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) is elevated [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. For example, Tucker and co-workers [<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] found that the integrated electromyographic activity (iEMG) of skeletal muscle during a 20-km time trial of cycling was greater under hyperoxic than normoxic conditions. Similarly, peripheral locomotor muscle activity (i.e., iEMG) during high-intensity exercise at the same workload was higher with hyperoxia than normoxia [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>].</p><p>Although HOX is used increasingly as an ergogenic aid for performance and recovery [<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], to date the impact of combined exposure to HOX and heat during exercise on the thermoregulatory, neuromuscular, metabolic, and perceptual responses of male endurance athletes has not been documented. If during submaximal exercise HOX enhances muscle activation, but reduces vascular blood flow, while heat elevates vascular blood flow, but attenuates muscle activation, what will be the final outcome? Here, we compared the effects of HOX (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 0.40) and normoxia (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 0.21) during exercise at 33&#x000b0;C and 21&#x000b0;C to test the hypothesis that HOX is more deleterious for thermoregulatory, neuromuscular, metabolic, and perceptual responses in a warm than a cool environment. Our findings should help to improve protocols for sub-maximal exercise and recovery under different environmental conditions.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>The 10 healthy, non-smoking male volunteers (age 28 &#x000b1; 4 years, body height 184 &#x000b1; 7 cm, body mass 79.7 &#x000b1; 7.8 kg; means &#x000b1; SD) were all well-trained triathletes or cyclists (VO<sub>2peak</sub>: 62.6 mL<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>min<sup>&#x02212;1</sup>

They were asked to be adequately hydrated for the tests and to refrain from consuming alcohol for 24 h and food or caffeine for 3 h prior to each test. Prior to participating, all were informed of the protocol and provided their written consent. All procedures were approved by the ethics committee of the German Sport University in Cologne and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.</p><sec id="S20003"><title>Procedures</title><p>Each participant performed laboratory trials on three separate occasions. During the first visit (pre-test), he received instructions concerning the test procedures, and his appropriate VO<sub>2peak</sub> as well as the workload for the main testing was determined. In addition, body weight (kg) (Tanita BC 418 MA, Tanita Corp., Tokyo, Japan) and height (cm) were measured.</p><p>On the second and third occasions (performance trials), each participant completed one 30-min trial of submaximal cycling at either 21&#x000b0;C or 33&#x000b0;C (both at 30% relative humidity (RH)), in random, counterbalanced order. During these two main trials, each athlete cycled on a stationary ergometer (SRM GmbH, J&#x000fc;lich, Germany) at a fixed power output of approximately 1.5-2.0 W<bold>&#x000b7;</bold>kg<sup>&#x02212;1</sup> (i.e., 157.0 &#x000b1; 15.0 W), depending on his level of fitness, for 30 minutes (min): the first 20 min under normoxic conditions and thereafter for 10 min while inhaling O<sub>2</sub>-enriched air (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 0.40) from a Douglas bag (Hans Rudolph Inc, Shawnee, KS, USA) through plastic tubing attached to a mouthpiece. During all testing the participants wore only cycling pants and shoes.</p><p>Blood samples were collected from the right earlobe into capillary tubes (Eppendorf AG, Hamburg, Germany) immediately before beginning, and after 5, 18, 23 and 28 min of cycling (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).

Inc., Bend, OR, USA) and was ingested two hours before beginning to cycle and transmitted once every 60 s to an external receiver (Mini Mitter Co. Inc., Bend, OR) located close to the cyclists&#x02019; lumbar region [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The reliability of this procedure for continuous monitoring of core body temperature has been validated in several sport and occupational studies [<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Employing adhesive sensors, skin temperature (T<sub>skin</sub>) could also be recorded telemetrically once every 60 s by the same receiver. Mean skin temperature was then calculated according to the following modification of the equation developed by Hardy and Dubois (1938) [<xref rid="CIT0026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]: T<sub>skin</sub> = 0.073&#x000b7;T<sub>hand</sub> + 0.163&#x000b7;T<sub>forearm</sub> + 0.203&#x000b7;T<sub>chest</sub> + 0.193&#x000b7;T<sub>back</sub> + 0.213&#x000b7;T<sub>thigh</sub> + 0.153&#x000b7;T<sub>calf</sub>. Mean body temperature (T<sub>body</sub>) was calculated using the temperature-weighted equation: T<sub>body</sub> = 0.65&#x000b7;T<sub>core</sub> + 0.35&#x000b7;T<sub>skin</sub> [<xref rid="CIT0027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Alterations in the total tissue level of haemoglobin concentration (tHb) and oxygen saturation (SO<sub>2</sub>) were measured at 6 different sites on the right side of the body using the moorVMS-OXY system (Moor Instruments Ltd., Devon, UK), which analyses back-scattered light with a wavelength of 500-650 nm. The sites monitored were (1) above the m. <italic>pectoralis major</italic>, (2) the upper back (m. <italic>trapezius</italic> between the inferior angles of the scapulae), (3) the lower back above the m. <italic>erector spinae</italic>, (4) the m. <italic>vastus lateralis</italic>, (5) the lower arm (m. <italic>supinator</italic>), and (6) between the thumb and index finger (m. <italic>abductor pollicis brevis</italic>). For measurement of cutaneous levels of haemoglobin, an optical fibre probe was employed.</p><p>The neuromuscular activities of the m. <italic>vastus medialis</italic>, <italic>semitendinosus</italic>, and <italic>gastrocnemius medialis</italic> in the right leg were monitored by surface EMG (TeleMyo 2400T; Noraxon Inc., Scottsdale, AZ, USA). For this purpose, pre-gelled bipolar electrodes were placed on the muscle belly in alignment with the underlying fibres, in accordance with international standards [<xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], and a reference electrode attached to the acromion. Prior to electrode placement, the skin was shaved, abraded slightly and cleaned with alcohol. All EMG signals were amplified (differential amplifier, Biovision, Werheim, Germany), filtered through a hardware band-pass (10&#x02013;500 Hz at 3 dB), converted to digital units (DAQ 700 A/D card -12 bit, National Instruments, Austin, TX, USA), sampled at 1,000 Hz, and analysed with version 1.06.50 of the MyoResearch software (Noraxon USA Inc., Scottsdale, SZ, USA). Prior to further processing, all of these signals were full-wave rectified. To compare the intensities of activation, the integrated EMG (iEMG) of each muscle was calculated to obtain an indicator of the tension developed and the mean power frequency (MPF). These EMG parameters were determined at four different time points (i.e., after 5, 18, 23 and 30 min of cycling) and averaged across 20 revolutions of the pedals (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="S20004"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>In a pilot study on two separate days, measurement of the power output of the ergometer revealed a technical error [%TEM] of 1.7%.

As reported previously, local alterations in blood volume reflect changes in blood flow assuming that no alterations in erythrocyte velocity occur [<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Consequently, oxygen delivery to the muscle can be assessed by NIRS.</p><p>In several investigations hyperoxia-induced vasoconstriction at various sites of the body during rest has been observed [<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>], but to date only two have examined the effects of hyperoxia in a hot environment. Thus, Yamazaki and colleagues (2007) showed that hyperoxia (S<sub>a</sub>O<sub>2</sub>=99.8%) in combination with hyperthermia induces cutaneous vasoconstriction [<xref rid="CIT0030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our present findings are in agreement with those of Rousseau [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and Yamazaki [<xref rid="CIT0031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and co-workers in that hyperoxia-induced cutaneous vasoconstriction was observed only in areas of the skin exhibiting elevated basal blood flow. Rousseau and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] noted that cutaneous blood flow is regulated primarily by factors other than the supply of oxygen. On the basis of our present observations, we propose that heat-induced vasodilatation counteracts any vasoconstriction evoked by hyperoxia [<xref rid="CIT0033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S20008"><title>Core body temperature</title><p>We observed only a slight increase in core body temperature during 30 min of submaximal cycling, with no significant difference between normoxic and HOX conditions. However, the effect sizes here were large, which is consistent with the lack of any significant difference in mean skin temperature. At the same time, differences in core body temperature under hyperoxic and normoxic conditions may arise if the duration of exercise is extended [<xref rid="CIT0034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="S20009"><title>Muscle activation during exposure to both hyperoxia and heat</title><p>Several investigators have demonstrated that both the frequency components of EMG signals (i.e., iEMG and MPF) and the conduction velocity of muscle fibres during voluntary isometric contractions (20, 40, 60, and 80% of maximal voluntary contraction) are dependent on skin temperature [<xref rid="CIT0035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. However, we could not detect any differences between iEMG and MPF at 21&#x000b0;C or 33&#x000b0;C at any time point.</p><p>Alterations in the properties of EMG signals in connection with changes in skin temperature might be influenced by modifications in the properties of fibre membranes [<xref rid="CIT0036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], which influence the recruitment of muscles for low-level contractions by the alpha motoneurons. In this context, direct modification of the contractile properties of motor units due to changes in fibre membrane conduction induced by temperature has been observed [<xref rid="CIT0037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].</p><p>In this study, hyperoxia did not influence muscle activity at either 21&#x000b0;C or 33&#x000b0;C. During constant high-intensity cycling, Amann and co-workers [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] found a significantly higher iEMG with normoxic (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub>=0.21) than hypoxic (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub>=1.00) breathing and concluded that the level of oxygen influences the rate at which locomotor muscle fatigue develops. However, in the present investigation the duration of exercise (30 min) was much longer than that employed by Amann et al. [<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] (~5 min) and the intensity lower, suggesting that at lower intensities the availability of oxygen does not limit muscle activation. In agreement, Taylor and colleagues [<xref rid="CIT0038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] found more extensive activation of a muscle during submaximal cycling at a fixed power output under hypoxic (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub>=0.12) than normoxic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S20010"><title>Blood concentration of lactate</title><p>Under hyperoxic conditions in this study, the lactate concentration in blood was lower at 21&#x000b0;C than 33&#x000b0;C. Improvements in exercise performance (e.g., power output) associated with heating have been shown to be closely related to activation of muscle fibres. For example, muscles containing a higher percentage of type I fibres show more improvement in power output at 44&#x000b0;C than do muscles with a high proportion of type II fibres [<xref rid="CIT0039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. If this is the case, due to their higher content of mitochondria and enzymes involved in oxidative phosphorylation, type I fibres probably benefit more from aerobic metabolism, which would explain why lactate clearance in this study was more pronounced under normoxic conditions.</p></sec><sec id="S20011"><title>Subjective variables</title><p>In the present study, perceived exertion under normoxic and hyperoxic conditions was similar, which is consistent with previous findings. For example, elite kayakers reported no difference in the quality of their recovery after exercise under normoxic or hyperoxic (F = 0.99) conditions [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. In contrast, Peeling and Andersson reported reduced self-reported feelings of dyspnoea and respiratory exertion and enhanced cognitive function and cerebral oxygenation when a higher concentration of oxygen was provided [<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, our present data indicate that hyperoxia probably does not lower the exertion and thermal discomfort felt by individuals exercising at 33&#x000b0;C.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S0012"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>Our present findings demonstrate that exposure to hyperoxic air (F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub> = 0.40) during 30 min of submaximal cycling at 21&#x000b0;C or 33&#x000b0;C does not influence the total level of haemoglobin in the skin, core body temperature, muscle activity, or perceived exertion. However, the elevation in blood lactate caused by heat is attenuated by elevated F<sub>in</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Thus, our hypothesis that HOX in a warm environment exerts deleterious effects on thermoregulatory, neuromuscular, metabolic, and perceptual responses was not confirmed. HOX is being used increasingly by athletes as an ergogenic aid for performance and recovery, and our present findings indicate that such use during recovery under hot environmental conditions might enhance metabolite clearance from the blood. Both training and competition may take place under hot conditions, and we conclude that the use of HOX will not influence thermoregulation negatively.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank all athletes for their participation, commitment, and enthusiasm, making this project possible.
