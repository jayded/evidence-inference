It occurs nearly 1 in 500 to 1:1250 live births.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] There are two types of ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) &#x02013; more common intrinsic and the extrinsic variety.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The main indications for active interventions are to relieve obstruction, relieve pain, to preserve renal function and/or treat pathologies secondary to such obstruction like calculi and infections.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Recent improvements in pre-natal ultrasonography now allow most of the cases to be diagnosed <italic>in utero</italic>.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Obviously, for patients of any age, a reconstructive procedure is always indicated whenever overall renal function is compromised because of involvement in a solitary kidney or bilateral disease.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] UPJO may not become apparent until middle age or later.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] However, the majority of affected patients can in fact benefit from reconstructive intervention.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] When intervention is indicated, the procedure of choice is the repair of PUJ i.e. pyeloplasty.</p><p>Surgical management of UPJO has recently been revolutionized by the introduction and widespread adoption of minimally invasive techniques as alternative to standard open reconstructive procedures in an effort to reduce the morbidity of the treatment. Initially, minimally invasive approaches included antegrade and retrograde endoscopic endopyelotomy. Although, these procedures are associated with relatively few complications, brief hospitalization and little disability, the reported success rates are lower (71_ 88%) as compared to open approach, and it has limited indications. Also these procedures have an increased risk of hemorrhage.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This prospective study was conducted in Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, India, in the Department of Urology from October 2007 to December 2011. Total no of patients were 35. Patients were divided in two groups as Group A (stent less, 18 patients) and Group B (stented, 17 patients). Age, gender, and preoperative differential renal function were recorded in all patients. Group A patients were explained the procedure to undergo stentless transperitoneal laparoscopic pyeloplasty and the need for stent placement, if any, in postoperative period, and the Group B patients were explained the procedure to undergo laparoscopic stented pyeloplasty. Indications for surgery were decrease in differential renal function (DRF) in presence of symptoms, decrease in DRF of more than 10% than previous reading in an asymptomatic patient, or decrease in DRF of &#x02265;25% at any point in time, in presence or absence of symptoms, supported by diuretic renographic evidence of UPJO. The decision for not using the stent was based on patient's preference after explaining the pros and cons of the procedure, and surgeon's decision. All patients were preoperatively assessed with history, physical examination, abdominal ultrasound and X--ray kidney, ureter, and bladder (KUB), Intravenous ureterogram (I.V.U), and diuretic renal scan. All patients had radiographic evidence of UPJO and hydronephrosis on diuretic renography and I.V.U. Laboratory tests like complete blood picture, kidney function test, and urine routine and culture were done in all patients.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were patients with stone, active infection, children below 6 years of age, and renal units of PUJ obstruction with glomerular filtration rate (GFR) less than 15 ml/minute.</p><p>All patients were kept on liquid diet 1_day prior to surgery. Patients were given parentral cephalosporins and Amikacin at the time of induction of anesthesia and these antibiotics were continued postoperatively till the time of drain removal. All procedures were performed under general anesthesia. Foleys catheter was placed in the bladder in all patients before positioning. All procedures were carried out via laparoscopic transperitoneal approach and by a single surgeon. Pneumoperitoneum was created by closed technique by Veres needle and carbon dioxide gas. Three ports were placed in a standard way with variation in position as per the body habitus. Approach to the PUJ area was made by mobilizing the colon by incising the peritoneum laterally. The ureter was identified and dissected in cephalad direction to achieve mobilization of proximal ureter, ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) and renal pelvis. The pelvis was divided, diseased segment excised, watertight, spatulated uretero-pelvic anastomosis performed with a wide funnel shaped dependent new PUJ, taking care of any rotation/ twisting of the ureter. In cases of difficulty in spatulation, the ureter was brought outside body through lower working port and spatulated extra corporally (in three and two cases in Group A and B respectively). Pyeloureteral anastomosis was done with vicryl 4/0 continuous suture.</p><p>We found no difference in beginning with either posteriorly or anteriorly except that starting from anterior margin was more convenient. After completion of anterior suture line at UPJ, double J stent was indwelled in group B patients via 10 mm port, loading the stent on guide wire, and with the help of pusher. An infant feeding tube (5Fr or 6 Fr ) was placed in the ureter as a temporary splint to facilitate anastomosis. Water tight, funnel shaped, dependent anastomosis was made. A tube drain size 20 Fr was placed near the anastomosis site. Post operative complications (pain, high and or prolonged drain output, urinoma and fever), hospital stay and improvement in renal functional outcomes on technetium 99m diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (Tc 99 DTPA) renal scan were recorded.</p><p>Drain was removed in the post operative period when its output decreases to lessthan 50 ml in 24hr. patients with continuous drainage &#x0003e;600 ml on 3rd/4th pod were discharged along with drain and were explained in detail about daily recording of drain output for 24 hrs and communicated on phone. Foley's catheter was removed first followed by drain removal. In case of stented group Foley's catheter was removed after 2 days and drain was removed once output &#x0003c;50 ml. (after catheter removal)</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Follow up</title><p>The decision for postoperative DJ stenting in stentless pyeloplasty was made if there was persistent high drain output for more than 10 days. The follow up schedule included a visit after 7 post operative day for port site clip removal and clinical examination followed by three week visit with urine analysis and detailed symptomatology and clinical examination. Diuretic renogram was done at third and or sixth month of surgery to compare with pre-operative renal scan in both Group A and Group B.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>In our study all patients had primary UPJO.

The demographic profile, pre op/ post op t<sub>max</sub> and DRF is given in Tables <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref> for group A and B patients, respectively. Mean age was 28 and 31 years in group A and B, respectively. All patients had proven significant obstruction on Tc 99 DTPA renal scan. Mean operative time was 180 mts (range155-210 mts) and mean blood loss was 50 ml (range 20-100 ml) in both the groups. In Group A patients mean duration of post operative Foley's catheter was 2 days. Drain output ranged from 500-1200 ml on first postoperative day that decreased gradually in 16 patients and drain was removed from 3rd to 5th postoperative day (mean 4 days). Two patients had persistent drainage &#x0003e;600 ml/24 hrs on 5<sup>th</sup> postoperative day and were discharged along with drain which was removed on 7<sup>th</sup> pod in one and 8<sup>th</sup> pod in another patient. One patient had high grade fever and vomiting on 10<sup>th</sup> pod. As the drain was removed on 3<sup>rd</sup> pod, possibly drain was blocked in immediate postoperative period. Ultrasound KUB showed features of perirenal urinoma. Subsequently DJ stent was inserted by the same surgeon with position of DJ stent checked on fluoroscopy. He was put on injectable antibiotics and hospitalized for 2-days till fever subsided. None of the patients had any signs of peritonitis or evidence of bowel injury in the post operative period.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Demography, t<sub>max</sub> and DRF, both pre operatively and post operatively in Group A patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="UA-6-202-g001"/></table-wrap><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Demography, t<sub>max</sub> and DRF, both pre operatively and post operatively in Group B patients</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="UA-6-202-g002"/></table-wrap><p>In group B patients, Foley's catheter was removed after a mean of 2 days and drain was removed on 3<sup>rd</sup> pod (when 24 hr drain output was &#x0003c;50 ml).

Laparoscopic pyeloplasty is continuously evolving with various modifications to simplify the technique to make it a truly minimally invasive approach. There has been an ongoing debate on the merits of intubated versus non-intubated (stentless) repair of UPJO done either by laparoscopic or open technique. Despite high success rate, open pyeloplasty has the disadvantage of a loin wound and consequent increased morbidity and long convalescence.</p><p>Dismembered pyeloplasty is the popular operation when there is dyskinetic segment or proximal ureter is hooked over lower pole blood vessels.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] The use of stenting catheters and proximal diversion at the time of pyeloplasty has been the subject of debate. Excellent results have been reported both with and without stents and diversion.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Stents and nephrostomy tubes, once considered integral part of pediatric reconstructive surgery are now rarely placed.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Most pediatric urologists now believe that routine use of stents and nephrostomy tubes is no longer indicated and is reserved for complicated cases.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]</p><p>Laparoscopic pyeloplasty was originally developed by Schuessler <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] in an attempt to duplicate the results of open pyeloplasty while simultaneously decreasing postoperative morbidity. Since then several groups have reported its successful use.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Although associated with greater technical complexity and a steeper learning curve, in the hands of the experienced laparoscopic surgeons it has been shown to provide lower patient morbidity, shorter hospitalization, and faster convalescence with the reported success rate matching those of open pyeloplasty (90% or higher).[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] More recently, with advancing laparoscopic skills and the introduction of robotic assisted surgery, many centers have moved to laparoscopic pyeloplasty as first-line therapy.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Improved suturing skills and the use of robotic assistance have greatly facilitated laparoscopic dismembered pyeloplasty for primary and secondary repairs.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The use of ureteral stents following pyeloplasty ensures adequate drainage, particularly in the presence of postoperative edema.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] The advantage of stent placement following pyeloplasty include: Lowering the risk of urinoma formation in the event of leak, thereby reducing periureteric fibrosis and restenosis,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and providing support and alignment of the fresh suture line.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] The importance of the stent is highlighted when the anastomosis is not watertight, or after endopyelotomy, allowing healing of the defect while urine is diverted by the stent. However, ureteral stents are not free from risk, and potential problems include irritative urinary symptoms, flank pain and increased risk of infection,[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] migration, encrustation, retained or forgotten fragments,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] exposure of the upper urinary tract to high pressure during urination, and need for additional procedure for removal. Although, the role of stents has been well described after endopyelotomy, its role after laparoscopic pyeloplasty, where water tight closure can be achieved remains to be evaluated.</p><p>More recently, there seems to have been a trend towards non stented repairs.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] It is of interest to mention the comment from Anderson and Hynes on their technique, &#x0201c;We are convinced that the so called splinting of any anastomosis is not only unnecessary but it is against all the principles of plastic procedure, as it leads to fibrosis at the suture and subsequent stricture. The line of anastomosis should be wide enough and so fashioned as to render any subsequent contraction innocuous&#x0201d;. They did not drain the pelvis or use a trans-anastomotic tube/stent.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Stent has been found to be associated with stent syndrome (defined as dysuria, frequency, flank pain and hematuria commonly seen with short term placement of ureteral stents), interfere with daily activities and result in reduced quality of life.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Stents act as foreign bodies causing compromised vascularity and fibrosis at anastomotic site[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Joshi <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] in their study on indwelling ureteral stents reported that 78% patients had bothersome urinary symptoms that included storage symptoms, incontinence and hematuria.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] More than 80% of patients experienced stent related pain affecting daily activities, 32% reported sexual dysfunction, and 58% reported reduced work capacity and negative economic impact. In our study in stented pyeloplasty group, 11 (65%) patients had irritative lower urinary tract symptoms needing treatment. Though stent can be removed under local anesthesia in adults, its removal requires general anesthesia in children. The benefits of stentless pyeloplasty are reduced risk of infection, avoiding the risk of developing stent syndrome, and avoiding need for cystoscopic removal after 1 month.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>The complications noted in our study in stentless pyeloplasty group were urinoma in one patient (5.5%), two patients (11%) had persistent drainage on 5<sup>th</sup> pod and were discharged along with drain, similar to the observations made by Bilen CY <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] They concluded that laparoscopic stentless pyeloplasty is as feasible technique as its stented counterpart. Although, it has relatively high prolonged leakage risk, it could be performed without compromising the success rate in experienced hands.</p><p>In stented group, one patient (5.8%) developed secondary UPJO on follow up after stent removal. Retrograde endopyelotomy was done in him. It seems that stent does not replace the need of good technique of surgery and it cannot prevent re-stenosis if surgical principles are not adhered to. In our study, there was failure of laparoscopic pyeloplasty (5.8%) even when stent was placed. Smith KE <italic>et al.</italic>[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in a study in the pediatric population concluded that stent less pyeloplasty is a safe procedure. In a study by Pasquale casale <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] they concluded that stentless robotic assisted pyeloplasty is a safe and effective option for surgical treatment of UPJO. A larger prospective long-term cohort is needed to confirm the safety and efficacy of the stent less approach. In a similar study conducted by Sethi AS <italic>et al.</italic> (2010)[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] it was suggested that non stented robotic assisted pyeloplasty is a safe and feasible procedure for the treatment of ureteropelvic junction obstruction. There were no clinically significant differences between the stented and unstented groups in their study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In experienced hand laparoscopic stentless pyeloplasty is as effective method for treating UPJO as its stented counterpart. Although, it has a relatively high initial prolonged urine leakage and prolonged hospital stay, it avoids stent related morbidity, is cost effective, and could be performed without compromising the success rate. However, since the number of patients in our study is limited, more work has to be done to evaluate the safety of stentless pyeloplasty. In our preliminary experience, we find that stent is not a mandatory requirement in pyeloplasty and there is no compromise in the outcome, while avoiding stent related problems at the same
