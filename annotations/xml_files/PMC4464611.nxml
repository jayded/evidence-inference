According to analyses of prescription prevalence in Germany, antipsychotic drugs are regularly prescribed as first-line treatment of neuropsychiatric symptoms in persons with dementia, although guidelines clearly prioritise non-pharmacological interventions. Frequently, antipsychotic drugs are prescribed for inappropriate reasons and for too long without regular reviewing. The use of antipsychotics is associated with adverse events like increased risk of falling, stroke, and mortality. The aim of the study is to investigate whether a person-centred care approach, successfully evaluated in nursing homes in the United Kingdom, can be implemented in German nursing homes and, in comparison with a control group, can result in a clinically relevant reduction of the proportion of residents with antipsychotic prescriptions.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The study is a cluster-randomised controlled trial comparing an intervention group (two-day initial training on person-centred care and ongoing training and support programme) with a control group. Both study groups will receive, as optimised usual care, a medication review by an experienced psychiatrist/geriatrician providing feedback to the prescribing physician. Overall, 36 nursing homes in East, North, and West Germany will be randomised. The primary outcome is the proportion of residents receiving at least one antipsychotic prescription (long-term medication) after 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up. Secondary outcomes are residents&#x02019; quality of life, agitated behaviour, as well as safety parameters like falls and fall-related medical attention. A health economic evaluation and a process evaluation will be performed alongside the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>To improve care, a reduction of the current high prescription rate of antipsychotics in nursing homes by the intervention programme is expected.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02295462">NCT02295462</ext-link></p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (doi:10.1186/s13012-015-0268-3) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Implementation research</kwd><kwd>Nursing homes</kwd><kwd>Dementia</kwd><kwd>Antipsychotic agents</kwd><kwd>Person-centred care</kwd><kwd>Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Background</title><p>Prescription rates of antipsychotic drugs for residents in German nursing homes are considerably high [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>] and have not changed for years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Recent data show that antipsychotics are prescribed for almost 30&#x000a0;% of German nursing home residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Studies indicate that up to two thirds of antipsychotics for residents are prescribed for inappropriate reasons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Furthermore, antipsychotics are often prescribed for too long without carrying out a regular review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Both long-term and short-term use of antipsychotics increase mortality compared to non-users [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], with cardiac death and infections being the main causes. All antipsychotics are associated with an increased risk of stroke, and the risk might even be higher in patients/residents receiving atypical antipsychotics compared to those receiving conventional antipsychotics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Adverse effects also include sedation, dizziness and increased risk of falling and fall-related injuries, tremor and rigidity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], worsening of cognitive function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], and other effects which are most likely to result in reduced quality of life (QoL) and well-being as well as withdrawal from social life and participation.</p><p>Antipsychotics are mostly prescribed to control behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. BPSD are a meaningful clinical target for interventions since restlessness, agitation, aggression, delusions, apathy, disinhibition, and hallucinations are highly prevalent among residents with dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and pose a major challenge for nursing home staff, frequently leading to distress in patients and carers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. The majority of residents with dementia experience BPSD at some point of the dementia trajectory, even in early stages of dementia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. These symptoms are highly consistent over the course of five years with a tendency to increase over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. International and national clinical practice guidelines recommend that psychological and environmental approaches should be the first treatment option of BPSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], since non-pharmacological interventions individually tailored to the person with dementia are effective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. To meet individual needs of residents and improve their QoL, the person-centred care (PCC) approach seems to be appropriate. One highly recognised concept has been introduced by Kitwood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. The components of this concept are to regard personhood in people with dementia as increasingly concealed rather than lost, to acknowledge the personhood of each individual in all aspects of care, to personalise care and environment, to offer shared decision-making, to interpret behaviour from the viewpoint of the person with dementia, and to prioritise the relationship as much as the care tasks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Personalised activities were effective at reducing agitation in care home residents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Drugs should only be used as a last resort and should be discontinued immediately after symptoms vanish or improve over a period of 3&#x000a0;months [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. Thus, nursing homes are urgently requested to strive for a decrease of antipsychotics prescribed for BPSD in favour of non-pharmacological treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Systematic reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>] indicate that training and support for care home staff reduce prescription of antipsychotics in residents with dementia and can be viable alternatives for managing BPSD. The most recent and most rigorous trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], which is the basis for the present study, demonstrates the strongest effect without adverse events. In addition to a PCC approach, a review of drugs was conducted by an old-age psychiatrist taking part in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. After 12&#x000a0;months, the proportion of residents receiving antipsychotics in the intervention homes (23.0&#x000a0;%) was significantly lower than in the control homes (42.1&#x000a0;%) with an average reduction in antipsychotic use of 19.1&#x000a0;% (95&#x000a0;% confidence interval 0.5 to 37.7&#x000a0;%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>].</p><p>Summarising, to evaluate the intervention programme by Fossey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] seems to be the most promising approach, although the programme requires a thorough adaptation to the German long-term care and health system.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Trial objective</title><p>The aim of our study is to investigate whether a PCC approach, successfully evaluated in nursing homes in the United Kingdom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>], can be implemented in German nursing homes and, in comparison with a control group, can result in a clinically relevant reduction of the proportion of residents with antipsychotic prescriptions. Our <italic>primary outcome</italic> is the proportion of residents with at least one antipsychotic prescription (long-term medication) after 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up.</p><p>A further aim is to investigate whether QoL will improve or at least be unchanged as shown by Fossey et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In accordance with the results of the primary efficacy study and a Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>], we assume that the intervention is not only effective but also does not harm the residents, i.e. dementia-related BPSD will not worsen in the intervention group, and prescription rates of other psychotropic medication as well as the application of physical restraints will not increase.

A process evaluation will also be performed, aiming to comprehensively analyse the underlying processes as well as the barriers and facilitators of the implementation of this multicomponent intervention, giving special focus to regional differences.
