This paper describes the experiences and determinants of stigma reported by the primary caregivers of people living with schizophrenia (PLS) in India. The study used mixed methods and was nested in a randomised controlled trial of community care for people with schizophrenia. Between November 2009 and October 2010, data on caregiver stigma and functional outcomes were collected from a sample of 282 PLS&#x02013;caregiver dyads. In addition, 36 in-depth-interviews were conducted with caregivers. Quantitative findings indicate that &#x02018;high caregiver stigma&#x02019; was reported by a significant minority of caregivers (21%) and that many felt uncomfortable to disclose their family member's condition (45%). Caregiver stigma was independently associated with higher levels of positive symptoms of schizophrenia, higher levels of disability, younger PLS age, household education at secondary school level and research site. Knowledge about schizophrenia was not associated with caregiver stigma. Qualitative data illustrate the various ways in which stigma affected the lives of family caregivers and reveal relevant links between caregiver-stigma related themes (&#x02018;others finding out&#x02019;, &#x02018;negative reactions&#x02019; and &#x02018;negative feelings and views about the self&#x02019;) and other themes in the data.</p><p>Findings highlight the need for interventions that address both the needs of PLS and their family caregivers. Qualitative data also illustrate the complexities surrounding the relationship between knowledge and stigma and suggest that providing &#x02018;knowledge about schizophrenia&#x02019; may influence the process of stigmatisation in both positive and negative ways. We posit that educational interventions need to consider context-specific factors when choosing anti-stigma-messages to be conveyed. Our findings suggest that messages such as &#x02018;recovery is possible&#x02019; and &#x02018;no-one is to blame&#x02019; may be more helpful than focusing on bio-medical knowledge alone.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="author-highlights" id="abs0015"><title>Highlights</title><p><list list-type="simple"><list-item id="u0010"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Experiences of being blamed and worries about marital prospects were salient.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0015"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Caregivers' and PLS' experiences of stigma were determined by similar factors.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0020"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Knowledge was linked to stigma in qualitative but not in quantitative analyses.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0025"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Context-specific messages rather than biomedical knowledge may help reduce stigma.</p></list-item><list-item id="u0030"><label>&#x02022;</label><p>Family caregivers need access to emotional and social support in their own right.</p></list-item></list></p></abstract><kwd-group id="kwrds0010"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Stigma</kwd><kwd>Discrimination</kwd><kwd>Knowledge</kwd><kwd>Schizophrenia</kwd><kwd>Mental illness</kwd><kwd>Caregiver</kwd><kwd>Family</kwd><kwd>India</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><label>1</label><title>Introduction</title><p>Problems related to stigma do not only affect persons suffering from mental illness but also families (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Corrigan et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">Phelan et&#x000a0;al., 1998</xref>). In his seminal work on stigma in the 1960s, Goffman already reflected upon the stigma that spills over to families, coining the term &#x02018;courtesy stigma&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Goffmann, 1963</xref>). The negative impact of this form of stigma (which we will refer to as &#x02018;family stigma&#x02019;) may be particularly marked in settings where family cohesion is high. In India, as in many low and middle-income countries (LAMIC), most people living with schizophrenia (PLS) live with their families and rely on them for both economic support and everyday care (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Thara, 1993</xref>). Thus, family members are closely involved in most aspects of PLS&#x02019; care and often maintain control of help-seeking and treatment decisions, assuming many of the roles filled by health or social care staff in high-income country (HIC) settings (<xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">Nunley, 1998</xref>). The high quality of family support provided to many PLS in India is likely to reflect a widely held social norm that no one should have to live alone because of their illness (<xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">Thara, 1993</xref>).</p><p>At the same time, studies in India also document how, in the absence of adequate health and social care, particularly in life domains such as finances, family relationships, well-being and health, family members of PLS cope with enormous caregiver burden (<xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">Kumar et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Stigma adds to the burden of caregiving and affects the lives of family members of PLS in multiple ways. For example, research from South India has found that family caregivers of PLS were often concerned that other family members would not be able to marry or that friends, relatives or neighbours might avoid or treat them differently (<xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Raguram et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Thara et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Thara and Srinivasan, 2000</xref>). Similar findings have been reported for other LAMIC (<xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">Chien et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">Shibre et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>) and several HIC (<xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Larson and Corrigan, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Lack of knowledge about mental illness has been described as one of the components of the stigma construct itself, for example in Thornicroft's conceptualisation of stigma as an overarching construct consisting of problems of knowledge (ignorance), attitudes (prejudice) and behaviour (discrimination) (<xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Thornicroft, 2006</xref>). Many anti-stigma interventions aim to improve knowledge about mental illness (<xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">Mehta et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>) and health care interventions for family members of PLS often focus on &#x02018;knowledge about schizophrenia&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">Sin and Norman, 2013</xref>). Poorer knowledge about mental illness has been linked to stigmatising attitudes in several studies (<xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">Jorm et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib54" ref-type="bibr">Thornicroft, 2006</xref>), but little is known about the links between knowledge about mental illness and subjective stigma experience, particularly among family members. A better understanding of this relationship may inform efforts to reduce the impact of stigma, for example by suggesting messages to be conveyed in educational interventions (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Clement et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Findings on the experiences of stigma of PLS taking part in this study have been reported previously in this journal (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The aim of the present paper is to describe caregivers&#x02019; own experiences of stigma, and the factors influencing these experiences in India. We also examine the hypothesis that caregivers with lower levels of knowledge about schizophrenia experience higher levels of stigma.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><label>2</label><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><label>2.1</label><title>Setting</title><p>The study was nested in a randomised controlled trial of collaborative community care for PLS in India (COPSI trial) which was implemented in three diverse settings: in rural Tamil Nadu by the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF), and in two mixed urban and rural sites, Goa and Satara (Maharashtra), by the NGOs &#x02018;Sangath&#x02019;, &#x02018;Parivarthan&#x02019; and &#x02018;Nirmittee&#x02019; in collaboration with private psychiatrists. Methods and findings of the COPSI trial have been described elsewhere (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balaji et&#x000a0;al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balaji et&#x000a0;al., 2012b</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). The nested study on stigma used cross-sectional data collected at the point of entry into the trial and employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data from all PLS and caregivers in the trial and qualitative data from a purposively selected subsample of PLS and caregivers. The methods used have been described in detail in our publication on PLS&#x02019; experiences of stigma (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), and will therefore only be summarised briefly here.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.2"><label>2.2</label><title>Recruitment and sampling</title><p>The quantitative sample for the study comprised all PLS and caregivers recruited for the COPSI trial (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;282 PLS-caregiver dyads). Eligibility criteria for PLS were: i) age 16&#x02013;60 years; ii) a primary diagnosis of schizophrenia by ICD-10 DCR criteria (<xref rid="bib64" ref-type="bibr">WHO, 1992</xref>); iii) illness duration of at least 12 months and an overall moderate severity of the illness based on the Clinical Global Impression-Schizophrenia(CGI-SCH) scale rating (<xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">Haro et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>); and iv) residing within the study catchment area for the duration of the study. One primary caregiver (usually the family member most closely involved with the PLS in everyday life) was recruited for each PLS.</p><p>For the qualitative study component, a purposive sampling technique was utilised in an effort to ensure adequate sample variability for PLS gender, severity of illness according to the PANSS (<xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">Kay et&#x000a0;al., 1987</xref>), highest education level in the household and research site. In order to facilitate the in-depth study of experiences of stigma and discrimination, there was oversampling of dyads in which PLS reported higher levels of negative discrimination according to the DISC negative discrimination scale (<xref rid="bib55" ref-type="bibr">Thornicroft et&#x000a0;al., 2009</xref>) Overall, 36 PLS-caregiver dyads were recruited to allow for adequate numbers in each sampling category.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.3"><label>2.3</label><title>Data collection</title><p>Quantitative data on caregiver stigma were collected using an adapted version of the stigma section of the Family Interview Schedule, which had been developed for the International Study of Schizophrenia (<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr">Sartorius and Janca, 1996</xref>) and previously used in a similar population in India (<xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Thara and Srinivasan, 2000</xref>). It comprised of 10 items on stigma experience (e.g. <italic>&#x02018;you worried that your neighbours would treat you differently&#x02019;</italic>) that were scored from &#x02018;not at all&#x02019; to &#x02018;a lot&#x02019; (scores 0&#x02013;3). In addition, caregivers rated their willingness to disclose their relative's illness on a single item scored on a Likert scale ranging from 1-5 (<italic>&#x02018;In general, how comfortable would you feel talking to a friend or family member about your ill family member's mental health, for example telling them he/she has a mental health diagnosis and how it affects him/her and the family?&#x02019;</italic>), adapted from a similar item for people with mental illness (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib57" ref-type="bibr">TNS UK Care Services Improvement Partnership, 2009</xref>). Caregivers knowledge about schizophrenia was measured using the Knowledge About Schizophrenia Interview (KASI) (<xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">Barrowclough et&#x000a0;al., 1987</xref>), which assesses six domains of understanding: Knowledge about diagnosis, symptomatology, aetiology, medication, course and prognosis and management.</p><p>A standardised process of translation and validation of tools was followed, as has been described previously (<xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et&#x000a0;al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">Chatterjee et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Measures on stigma underwent an additional process of validation through focus group discussions involving PLS, caregiver and mental health staff representatives. Three items of the Family Interview Schedule (two on coping strategies and one on general illness impact) were removed to ensure all items used related directly to experiences of stigma.</p><p>Data collection took place between November 2009 and October 2010, prior to trial procedures starting. Quantitative data was collected using programmed palmtop computers and pen and paper methods. In addition, semi-structured in-depth-interviews were carried out with a subsample of the PLS and caregivers recruited for the trial.</p><p>The guide for qualitative interviews was developed in a collaborative, step-wise process involving research teams and local clinicians in all study sites and was tested and adapted in a series of 27 formative and 24 pilot interviews (<xref rid="bib2" ref-type="bibr">Balaji et&#x000a0;al., 2012a</xref>, <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">Balaji et&#x000a0;al., 2012b</xref>). Ongoing data analysis served to continually refine the phrasing of interview questions and probes.</p><p>Interviews were held in the local languages of the sites (Konkani, Marathi or Tamil) or in English, as preferred by the participants. Care was taken to carry out interviews in private, either in the family's home or at another location nearby. Interviews were audio-recorded using digital voice recorders, after receiving permission from participants.</p><p>Ethics approval was obtained from the Institutional Review Boards at SCARF and Sangath in India and the Ethics Committees at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (approval number 5579) and King's College, London (PNM/08/09&#x02013;121) in the UK.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.4"><label>2.4</label><title>Analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were conducted using Stata 11 (<xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">Stata Corp, 2009</xref>). To test the hypothesis that higher caregiver experience of stigma was associated with higher knowledge about schizophrenia, linear regression was used to assess the association of the Caregiver Stigma Mean Score (CSMS) expressed as a continuous outcome with the Knowledge about Schizophrenia Interview (KASI) total score and each of its sub-scores, expressed as categorical variables. Given the lack of any crude correlations, no further analytic steps were carried out, and findings were interpreted with regard to the hypothesis.</p><p>Next, we aimed to identify factors independently associated with caregiver stigma. First, the CSMS was examined in relationship to socio-demographic and clinical variables in univariate analyses using linear regression. Potential predictors were then identified using an analytic diagram. Factors associated with a significant (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.1) outcome were included in the multivariable linear regression model following a hierarchical approach (<xref rid="bib60" ref-type="bibr">Victora et&#x000a0;al., 1997</xref>). After adjusting for the other factors in the model, only those factors which remained significant (p&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.1) were retained in the final model. The analysis of qualitative data used techniques of thematic analysis (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>) and was carried out during the process of data collection. Qualitative analysis software (NVivo 8 (<xref rid="bib40" ref-type="bibr">QSR International Pty Ltd., 2008</xref>)) was used for coding, as well as for higher levels of analysis.</p><p>The analytic process was collaborative and involved the authors and interviewers in all study sites. The method employed a combination of deductive and inductive principles. The list of topics covered by the interview guide was derived from a deductive framework based on a literature review, which was set aside once data collection had commenced to allow the process to be as inductive as possible. Thus, analysis did not follow a specific stigma framework but rather aimed to explore the meaning of &#x02018;stigma&#x02019; from the perspective of interviewees. First, a set of transcripts were coded independently by researchers using &#x02018;open coding&#x02019;(<xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">Green and Thorogood, 2004</xref>). The group discussed the codes and tentative categories were derived. A further six interviews were coded independently by RP and MK using the revised scheme. Coding was compared, significant differences resolved and definitions clarified.</p><p>MK then coded a representative subset of transcripts (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;24 interview pairs) while 12 interview pairs were coded by RP and SK. The scheme was continually developed as analysis progressed to incorporate new codes. A trail of coding steps was maintained.</p><p>The process of identification of themes and links in the data started during coding and involved a collaborative review of the material as well as clustering of sub-codes and codes to form categories. Relationships between subcategories and categories were examined in order to decide which categories informed the same overarching concepts. Preliminary themes were established and examined for internal homogeneity and external heterogeneity (<xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">Braun and Clarke, 2006</xref>). PLS and caregiver narratives were first analysed in parallel, in order to triangulate the study findings on PLS&#x02019; experiences of stigma from both sources (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), for example, the study would look at negative societal reactions faced by PLS, both from the perspective of their own reports and from the perspective of primary caregivers. The second phase of analysis focused on caregivers' own experiences of stigma. Preliminary categories and themes were reviewed and validated and additional themes relevant to caregiver's experiences identified.</p><p>The development of the thematic network was inductive and drew upon tentative links among categories and themes which were captured while coding using a level of inductive codes that captured statements in which these links were apparent. It was further informed by a log of analytic observations noted during coding, case summaries and analytic collaborator's meetings. A preliminary thematic network was drawn up based on an interim analysis of 24 caregiver interviews. It was then cross-checked and validated based on the full data set available (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;36). This additional step of validation did not yield any significantly different findings, but added further detail and depth to the analysis. The final thematic network presented in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref> illustrates the results of this substantially data-driven process.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="sec3.1"><label>3.1</label><title>Sample description</title><p><xref rid="tbl1" ref-type="table">Table&#x000a0;1</xref> describes characteristics of caregivers and key characteristics of PLS.

Most felt that other people should not know as they feared negative consequences for the PLS, themselves and other family members. Caregivers often felt responsible for having to manage information about the PLS&#x02019; condition in the interest of the family, and were concerned that some of the PLS&#x02019; &#x02018;behaviours and illness manifestations&#x02019;, particularly poor self-care, inappropriate dress or side effects of medication might lead to &#x02018;others finding out&#x02019; (see <italic>Arrow 1</italic>
<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). Pervasive consequences to illness disclosure were anticipated, particularly in those families that had managed to conceal it. Caregivers' concerns for the PLS were similar to those that PLS had for themselves (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>) e.g., worries that other people might look down upon the PLS, or treat them without respect.

Several positive responses were reported to active disclosure to trusted individuals.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.4.2"><title>Key theme 2: Negative reactions towards the caregiver</title><p>Caregivers' reported a complex interplay of both positive and negative reactions from others.

Sometimes, this appeared to be because they wanted to avoid the PLS rather than the caregiver per se. A few caregivers felt that they were <italic>&#x02018;treated differently&#x02019;</italic> or <italic>&#x02018;not respected&#x02019;</italic> by friends, neighbours or work colleagues (see Additional Quotes <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Online File E</xref>).</p><p>Caregivers also experienced both positive and negative reactions from other members of the family. Several faced <italic>critical comments</italic> or <italic>disagreements</italic> about how to manage the PLS&#x02019; behaviour and treatment, or tried to defend the interest of the PLS against other family members who were affected by him/her not working or getting married. Several caregivers <italic>felt alone</italic> in their caregiving role.</p><p>Most negative reactions that caregivers faced were linked to the &#x02018;<italic>PLS's behaviour and certain forms of manifestations of his or her illness&#x02019; (Arrow 4;</italic>
<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>), particularly odd, disruptive or aggressive behaviour and poor self-care (see Additional quotes <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Online File D</xref>).</p><p>Caregivers were also <italic>blamed</italic> when PLS did not meet role expectations in socially salient life areas, e.g., they were criticised for <italic>&#x02018;not discharging their duty&#x02019;</italic> as parents to get their child married, or for <italic>&#x02018;pampering&#x02019;</italic> their son and not trying hard enough to get him/her to work <italic>(Arrow 5)</italic> (see Additional Quotes <xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Online File D</xref>). In addition, caregivers' social relationships were affected by their own reduced ability to work and lowered financial status.

Some expressed their distress in moving accounts and were upset during the interviews.</p><p>Caregivers' reported emotions were dominated by an emphasis on <italic>&#x02018;worry and tension&#x02019;</italic>. For example, caregivers were concerned about the PLS&#x02019; health, wellbeing and future, particularly their marital and employment prospects, and the impact of the illness on the future of other family members. Related to this was the constant worry about <italic>&#x02018;others finding out&#x02019;</italic>. A few admitted they were scared of the PLS&#x02019; behaviour, especially physical violence.</p><p>Furthermore, caregivers expressed feelings of <italic>&#x02018;frustration and anger&#x02019;</italic> towards the PLS, often triggered by having to look after them with very little support. In addition, some revealed <italic>&#x02018;feelings of shame&#x02019;</italic> associated with the PLS&#x02019; appearance of behaviour in public, or simply having a mentally ill family member.

The PLS&#x02019; behaviour and appearance was also an important source of anger or shame reported by caregivers <italic>(Arrow 8)</italic>.

To examine whether stigma affected male and female caregivers differently, we compared the accounts of caregivers by gender. Overall, female caregivers seemed to be more closely involved in the care of the PLS, and were sometimes the only ones left in the family who were still in contact with the PLS. Even so, they were criticised by others for both the causation and persistence of the PLS&#x02019; &#x02018;problem&#x02019;, e.g. for not taking care well enough, having &#x02018; <italic>delivered a mad person&#x02019;,</italic> or bringing an ill daughter-in-law into the house. Several women reported feeling shunned and avoided by neighbours and relatives, and some were concerned about their own marital prospects as a consequence of their association with the PLS.</p><p>Male caregivers, on the other hand, appeared generally more distant to the PLS, and possibly less isolated through stigma. The societal reactions they faced had to do with losing respect due to being associated with the PLS against their will, distance from friends and relatives, or societal expectations such as arranging marriage as a &#x0201c;cure&#x0201d; for the PLS. One male caregiver openly spoke about his deep frustration and resorting to beating his ill wife in anger when she did not fulfil her duties.</p></sec><sec id="sec3.6"><title>The wider context: caregivers' understanding of the illness and society's perceptions</title><p>When asked what they saw as their ill family members' problem (or reason for getting medical help), most caregivers used <italic>descriptions of the behaviour that they saw as abnormal</italic>, such as <italic>&#x02018;roaming around&#x02019; or &#x02018;speaking loudly&#x02019;</italic> in order to define it, e.g., &#x0201c;<italic>The person who behaves below the normal person in the society [&#x02026;]</italic> (Female caregiver, mother of female PLS, Tamil Nadu.</p><p>The behaviours and symptoms that were seen to set the PLS apart from others were sometimes called <italic>&#x02018;behaving like a mad person&#x02019;</italic>.

For example, several caregivers thought that the condition might have been brought on by arguments in the family, or family members <italic>&#x02018;spoiling&#x02019;</italic> the PLS, shouting at him or not loving him enough. A few caregivers blamed themselves for the illness, e.g. by attributing it to an extra-marital affair.

Even though most PLS had been ill for several years (the median duration of illness was 6.3 years), many caregivers continued to worry about stigma and tried to hide the condition.</p><p>Qualitative interviews illustrate that for those caregivers experiencing stigma, its impact on relationships and emotional wellbeing was often very high. Particularly salient were experiences of being blamed, and critical comments and avoidance by others, which were linked to emotional distress, hopelessness and social withdrawal. Also important, and connected to worry and intrafamilial conflict, were concerns about &#x02018;others finding out&#x02019; and its impact on relationships and marital prospects of the PLS and other family members. Notably, worries about what <italic>might happen</italic> (anticipated stigma), or <italic>might be happening</italic> (e.g., others gossiping or looking down upon the family; perceived stigma) and attempts to prevent loss of status for the whole family featured more prominently than the actual experience of negative reactions &#x02013; as has been found for PLS&#x02019; experiences (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).

For example, whilst 45% stated they were uncomfortable to disclose the illness, a similar number (48%) were comfortable to speak about it. It is possible that factors such as the degree to which disclosure had already taken place (in rural settings and after years of illness possibly very high) might have influenced these findings. In addition to examining ways of reducing the negative impact of stigma onto caregivers, future research should seek to explore which factors may be protective against experiencing high stigma, and derive lessons for family interventions (<xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">Evans-Lacko et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib42" ref-type="bibr">Rusch et&#x000a0;al., 2009a</xref>, <xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr">Rusch et&#x000a0;al., 2009b</xref>). .</p></sec><sec id="sec4.2"><label>4.2</label><title>Integrated findings on factors influencing caregiver's experiences of stigma and negative reactions</title><p>Caregivers' experiences of stigma were closely linked to those of their ill family member and influenced by the same three key factors identified for the negative reactions faced by PLS: Symptoms of schizophrenia, &#x02018;others finding out&#x02019; and reduced ability to meet role expectations (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><sec id="sec4.2.1"><title>Symptoms of schizophrenia and caregiver stigma (pathway I; marked green in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>)</title><p>Both in quantitative and qualitative data, a link was evident between the PLS&#x02019; behaviour and symptoms/illness manifestations and caregivers' experiences of stigma.

The key reason for disclosure being of such concern was that it was seen to influence both the PLS&#x02019; and other family members' marital prospects and work (<italic>Arrow 4</italic>), with negative repercussions for the family's social standing and negative social reactions (<italic>Arrow 5</italic>).

This experience of being socially devalued simply by close association with an ill relative can also be explained using the concept of &#x02018;contamination&#x02019; put forward by Goffman and taken up in later studies on family stigma (<xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">Corrigan et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">Goffmann, 1963</xref>, <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">Larson and Corrigan, 2008</xref>). However, only relatively few caregivers reported stigmatising reactions directly as a result of being associated with a relative known as a &#x0201c;mad person&#x0201d; (illness label) (Pathway II), and much more salient were fears of the negative impact of &#x02018;others knowing&#x02019; on the family's ability to meet role expectations in key areas of social salience, such as marriage and work (<italic>Arrow 2;</italic>

The cultural importance of marriage as a focal point of stigma-related concerns is also evident in the finding that worries about marital prospects emerged as the most highly endorsed item on the caregiver stigma scale (44%), and is in line with the findings of earlier studies from India (<xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">Hopper et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Raguram et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib52" ref-type="bibr">Thara and Srinivasan, 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bib63" ref-type="bibr">Weiss et&#x000a0;al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In our publication on PLS&#x02019; experiences of stigma (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), we examined a theoretical notion put forward by <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al.

Based on our findings, we postulated that &#x0201c;what matters most to the moral status of PLS in India is to be able to meet gender-specific role expectations with regards to marriage and work, and adhere to codes of conduct in terms of socially acceptable behaviour&#x0201d;(<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>) p. 157. The accounts and experiences presented in this paper suggest that the salience of marriage, work and socially acceptable behaviour also held true for family members. Caregiver accounts suggest that some caregivers may have felt the importance of achieving &#x02018;what matters most&#x02019; even more acutely than PLS, as they were trying to negotiate between an ill loved one, the family reputation and the demands of society around them.</p><p>As discussed in (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>), the religious imperative of doing one's duties in life in accordance with dharma (rooted in Hindu philosophy and influential across religious groups) and the importance of achieving work and marriage in the context of poverty and inadequate health and social care systems may have added to the salience of this domain ((<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">Loganathan and Murthy, 2011</xref>)).

Of note, many caregivers' did not see the PLS&#x02019; unusual behaviour as something that could be explained as an &#x02018;illness&#x02019;, and often assumed that the PLS were acting intentionally, an observation that has been made in other studies on stigma in LAMIC (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mathias et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Thara et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec4.3.2"><title>The relationship between knowledge about schizophrenia and caregiver stigma</title><p>Contrary to our hypothesis that caregivers with higher levels of knowledge of schizophrenia would experience less caregiver stigma, this study found no quantitative association between caregivers' knowledge and their experience of stigma (<xref rid="appsec1" ref-type="sec">Table&#x000a0;3 Online File C</xref>).</p><p>Qualitative findings, however, illustrate several ways in which caregivers' understanding of illness was linked to their experience of stigma:</p><p>One such connection relates to <italic>beliefs about the illness</italic>: Many caregivers reported that they had felt that the condition was <italic>&#x02018;incurable&#x02019;</italic> or that it brought <italic>&#x02018;dishonour&#x02019;</italic> and <italic>&#x02018;different treatment&#x02019;</italic> to those affected, which added to their distress and hopelessness, and their decisions not to tell others or seek help. Caregivers' <italic>perceptions of other people's views of the illness</italic> added to this: several felt that other people looked down upon those with the illness and their families (<italic>perceived stigma</italic>), and these negative reactions were considered &#x02018;natural&#x02019; or understandable by some caregivers. Some narratives reflect how these perceptions were linked to caregivers' sense of shame, low self-esteem, anticipated negative reactions and concerns about &#x02018;others finding out. Finally, several of the <italic>causal attributions</italic> cited by caregivers (e.g., purposeful evocation of evil spirits, volitional &#x02018;misbehaviour&#x02019; by the PLS, the PLS' personality or past sins, inadequate care by other family members, or the caregiver's own failings) implied that someone was <italic>to blame</italic> for the appearance or persistence of the problem. Similarly, <italic>being blamed by others</italic> formed an important aspect of caregivers' and PLS&#x02019; experience of stigma in this study (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>)suggesting that causal explanations attributing blame were held more widely in participants' social networks. Caregivers often faced critical comments from neighbours and other family members as a result of the PLS&#x02019; behaviour or persistent illness that implied that these could have been prevented with the right attitude or effort. At the same time, some caregivers were themselves critical of their ill family member, and what they saw as intentional &#x02018;misbehaviour&#x02019;, &#x02018;laziness&#x02019;, or &#x02018;not putting in the effort&#x02019; required to get better, as has been found in earlier studies from India (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mathias et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib41" ref-type="bibr">Raguram et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>, <xref rid="bib53" ref-type="bibr">Thara et&#x000a0;al., 2003</xref>). This was consistent with PLS&#x02019; own accounts of their experiences (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Could it be that blaming responses in our sample were linked to limited &#x02018;knowledge about schizophrenia?&#x02019; Or, more generally, to the lack of a widely accepted illness concept that would explain unusual behaviours or reduced functioning without anyone being at fault?</p><p>There is some evidence to support this hypothesis: The described tendency to attribute blame for mental illness and its symptoms to the person affected or their family has been observed in many settings, including India (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mathias et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, research from China has suggested that caregivers&#x02019; critical responses towards PLS were linked to attributions that PLS played a causal role in their own behaviour (<xref rid="bib65" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2004</xref>), consistent with attributional theory (<xref rid="bib62" ref-type="bibr">Weiner et&#x000a0;al., 1988</xref>). Whilst, to our knowledge, this has not been examined quantitatively for the Indian context, the findings of this study support the notion that criticism and negative reactions from caregivers were more common amongst caregivers who believed that the PLS had a choice about their behaviour.</p><p>Sociological research has described simultaneous positive and negative stigma-related effects of introducing illness labels to explain manifestations of mental illness (<xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">Link and Phelan, 1999</xref>), coining the term &#x02018;labelling paradox&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">Perry, 2011</xref>). In the context of this study, this paradox might have manifested in the following way: with limited caregiver knowledge, stigma appeared to be primarily directed towards socially unacceptable behaviours, rather than a (psychiatric) illness label, as evident in descriptions of abnormal behaviour being used to define the PLS&#x02019; &#x02018;problem&#x02019;. This would have reduced the likelihood of being stigmatised via an illness label (<italic>Pathway II;</italic>
<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>) and given those affected by stigma the chance to recuperate their social standing once the PLS&#x02019; abnormal behaviour was back in control (<italic>Pathway I;</italic>
<xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>). On the other hand, not being able to draw upon an illness concept that would explain abnormal behaviours without anyone being at fault, might have had negative repercussions in the form of blaming and critical comments. Supporting this, there was evidence, both in caregivers' and PLS&#x02019; qualitative narratives, that not understanding the symptoms of schizophrenia led to blaming responses. Some caregivers specifically said that learning that the PLS&#x02019; behaviours were due to an illness and not intentional helped them respond better, which had in turn improved the relationships within the family (see interview quotation above). Others reported that learning about the availability of treatment had been a huge relief and made it easier to talk to others about the condition.</p><p>Conversely, quantitative caregiver stigma scores (a conglomerate measure of caregiver stigma rather than blaming per se) were not correlated with knowledge about schizophrenia as measured by the KASI. As the KASI measures knowledge about schizophrenia according to a Western bio-medical model of mental illness, this suggests that having a better understanding of this biomedical illness model did not reduce stigma, at least not the aspects of stigma measured quantitatively. One possible reason for this might be that caregivers usually held several explanatory models and illness beliefs simultaneously, as has been found in other Indian studies (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Charles et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Das et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). That is, even if caregivers had some &#x02018;knowledge&#x02019; in the bio-medical sense and reported this on the KASI questionnaire, they may have simultaneously held other views which had more bearing on their experience of stigma. This hypothesis would be supported by the findings of an earlier trial of an educational intervention in India which demonstrated that family caregivers held multiple explanatory models simultaneously only some of which were changed by the intervention (<xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Das et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>). It is also interesting that regression analyses on the experiences of PLS unexpectedly found that PLS whose caregivers had higher levels of knowledge about schizophrenia, experienced <italic>higher</italic> levels of negative discrimination (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). That is, caregivers being more aware of the bio-medical illness model of schizophrenia did not protect them from experiencing stigma, and possibly had a negative effect on PLS&#x02019; experiences of discrimination (the nature and direction of the association remain unclear). These findings are supported by a growing body of research indicating that certain forms of knowledge, particularly information projecting a biomedical model of mental illness, may increase rather than decrease social distance from people with mental illness (<xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">Phelan et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr">Schomerus et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bib67" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2012</xref>). Overall, our findings suggest that &#x02018;knowledge about schizophrenia&#x02019; interacts with the process of stigmatisation in complex ways. They add to the existing evidence that knowledge conveying a bio-medical model of illness may not be beneficial or even harmful when seeking to reduce stigma. On the other hand, some aspects of knowledge, such as information on the nature and management of symptoms, may be helpful in terms of reducing certain types of stigmatising responses, e.g. blaming. Educational interventions need to consider carefully what messages should be conveyed in the interest of reducing stigma, taking into account context-specific illness beliefs and attributions (<xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">Charles et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>, <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">Das et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec4.4"><label>4.4</label><title>Study limitations</title><p>Despite efforts to make the study sample representative, it is limited to caregivers of PLS in psychiatric care. We have further discussed that the KASI reflects knowledge of a biomedical model of schizophrenia, and it is possible that results would have been different if a measure of illness understanding more in line with local explanatory models had been used. Language and cultural barriers, and the fact that many study collaborators were psychiatrists, may also have played a role in data analysis and interpretation. There was oversampling of dyads with higher discrimination reported by PLS in the qualitative sample, which might have increased the likelihood of more severe stigma in families being reported in the qualitative data. However, the impact on caregiver stigma findings overall is considered limited, as confirmed by a comparison of caregiver stigma scores between the total sample and the qualitative sample which revealed no significant difference (p&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;0.10). Finally, it is possible that social desirability, loyalty and the wish not to speak negatively about family members may have influenced the findings.</p></sec><sec id="sec4.5"><label>4.5</label><title>Implications</title><p>The findings of this study have implications for research, practice and stigma interventions. Our findings illustrate that the impact of stigma on the lives of some family members needs to be recognised in the planning and implementation of anti-stigma interventions and health care interventions to support PLS in India. This is important to achieve improvements for PLS, but also a relevant outcome in its own right, given the enormous economic, social and emotional impact faced by family caregivers.</p><p>Based on the findings of this study and existing research, we would recommend that such interventions adopt a systemic approach that recognises the close links between PLS&#x02019; and caregivers' experiences and caregivers double role as people experiencing, and sometimes, enacting stigma (<xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">John et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">Phillips et&#x000a0;al., 2002</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">Singh et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib58" ref-type="bibr">Trani et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Health services for PLS need to create spaces where caregivers can speak openly about their own experience of stigma and other needs (possibly using a locally adapted caregivers&#x02019; needs assessment (<xref rid="bib61" ref-type="bibr">Wancata et&#x000a0;al., 2006</xref>)). Respite help, contact with peer support groups, and opportunities to access healthcare, emotional and social support in their own right should be facilitated for caregivers where feasible and appropriate.</p><p>The data obtained from caregivers in this study support our previous recommendations that care interventions should focus on &#x02018;what matters most&#x02019; (<xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>) to people's sense of worth and social acceptance in their local context, particularly recovery-oriented work to support PLS&#x02019; taking up social roles that fulfil them and earn them respect, e.g. in marriage and work. Treatments to help PLS manage the types of illness manifestations most clearly associated with negative reactions, e.g. positive symptoms, socially unacceptable behaviour and poor self-care, may help reduce stigma-related stress for both PLS and caregivers (<xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">Koschorke et&#x000a0;al., 2014</xref>). Given many caregivers' concerns about &#x02018;others finding out&#x02019;, interventions may further offer support with disclosure decisions (<xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">Corrigan and Rao, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Further research is required to identify and test strategies to support family caregivers with their own experiences of stigma, and help them support the PLS with theirs. Future studies of stigma would further benefit from having measures available that have the power to differentiate between different stigma pathways, e.g. stigma of behaviours, stigma of illness labels and stigma of inability to meet role expectations (see also pathways I, II and II in <xref rid="fig2" ref-type="fig">Fig.&#x000a0;2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, research should ascertain which messages should be conveyed in educational interventions seeking to reduce the impact of stigma in a range of settings and target groups (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Clement et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The findings of this study suggest, for the context of India, that educational interventions to reduce stigma should emphasise: i) that PLS can recover and lead meaningful lives, including in the life domains that &#x02018;matter most&#x02019; in the local context, (<xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">Clement et&#x000a0;al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bib66" ref-type="bibr">Yang et&#x000a0;al., 2007</xref>); ii) that disruptive behaviour and other illness manifestations can be helped by the right kind of treatment and support; and iii) that such treatment and support is available (a requisite, which will first need to be met, of course). The findings indicate caution, however, with regard to interventions that concentrate on promoting bio-medical illness notions or attributions, and indicate that it may be more helpful to adopt a pragmatic approach focused on recovery and treatment. At the same time, specific messages linked to causal attributions, particularly <italic>&#x02018;no-one is to blame&#x02019;</italic> may still be effective and need to be tested in interventions research.</p><p>The complex interplay of positive and negative reactions found in most narratives suggests that research should focus not only on how to reduce stigma, but also on how to enhance social inclusion and positive reactions (<xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">Mathias et&#x000a0;al., 2015</xref>). Given the notable proportion of caregivers in this study who did not report high stigma experience, research should also examine factors determining stigma resilience and derive lessons for interventions.</p><p>Finally, anti-stigma efforts need to reach beyond healthcare interventions to achieve lasting changes in public attitudes and behaviours towards people with mental illness and their families, for example through community interventions (<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr">Sarkar and Punnoose, 2016</xref>, <xref rid="bib56" ref-type="bibr">Thornicroft et&#x000a0;al., 2016</xref>). Qualitative findings further indicate an urgent need to reduce the emotional and financial burden of caregiving and negative impact of stigma through structural changes, for example social and financial supports such as family pensions and disability benefits, and importantly, adequate and accessible healthcare for PLS and family members.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list id="cebib0010"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Attride-Stirling</surname><given-names>J.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Thematic networks: an analytic tool for qualitative research</article-title><source>Qual.
