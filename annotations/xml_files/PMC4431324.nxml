The SWEdish FarmacOTherapy (Swefot) trial is unique among available randomised controlled trials in assessing this common situation by randomly allocating early RA patients with inadequate methotrexate response to addition of a biologic or further conventional DMARDs. Another unique feature is that Swefot was a randomised trial conducted within a clinical quality register, and thereafter enriched through linkage with nationwide health registers for outcome assessment.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>As previously reported, addition of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor infliximab resulted in better treatment response at 9,<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> but not 15 or 21&#x02005;months after randomisation,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> as compared with addition of the conventional DMARDs sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine (also referred to as triple therapy).

<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> while no differences were detected in quality of life or work loss improvement.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></p><p>Over the last decade, the increasing treatment costs of RA, incurred by the introduction of biologic DMARDs,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> have led to a growing interest in economic evaluations to determine whether the increased drug costs will be offset by reduced healthcare use and productivity losses, as well as result in better quality of life. Cost-utility analyses assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, comparing the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) of alternative interventions. Studies apply a healthcare or societal perspective, the latter including medical costs and other costs to society, such as lost productivity.

The statistician who prepared the list had no further role in the study. When a patient at the 3-month visit was judged to be eligible for randomisation, the investigator contacted the central study coordinator by telephone and requested randomisation. We did not use stratification or blocking. Doctors and patients were aware of the treatment allocation (addition of two oral drugs vs one infusion).</p><p><italic>Treatment adjustments</italic>: Allowed treatment changes have been described previously.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Most importantly, in case of adverse events, sulfasalazine or hydroxychloroquine could be dose-reduced or withdrawn (while continuing the other). Alternatively, both could be replaced by cyclosporin A (2.5&#x02005;mg/kg/day; increase up to 5&#x02005;mg/kg/day allowed), while infliximab could be switched to etanercept (50&#x02005;mg subcutaneously once weekly).</p><p><italic>Follow-up</italic>: Visits were scheduled at run-in, randomisation, and 3, 6, 9, 15 and 21&#x02005;months after randomisation. Patients could discontinue the assigned treatment at any time for lack of effectiveness, side-effects, or by own choice.

The potential of the Swefot trial to detect differential effects on work loss or utility occurring early after initiation of combination therapy may have been decreased by the improvements seen already during the methotrexate run-in period.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>

Either way, the available modelling results are principally based on studies of patients with established RA, and previous exposure to at least two traditional DMARDs, TNF inhibitors added to methotrexate are often compared with continued methotrexate monotherapy, and no available cost-effectiveness analyses use triple therapy as comparator.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>
<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></p><p>Combining data from various sources to estimate cost-effectiveness over extended time horizons, modelling studies inevitably require a large number of assumptions,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and comparisons to our trial-based results are hampered by the great methodological differences. Apart from the higher drug costs of the infliximab group, our high incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was largely driven by the absence of a between-group difference in QALYs, while cost reductions were also not observed in healthcare use or productivity&#x02014;all variables that modelling studies often derive indirectly from other clinical parameters such as the HAQ score.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>The recent TEAR trial compared methotrexate plus etanercept to triple therapy in early RA, reporting similar clinical outcomes and small radiographic differences after 2&#x02005;years, whether the strategies were used as first-line treatment or following inadequate methotrexate response (as in our study).<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Likewise, similar radiographic and clinical outcomes between treatment arms were found after 5&#x02005;years of follow-up in the NEO-RACo trial, where early RA patients were randomised to receive either initial infliximab or placebo infusions in addition to combination DMARDs.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Furthermore, in patients with established RA and active disease despite methotrexate therapy, triple therapy was recently reported to be non-inferior to methotrexate plus etanercept after 48&#x02005;weeks regarding reduction of disease activity and radiographic progression.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Although no health economic analyses have been presented based on these trials, it stands to reason that the results would strongly favour conventional therapy.</p><p>While we believe our overall findings to be generalisable, the detailed cost results may not be transferable to non-Swedish settings due to the different healthcare and social insurance systems in different countries. Nonetheless, drug and healthcare costs were comparable to those of the BeSt trial, while our register-assessed productivity loss estimates were higher.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Implications</title><p>Based on the 2-year Swefot results, in early, methotrexate-refractory RA, an attempt with conventional triple therapy appears reasonable from a clinical and economic viewpoint before starting infliximab treatment. Larger studies may, however, be needed to confirm our finding.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Strengths</title><p>We addressed a central question of early RA&#x02014;whether, in the face of insufficient methotrexate response, the addition of a costly anti-TNF agent offers good value for money, as compared to adding further conventional DMARDs.</p><p>Data on healthcare use and work loss were retrieved via linkage to national registers, avoiding non-response and recall bias associated with capturing costs by questionnaires. Combined with quality of life and drug use data, this enabled a cost-effectiveness study based solely on direct observations, something not previously available for the treatments studied, and to the best of our knowledge representing the first cost-effectiveness analysis of a register-enriched randomised controlled trial.</p><p>As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013205060TB2">table 2</xref>, following protocol breach, patients in the conventional arm often received biologic therapy, thus decreasing between-group drug cost differences. To reflect reality, we analysed costs and utilities accumulated during the full 21&#x02005;months follow-up in all patients by the intention-to-treat principle, thereby comparing two treatment strategies, commencing with addition of either infliximab or further conventional DMARDs upon methotrexate failure.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Limitations</title><p>The open-label design is a limitation of the Swefot trial, as discussed previously.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Moreover, the relatively short time horizon, the limited study sample totalling 258 randomised individuals, and powering of the trial to detect a between-group difference in clinical response, and not in costs or QALYs, all entail risks of type two error. However, rather than diverging, quality of life and work loss both followed similar trajectories in the two study groups,<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>
<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> while the higher drug costs in the infliximab arm were considerable.</p><p>We did not include costs of primary care, community care and transportation, informal care, patients' out of pocket expenses, or loss of unpaid work and leisure time. In a Swedish survey from 2002, these parameters (loss of unpaid work not included) accounted for 16% of total societal costs in a cohort of patients with established RA of whom 14% used biologics.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Based on this and on the absence of a between-group difference in QALYs, potential cost differences in these items would be unlikely to change the study conclusion.</p><p>The intravenous infliximab administration may partly explain the higher healthcare use in the infliximab group. Apart from infusion logistics, the frequent visits could potentially also generate more medical interventions in general. Again, however, in the absence of a QALY difference, and with the large drug cost difference, exclusion of such preparation-driven expenses would only have minor impact on the present results.</p><p>Future potential price decreases for infliximab may be anticipated to change the cost-effectiveness outcome. In our analysis, however, even ascribing the same price to both treatment strategies would not produce incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below generally accepted willingness-to-pay levels, due to the lack of a difference in effect and the higher healthcare use in the infliximab group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="ANNRHEUMDIS2013205060TB2">table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In patients with methotrexate-refractory early RA, a treatment strategy commencing with addition of infliximab, as compared with sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine, was associated with similar effects but higher costs over 21&#x02005;months. Less radiographic progression was, however, observed with the infliximab strategy, calling for future studies to assess cost-effectiveness in the longer term.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2013-205060-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d35e1660" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are indebted to all patients, colleagues and staff who made the Swefot trial possible.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> JKE, JAK and MN had full access to all of the data in the study and take responsibility for the accuracy of the data analysis.
