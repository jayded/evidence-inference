The present study explored brain plasticity associated with two behavioral interventions, memory enhancement training (MET) and a mind-body practice (yogic meditation), in healthy seniors with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) using structural magnetic resonance imaging (s-MRI) and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS). Senior participants (age &#x02265;55 years) with MCI were randomized to the MET or yogic meditation interventions. For both interventions, participants completed either MET training or Kundalini Yoga (KY) for 60-min sessions over 12 weeks, with 12-min daily homework assignments. Gray matter volume and metabolite concentrations in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and bilateral hippocampus were measured by structural MRI and <sup>1</sup>H-MRS at baseline and after 12 weeks of training. Metabolites measured included glutamate-glutamine (Glx), choline-containing compounds (Cho, including glycerophosphocholine and phosphocholine), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and N-acetyl aspartate and N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate (NAA-NAAG). In total, 11 participants completed MET and 14 completed yogic meditation for this study. Structural MRI analysis showed an interaction between time and group in dACC, indicating a trend towards increased gray matter volume after the MET intervention. <sup>1</sup>H-MRS analysis showed an interaction between time and group in choline-containing compounds in bilateral hippocampus, induced by significant decreases after the MET intervention. Though preliminary, our results suggest that memory training induces structural and neurochemical plasticity in seniors with MCI. Further research is needed to determine whether mind-body interventions like yoga yield similar neuroplastic changes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy</kwd><kwd>structural magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>memory enhancement training</kwd><kwd>yogic meditation</kwd><kwd>dorsal anterior cingulate cortex</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn001">National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100009670</named-content></funding-source></award-group><award-group><funding-source id="cn002">Brain and Behavior Research Foundation<named-content content-type="fundref-id">10.13039/100000874</named-content></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><counts><fig-count count="2"/><table-count count="3"/><equation-count count="0"/><ref-count count="78"/><page-count count="9"/><word-count count="7400"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The global population is aging at a rate unprecedented in human history. About 98 million people will be over 65 years old by 2060 (Mather et al., <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which will be paralleled by increased age-related health issues. As a result of the expanding elderly population, cognitive decline and conversion to dementia is becoming an increasingly difficult public health challenge due to high cost of care, morbidity and mortality in patients with Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD; Alzheimer&#x02019;s <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Association, 2015</xref>) and age-related dementia (Hurd et al., <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). Both neuropsychological and neuroimaging studies have suggested that mild cognitive impairment (MCI) represents a prodromal state leading to degenerative dementias including AD (Petersen et al., <xref rid="B49" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>; Palmer et al., <xref rid="B47" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>). Therefore, providing interventions to prevent age-related cognitive decline that are cost-effective and easily accessible may prove an effective way to ensure that both patients and caregivers have better quality of life, while reducing financial burden for families and society.</p><p>To date, preventive measures against cognitive decline have mainly focused on pharmacotherapy (Karakaya et al., <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>) and physical exercise (Smith et al., <xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Behrman and Ebmeier, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). Behavioral memory training is also popular, based on the notion that cognition is plastic in older age (Acevedo and Loewenstein, <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>; Eyre et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). For example, traditional memory training interventions that teach mnemonic techniques involving verbal association and visual imagery and practical strategies have been shown to boost cognitive performance, memory, and quality of life in healthy older adults (Verhaeghen et al., <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">1992</xref>; Jean et al., <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Given the growing popularity of online &#x0201c;Brain Training&#x0201d; programs, clearer understanding of behavioral memory training programs already demonstrated to be effective in the clinic is needed.</p><p>In recent years, mind-body therapies have also been studied as potential preventive measures for MCI (Grossman et al., <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>). By simultaneously targeting multiple physiological and cognitive processes, as well as their dynamic integration, meditation may offer a more efficient alternative to other behavioral interventions. Indeed, some studies indicate that senior meditators have better memory, perceptual speed, attention and executive functioning compared with non-meditators (Prakash et al., <xref rid="B51" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), though results are mixed (Chiesa et al., <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>; Goyal et al., <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>). A combination of Kirtan Kriya (KK) meditation and Kundalini Yoga (KY), as used as an intervention in the current study, is specifically shown to affect physical and mental health outcomes (Shannahoff-Khalsa, <xref rid="B61" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Krisanaprakornkit et al., <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">2006</xref>), including older adults with memory complaints (Moss et al., <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Like other forms of mind-body practice, KY and KK have been demonstrated to benefit cognitive function, depressed mood and anxiety, sleep and coping (Black et al., <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; Lavretsky et al., <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>), including older adults with cognitive impairments (Newberg et al., <xref rid="B46" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Thus, given their effectiveness and ease of use, mind-body interventions like KY and KK may be useful tools that can be readily incorporated into future clinical practice.</p><p>Despite their promise, the neurobiological mechanisms of behavioral interventions to prevent age-related cognitive decline are not well understood. In the current study, we explored how memory enhancement training (MET) and KY + KK yoga affect brain plasticity in two areas of the brain important for memory and cognition, the bilateral hippocampus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). We used structural magnetic resonance imaging (s-MRI) to measure gray-matter volume and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (<sup>1</sup>H-MRS) to measure brain metabolites. We targeted four metabolite peaks with <sup>1</sup>H-MRS previously linked to cognitive function (Friedman et al., <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Rae et al., <xref rid="B53" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Ross and Sachdev, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Stone, <xref rid="B64" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>; Yoon et al., <xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>), specifically: gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and, Glutamate + Glutamine (Glx), which reflect levels of the major inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, respectively (Maddock and Buonocore, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Ramadan et al., <xref rid="B54" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>); glycerophosphocholine + phosphocholine (Cho), a marker of cell membrane synthesis and breakdown (Maddock and Buonocore, <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>); and N-acetyl aspartate and N-acetylaspartyl-glutamate (NAA/NAAG), which is thought to be a marker of neuronal and axonal viability and density (Ross and Sachdev, <xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, this project is the first to compare the effects of MET and KK + KY on brain structure and neurochemistry in healthy seniors with MCI. Notably, our previous study in this cohort demonstrated that improved verbal memory performance in both MET and KK + KY interventions associated with functional neuroplasticity, suggesting yoga and MET may have similar influences on brain function (Eyre et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>). Based on this and related literature indicating reduced brain volume with age and memory disorders (Salat et al., <xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Lemaitre et al., <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>), we hypothesized that the volume of dACC and bilateral hippocampus would increase after both interventions. Further, we expected that <sup>1</sup>H-MRS metabolites previously linked with aging and/or memory complaints like choline and NAA/NAAG (Pfefferbaum et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Rose et al., <xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>) might also change with our interventions. The current study provides further insight into our understanding of the neuroplastic effects of the two interventions, which may help inform future improved, personalized intervention strategies to prevent age-related memory problems and cognitive decline.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials and methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants with subjective memory complaints were recruited via advertisements from UCLA outpatient clinics and UCLA Longevity Center Program from 2014 to 2015.

In MRI analyses, we found that the MET intervention was associated with decreased choline levels in bilateral hippocampus, as well as modest, but significant increases in gray-matter volume in dACC. This is the first pilot study to evaluate structural and metabolite neuroplasticity associated with MET and yoga interventions in seniors with MCI using <sup>1</sup>H-MRS and s-MRI techniques to our knowledge. However, given our relatively small sample size and the exploratory nature of the study, future research is needed to validate these results, and to determine whether yoga can induce similar patterns of neuroplasticity as we have demonstrated previously with functional MRI (Eyre et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Implications for Increased Hippocampal Choline in Cognitive Aging</title><p><sup>1</sup>H-MRS is potentially a powerful tool, offering a non-invasive approach to measuring brain metabolites <italic>in vivo</italic>. In our data, we found that choline in bilateral hippocampus decreased after MET training in seniors with MCI. Choline is a common target in <sup>1</sup>H-MRS studies, and its peak reflects the presence of phosphorylcholine and glycerophosphoryl-choline. These choline-containing compounds play significant roles in synthesis and breakdown of lipid components of cell membranes, and as precursors for the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (Amenta and Tayebati, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2008</xref>). Choline levels measured with <sup>1</sup>H-MRS have been demonstrated to increase in the aging brain (Pfefferbaum et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Haga et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and in AD (Pfefferbaum et al., <xref rid="B50" ref-type="bibr">1999</xref>; Kantarci et al., <xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Specifically, regarding <sup>1</sup>H-MRS in the hippocampus and medial temporal cortex, studies have reported increased choline with age in humans (Angelie et al., <xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">2001</xref>) and in animal models (Katz-Brull et al., <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">2002</xref>), though results are mixed (Haga et al., <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">2009</xref>) and hippocampal choline may not be elevated in MCI when compared to healthy seniors (Tumati et al., <xref rid="B67" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>). However, studies using more sensitive and invasive techniques to measure choline are more consistent; choline and choline-containing compounds measured directly from CSF via lumbar puncture seem to be consistently elevated in AD (Elble et al., <xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">1989</xref>; Walter et al., <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">2004</xref>; Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and MCI (Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>). Thus, our results may suggest that behavioral interventions like MET can reduce age-related choline increases in the hippocampus. The mechanisms underlying these effects cannot be addressed directly with MRI; however, future studies will be better able to determine, for example, whether these changes in choline-containing compounds relate to membrane turnover, acetylcholine synthesis, or other factors (Ib&#x000e1;&#x000f1;ez et al., <xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>).</p><p>Medial temporal lobe structures like the hippocampus are critical brain regions involved in memory (Tulving and Markowitsch, <xref rid="B66" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>). Hippocampal volume is often linked to performance on memory tasks (Schultz et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and has also been consistently demonstrated to change with memory training and intervention (Erickson et al., <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">2011</xref>). Hippocampal volume is also known to decrease with age and in association with MCI, AD and other age-related disorders (Lupien et al., <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">1998</xref>; Elcombe et al., <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). Given that choline-containing compounds measured with <sup>1</sup>H-MRS are associated with cell-membrane turnover, one might expect corresponding structural changes in the hippocampus as well; however, we did not find a link between hippocampal volume and memory training in the current study. This could be due to our relatively small sample, relatively short training time, and/or other aspects of our methodological approach. For example, some studies have indicated that structural plasticity in the hippocampus might vary across hippocampal subfields in relation to memory interventions (Engvig et al., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>) and AD status (Mueller et al., <xref rid="B44" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Clearly, more work is needed to determine the relationship between structural plasticity in the hippocampus and behavioral interventions for age-related memory complaints.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Role of Anterior Cingulate Cortex in Cognitive Aging</title><p>In our study, we provide novel evidence that a behavioral memory intervention (MET) can modestly increase cortical gray matter in dACC, a region of the brain linked to multiple key cognitive functions, such as error detection (Gehring et al., <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">1993</xref>), and executive processing (Carter et al., <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">2000</xref>). Gray-matter volume has been demonstrated to decrease with age in the ACC in both cross-sectional (Sowell et al., <xref rid="B63" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>) and longitudinal studies (Resnick et al., <xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">2003</xref>). Correspondingly, age is negatively correlated with blood flow in dorsal and rostral ACC regions (Vaidya et al., <xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">2007</xref>). Seniors who engage more in cognitive games and puzzles in their daily lives also tend to have greater ACC gray matter volume (Schultz et al., <xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), which is consistent with our results and raises the possibility that engaging in cognitive-behavioral games or training could prevent age-related structural atrophy in this region. Indeed, a recent study indicated a trend towards increased rostral ACC thickness in seniors after MET; however, this effect did not survive a stringent validation analysis (Engvig et al., <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>). Although our effects are modest, they do indicate that participating in effective behavioral interventions may help to ameliorate age-related brain changes associated with poor memory and cognitive performance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Yoga and the Aging Brain</title><p>Structural plasticity in the dACC and hippocampus has also been associated with yoga practice in previous studies; however, we did not find evidence of gray-matter volume changes in dACC or hippocampus after our 12-week yoga intervention. Yoga has been linked to anatomical changes in frontal cortex (Baijal and Srinivasan, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">2010</xref>; Froeliger et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Villemure et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Desai et al., <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insula (Nakata et al., <xref rid="B45" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>; Villemure et al., <xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>, <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>), and the hippocampus (Froeliger et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; Villemure et al., <xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">2015</xref>). However, many of these studies compare the brains of practiced yogis with several months or years of experience to yoga-naive controls (Froeliger et al., <xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>); perhaps the relatively shorter length of training in the current study (12 weeks) was less conducive to detecting structural plasticity associated with our yoga intervention. In this same cohort, we have already demonstrated that memory improvements after yoga and MET may induce functional plasticity in similar brain regions (Eyre et al., <xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>As with all research, there are limitations one should consider when interpreting the results of the current study. Our relatively small sample size and short duration of yogic meditation and memory trainings may have compromised our power to detect significant effects. This may have also played a role in our finding indicating that the yoga and MET groups differed in hippocampal choline at baseline; incidental findings like these are a challenge accompanying pilot studies like ours. Future studies (Flak et al., <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">2014</xref>) with larger sample sizes will provide critical independent validation of our results. However, despite these limitations we did detect two significant and potentially biologically meaningful effects, which may be generalizable to a broad population of seniors with MCI given that both intervention groups were matched for demographic features. The current study did not include a placebo or period without an intervention as a control condition, or a group of healthy seniors without MCI, which means that we are unable to directly compare our findings with neuroplasticity that might occur with typical aging similar time windows (i.e., 12 weeks). We also targeted structural and metabolite changes using <sup>1</sup>H-MRS and s-MRI; future studies integrating across more and different MRI modalities may be better able to examine different aspects of brain plasticity occurring after behavioral interventions like yoga and MET. Notably, GABA, which has a relatively low concentration in the brain, was only sampled in the dACC given that the voxel size for the hippocampus was considered too small to achieve the required SNR. In spite of these possible limitations, this study is a promising start to elucidating the brain mechanisms of behavioral interventions for seniors with MCI.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="s4-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The present study examined changes in brain metabolites and structure among individuals undergoing memory training and yogic meditation. We demonstrated that memory training over 3 months is associated with decreased choline levels in bilateral hippocampus and increased gray-matter volume in dACC, suggesting that behavioral interventions like MET may ameliorate markers of brain aging. These effects are somewhat modest, and would benefit from independent validation in larger samples and perhaps over longer-duration interventions. However, these findings suggest that engaging in cognitive activities and mind-body practices may affect the brain in positive ways, and may be combined as part of a multi-faceted approach to encourage healthy aging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Author Contributions</title><p>HL, KLN, DSK, LE and PS designed the research; HY, NMSC and HL performed the research; HY, AML and PS analyzed the data; and HY, AML, PS, PP, HAE, KLN and HL wrote the article.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was supported by the Alzheimer&#x02019;s Research and Prevention Foundation (ARPF), and 2014 National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression (NARSAD) Young Investigator Grant from the Brain and Behavior Research Foundation (22325).</p></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Conflict of Interest Statement</title><p>The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.
