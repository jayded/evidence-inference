In this randomized, Phase III trial, 137 patients with operable primary breast cancer (T2-0, N0-1) who were tested axillary LN positive through aspiration biopsy of axillary LNs were randomized (1:1) to four 3-weekly cycles of XEC or FEC. Patients underwent surgery within 4&#x02013;6 weeks after the fourth cycle, followed by four adjuvant cycles of 3-weekly XT or T. The primary end point was tumor pathological complete response. Toxicity profiles were secondary objectives. In total, 131 patients had clinical and radiological evaluation of response and underwent surgery. Treatment with XEC led to an increased rate of pathological complete response in primary tumor (18% vs 6%, respectively, <italic>P</italic>=0.027) and objective remission rate (87% vs 73%, <italic>P</italic>=0.048) compared to FEC. Clinical complete response occurred in 20% and 7% for XEC and FEC, respectively. Compared to FEC, XEC was associated with more hand-foot syndrome (57% vs 11%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and 3/4 grade nausea/vomiting/diarrhea (30% vs 14%, <italic>P</italic>=0.034) but less phlebitis (3% vs 14%, <italic>P</italic>=0.035). XT and T adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were well tolerated: treatment-related 3/4 grade adverse events occurred in 28% and 17% of patients receiving XT and T, respectively.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>breast cancer</kwd><kwd>capecitabine</kwd><kwd>docetaxel</kwd><kwd>neoadjuvant chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>curative effect</kwd><kwd>toxic side effects</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Breast cancer is a type of most commonly highly metastatic malignant tumor among females.<xref rid="b1-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was first used as induced chemotherapy or primary chemotherapy to treat locally advanced and inoperable breast cancer.

Patients were randomized to one of two treatment arms: capecitabine (Xeloda<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Shanghai Roche Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Shanghai, People&#x02019;s Republic of China) 1,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice daily on days 1&#x02013;14, plus epirubicin (Pfizer, Inc., New York, NY, USA) 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> infusion on day 1, plus cyclophosphamide (Endoxan<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>; Baxter Oncology GmbH, Halle, Germany) 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks for four cycles, or 5-FU (Shanghai Xudong Haipu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd., Shanghai, People&#x02019;s Republic of China) 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> infusion on day 1, plus epirubicin 100 mg/m<sup>2</sup> infusion on day 1, plus cyclophosphamide 500 mg/m<sup>2</sup> infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks for four cycles before surgery. The first assessment of curative effect was performed within 24&#x02013;48 hours before the third cycle of chemotherapy when the second cycle was over, and the second assessment was performed within 24&#x02013;48 hours after the fourth cycle. If the evaluation was considered invalid, then the patients were categorized as invalid group and the others underwent surgery after the fourth cycle of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and then crossed over to receive the other treatment regimens as adjuvant therapy. In the XEC arm, four-cycle adjuvant chemotherapy of XT was given: capecitabine 1,000 mg/m<sup>2</sup> orally twice daily on days 1&#x02013;14, plus docetaxel (Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co.

In the FEC arm, four-cycle adjuvant chemotherapy of T was given: docetaxel 75 mg/m<sup>2</sup> infusion on day 1 every 3 weeks. All patients positive for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were not using trastuzumab while receiving adjuvant chemotherapy because it might increase the cardiac toxicity of chemotherapy drugs. Upon completion of the adjuvant chemotherapy, all patients received radiotherapy and were concurrently treated with tamoxifen or letrozole when hormone receptor (HR) was positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Eligibility criteria</title><p>To be included in the study, patients should have biopsy-proven, newly diagnosed stage II/III, and operable breast cancer with axillary LN involved. Operable breast cancer was defined as a tumor with a diameter of &#x0003e;1 cm diagnosed by ultrasonography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The axillary LN positivity was determined by fine-needle aspiration cytology of axillary LN. Further, the eligibility criteria included patients aged 18&#x02013;70 years, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &#x02264;1 and adequate hematologic (absolute neutrophil count &#x02265;1,500/mm<sup>3</sup>, platelet count &#x02265;10,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, hemoglobin &#x02265;10 g/dL), renal (serum creatinine &#x02264;1.5 mg/dL), cardiac (confirmed by normal or nonspecific ECG or multigated acquisition scan taken within 1 month of enrollment), and hepatic (total bilirubin &#x02264;1.5 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase &#x02264;2.5&#x000d7; upper normal limit) functions.

It not only narrows the primary lesion and regional LNs, degrades clinical staging, increases the chances in patients who could not be operated before, and improves the resection rate and the breast conserving rate but also controls subclinical lesions effectively, reduces tumor loading, and improves the prognosis. Furthermore, it could reduce the chances of distant metastasis by destroying distantly potential micrometastasis and provide evidence for sequential treatment through judging the sensitivity of tumors to chemotherapy.<xref rid="b18-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b19-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Currently, neoadjuvant chemotherapy has become a standard treatment for invasive breast cancer in stage II/III, but there is no unified standard in the specific treatment including cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/5-FU, 5-FU/adriamycin/cyclophosphamide, FEC, and docetaxel/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide.<xref rid="b20-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></p><p>Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has provided an opportunity for studying the biological effects of systemic treatment in breast cancer and can be used to choose effective index for predicting the prognosis in clinical settings. Early systemic chemotherapy can induce apoptosis of tumor cells and reduce the metastasis rate in surgery.<xref rid="b22-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> The pathological response in the primary tumor after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is closely related to prognosis. Patients with pCR have an 86% 5-year survival rate and achieve an obvious survival benefit. Therefore, we can evaluate the effect of chemotherapy through pathological response condition of the primary tumor and predict the prognosis.<xref rid="b18-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="b20-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b23-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Patients who responded well to neoadjuvant chemotherapy especially those with pCR, have a significantly improved disease-free survival rate.<xref rid="b25-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Capecitabine, as an antimetabolite, is a new-generation oral derivative of FU. After ingestion, it is rapidly nearly completely absorbed as an active compound in the gastrointestinal tract and is converted into 5-FU via a three-step enzymatic pathway.<xref rid="b26-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b27-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> After two intermediate steps involving carboxylesterase in the liver and cytidine deaminase in the liver and/or tumor tissue, the final metabolite is converted into 5-FU by thymidine phosphorylase. Thymidine phosphorylase as the last enzyme in the activation of capecitabine has a higher concentration in malignant cells compared to healthy tissue, especially in breast cancer and gastric carcinoma causing DNA dyssynthesis in cancer tissue to achieve an antitumor effect, thus having selective and targeted anti-tumor effect.<xref rid="b28-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Therefore, cancer tissue can convert more capecitabine into 5-FU, with less concentration in healthy tissue, so that 5-FU does not injure the healthy tissue and has less toxic and side effects. In conclusion, capecitabine is an oral chemotherapy drug with less toxicity and has a unique advantage in the treatment of breast cancer.</p><p>Patients with stage II/III breast cancer were treated prior to surgery by neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including treatment regimens XEC and FEC where both were compared for efficacy and adverse events in this study. It was concluded from the results that compared to the FEC arm, XEC significantly increased both the tumor pCR rate (18% vs 6%, <italic>P</italic>=0.027) and the clinical response rate (87% vs 73%, <italic>P</italic>=0.048). A large-scale, multiple-center clinical research reported that patients with primary or metastatic breast cancer who could not be treated with anthracycline- and/or taxol-containing regimens can be treated with capecitabine. The effective rate of single-drug first-line treatment was found to be 15%&#x02013;37%, and the median progression-free survival was from 3 to 5 months.<xref rid="b29-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> In the study by Kamal et al,<xref rid="b30-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> 257 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with capecitabine or taxol. The results showed that the overall survival rate and tumor specificity in patients treated with capecitabine or taxol were similar, and there was no significant difference in the survival benefit. In addition, the results from a multiple-center, randomized Phase III clinical trial showed that the effect of capecitabine was as good as the combination of vinorelbine plus gemcitabine, when compared between these drugs in patients who were treated ineffectively with anthracycline- and/or taxol-containing regimens.<xref rid="b31-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> Therefore, capecitabine played an important role in both single drug and combination therapy. Capecitabine monotherapy or capecitabine-containing regimens can be used not only as first-line treatment in advanced breast cancer but also as second- or third-line treatment in locally advanced breast cancer due to its good tolerance to side effects.<xref rid="b32-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b35-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> After success with combination therapy, sequential treatment until single-drug maintenance could prolong the survival time in advanced breast cancer patients.</p><p>One research<xref rid="b36-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> showed that TNBC was more sensitive to capecitabine and could achieve better pCR and cCR as neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared to non-TNBC. Other studies<xref rid="b37-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="b38-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> suggested that HR-positive tumors show resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and were difficult to achieve pCR. In this study, the fact that 92% of TNBC achieved ORR in XEC while only 73% in FEC implied that treatment with XEC would have better curative effect to TNBC than FEC. Since there was no statistically significant difference, the result may change if the number of subjects was increased. In addition, XEC achieved more tumor pCR (ten patients, 83%) compared with FEC (two patients, 22%) in TNBC (<italic>P</italic>=0.009; interaction <italic>P</italic>=0.028). At the same time, XEC had a trend toward increased pCR in patients with HR negative and HER2 negative/unknown. Similarly, due to small sample, the result may change after increasing the number of subjects, although there was no statistically significant difference.</p><p>In addition to superior efficacy, the tolerability of XEC was also compared to that of FEC. From the comparison of adverse events, the incidence rate of HFS in the XEC arm was higher (57% vs 11%, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) compared to the FEC arm. Several studies showed that the incidence rate of HFS in capecitabine-containing chemotherapy regimens was higher because of the characteristics of the drug, which was consistent with the results in this study.<xref rid="b39-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="b40-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Severe HFS may lead to reduction in drug dosage; therefore, it is important to prevent and reduce the incidence rate and degree of this syndrome, and it is known that vitamin B6 can relieve the symptom of HFS caused by 5-FU. In this study, it is reported that oral capecitabine with a large dose of vitamin B6 (300 mg/d) can reduce the incidence rate and symptom of HFS. In addition, a retrospective study suggested that cyclooxygenase-specific inhibitor might have the same effect as the combination of capecitabine and vitamin B6, as well.<xref rid="b41-ott-9-3443" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> There were more patients with 3/4 grade nausea/vomiting/diarrhea in the XEC arm than in the FEC arm (30% vs 14%; <italic>P</italic>=0.034), because capecitabine was absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract and needs to be taken orally for 2 weeks.</p><p>The side effects such as phlebitis, arthralgia/myalgia, alopecia, leukopenia, and 3/4 grade mucositis were lower in XEC than in FEC. Among them, there was a statistically significant difference in phlebitis. XT and T adjuvant chemotherapy regimens were well tolerated: treatment-related 3/4 grade adverse events occurred in 28% and 17% of patients receiving XT and T, without statistical significance, respectively. This indicated that the XEC followed by XT regimen can be safely implemented because of less side effects and toxicity.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study showed that the XEC regimen was effective and had similar curative effect compared to the FEC regimen. Due to its good tolerability and low incidence and severity of preventable adverse events, XEC regimen should be promoted and implemented in clinical practice.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref
