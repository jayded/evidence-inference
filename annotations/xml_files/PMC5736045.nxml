Several factors contribute to a higher risk of mistakes than in other hospital departments: different team compositions from day to day, complex surgery, high-risk medication, time pressure, high patient turnover and need for rapid intervention in the case of emergency surgery. High incidence of adverse events (2.9%&#x02013;3.7% of hospitalisations) leads to high costs, patient harm and loss of trust in healthcare.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> In Dutch hospitals, 7.1% of all admitted patients experience an adverse event, of which 54.8% is related to surgery and 24.3% is related to medication.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>
</p><p>Technical and medical problems are not the main contributing factors to adverse events, but rather, problems in communication or insufficient team work are leading to errors in healthcare.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 4</xref> Therefore, check lists (eg, time-out and sign-out check lists) were introduced to operating theatres worldwide to prevent wrong-site surgery (time&#x000a0;out), to document procedures, to count used materials and verify postprocedure orders (sign&#x000a0;out).<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> The use of these check lists has led to a 47% reduction in mortality&#x000a0;and 36% reduction in morbidity,<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and mortality rates fell 62% when the check lists were used for emergency procedures.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> However, the effectiveness of safety check lists is debatable: to what extent the check&#x000a0;lists improve the clinical outcomes<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> depends on the implementation and usage of the check lists and safety attitudes of the team members.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9 10</xref> Low compliance with safety check&#x000a0;lists is reported.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> Despite a successful implementation of check lists in our hospital,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> a hierarchical system remains in the operating room: we perceived that, if not everyone is familiar with each other&#x02019;s name and function, then communication and speaking up about problems is hampered. This situation of miscommunication is a potential threat to patient safety because problems can easily go unnoticed to the whole team. Therefore, we introduced perioperative briefings and debriefings in our hospital to attempt to break through this hierarchy and create a working environment where information is shared readily and barriers to speaking up are lowered. The perioperative briefing and debriefing are additional to the time-out and sign-out procedures to improve functioning of surgical teams. Time out and sign out have become universal whole-surgery-team efforts (respectively immediately before anaesthesia induction and after surgery) to reduce the risk of adverse events.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 14</xref> Our briefings and debriefings, however, are done before and after the end of the day&#x02019;s list in the operating room in a standardised way, targeting towards work efficiency, cooperation and team functioning. One of the most important characteristics of a well-functioning team, especially when comprising professionals from diverse backgrounds such as surgical teams, is their team climate. Research has shown that team climate is positively related to providing high-quality care.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 16</xref> A briefing&#x02013;debriefing process in the operating theatre may promote patient safety by adding continuous improvement through reflective learning and immediate feedback<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> and an improved efficiency in running an ideal operating list.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Working with perioperative briefings and debriefings can also have a positive effect on collaboration and communication, which may be strengthened in combination with team training.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> However, we focus in this study on introducing perioperative briefings and debriefings. We hypothesised that improvement in team climate of surgical teams would contribute to improved patient safety in the operating theatre. Our study aim is to evaluate changes in the team climate of surgical teams, associated with the introduction of the perioperative briefings and debriefing in the operating theatres, and the experiences of the members of the surgical teams with the perioperative briefing and debriefing regarding work efficiency and cooperation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design, population and measurements</title><p>Our study was a prospective before and after intervention study with the perioperative briefing and debriefing as the intervention in the operating theatre (for definitions and aims, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>). We measured the before and after change in team climate of five surgical teams of a tertiary care hospital with 875 beds in the Netherlands. The five surgical teams representing seven surgical specialties were: general surgery; orthopaedic surgery; gynaecological surgery; neurosurgery/plastic surgery; ear-nose-throat surgery/mouth-jaw-facial surgery. Per day, the surgical team is mainly a fixed team; however, assistance of an external surgical assistant or anaesthetic nurse is common, caused by shortage of personnel. Also during the year, there is a considerable change in personnel especially of the number of surgeons, anaesthesiologists and nurses in training due to their education.</p><table-wrap id="T1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The definitions and aims of perioperative briefing and debriefing</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Intervention</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Description</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Aims related to work efficiency and team functioning</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Perioperative briefing</td><td valign="top" align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Briefing is carried out before the first patient arrives in the operating theatre.

The TCI evaluates four climate factors: &#x02018;participative safety&#x02019;, &#x02018;support for innovation&#x02019;, &#x02018;vision&#x02019; and &#x02018;task orientation&#x02019;. These factors are essential for successfully implementing innovations such as the perioperative briefing and debriefing. We also evaluated the experiences of the members of the surgical teams by using a standardised questionnaire, which was specifically designed to measure both the perioperative briefing and debriefing separately. A 5-point Likert response scale was used ranging from 1 being &#x02018;disagree strongly&#x02019; to 5 representing &#x02018;agree strongly&#x02019; with statements about work efficiency and cooperation. Additionally, participants could report perceived strengths and limitations of the briefing and debriefing. Before using this questionnaire, a small pilot study was carried out to test the feasibility and face validity and did not result in any updates. Both questionnaires were distributed by email to all team members of the surgical teams (surgeons, surgeon residents, fellow surgeons, anaesthesiologists, anaesthesiology residents, surgical assistants and anaesthetic nurses) who worked at least four times during the implementation period of the perioperative briefing and debriefing. We considered the cut-off point of four times as an acceptable exposure of the intervention. The TCI was distributed 1&#x02009;month before and (together with the evaluation questionnaire) 4 months after the implementation of the perioperative briefing and debriefing. Additionally, we sent both questionnaires 2.5 years later to measure long-term effects of the perioperative briefing and debriefing. Finally, an independent observer (medical student) measured the time in minutes of the perioperative briefings to evaluate their impact on the operating room start times.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Implementation of the perioperative briefing and debriefing</title><p>The perioperative briefing and debriefing were step-wedge implemented in the period from July 2012 to January 2014. A dedicated anaesthesiologist carried out the implementation during 4 months per surgical team by training on the job. A &#x02018;briefing card&#x02019; with topics about the personnel, operating programme and patients was used to structure and standardise the perioperative briefing and debriefing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1</xref>). Before rolling out the perioperative briefing and debriefing, we evaluated this intervention after the implementation within the first surgical team and made small changes on the briefing card.

If this model provided no fit of the data, we omitted the random effect for teams. A p value of &#x02264;0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. The experiences of surgical team members were assessed by using descriptive statistics.

Team members felt safer about sharing their observations and opinions with the rest of the team. Also, working as a team to reach a learning objective (higher goal) was appreciated as a positive stimulus; however, this appreciation decreased 10% 2.5 years after the implementation. We found that the team members perceived that especially the debriefing was insufficient. Debriefing is an essential part of the intervention because, in the debriefings, problems and interventions for improvement are discussed. Renewed attention for the importance of the performance of the debriefing might lead to better teamwork.</p><p>An important issue that can make staff reluctant to engage in briefings and debriefings is the assumption that they consume much time and delay surgical programmes. Our observations showed that the briefing is carried out in less than 4&#x02009;min and leads to a perceived higher efficiency of the surgical programme with more surgeries starting on time and less cancellations. Other studies confirm that a preoperative briefing can be carried out in less than 2&#x02009;min and objectively does not delay surgery starting times.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>
</p><p>Our results correspond with previous studies evaluating the effect of perioperative briefings and debriefings: Papaspyros <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> reported the fact that both interventions help with communication between all members of surgical teams and that people are willing to speak up when they are not happy with something. Ahmed <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> have shown that the introduction of a brief&#x02013;debrief system, as part of a module-based theatre improvement programme,<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> leads to improvements in efficiency measures such as start/overrun times. Bartz-Kurycki <italic>et al</italic>
<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> found also that the fact that debriefings in the operating room were not fully executed related to a lack of institutional awareness of its potential benefits. Despite this, debriefing is emphasised as a powerful tool to identify lessons learnt shortly after a procedure with the aim to improve future performance on an individual and team level.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26 27</xref>
</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>To our knowledge, no other changes or implementations were made during the intervention period that could have interfered with the team climate in the operating room. Also, the composition of the surgical teams was highly variable. Therefore, the improvement in team climate was not a result of the fact that team members had the opportunity to work together frequently during the intervention period. The results mainly reflect the effect of the perioperative briefings and debriefings on the team climate. We also measured the team climate and experiences of the members of the surgical teams 2.5 years after the implementation of perioperative briefing and debriefing within the last surgical team. Therefore, we can demonstrate long-term effects of perioperative briefing and debriefing. We evaluated the perioperative briefing and debriefing after implementation in one surgical team before rolling out this intervention to other teams and tested the evaluation questionnaire before using it to guarantee a successful implementation and measurement of the experiences.</p><p>Our study had some limitations. We used a before&#x02013;after study design without a control group. We did not randomise to deal with possible unknown confounders that also could have had an influence on the association of perioperative briefing and debriefing and the team climate within surgical teams. The response rate in our study was low: 17.7%&#x02013;28.6%. However, response rates below 20% are not uncommon.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28 29</xref> We included all the team members who worked in the operating room at least four times during the implementation period. This decision led to a high number of people who could have filled out the questionnaire. However, this potential number of participants may have been falsely high, leading to a low response rate. This low response rate and the fact that probably only the positive-minded team members responded create the risk that our results do not represent all the staff working in the operating room. We did not have objective observations to confirm the efficiency of perioperative briefing and debriefing, for example, drop-out of operations at the end of the day. Neither did we measure patient safety outcomes, such as adverse events related to the surgery, to confirm the effect of the improved team climate on patient safety. The Safety Attitude Questionnaire is a proper tool to measure and assess patient safety culture in an operating theatre.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> We preferred the TCI in our study because the TCI can both be used as an outcome measure of the quality-improvement intervention and the perioperative briefing and debriefing and it can predict the success or failure of this intervention.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The TCI also identifies team climate areas that could be improved and lead more directly to better healthcare and healthcare outcomes than in case of changing the patient safety attitudes of members of surgical teams. More studies with a randomised clinical trial design in hospitals where the composition of surgical teams varies daily are required to show that perioperative briefing and debriefing actually improve patient safety by affecting teamwork of surgical teams.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We hypothesised that the briefing and debriefing are probably most effective in tertiary care hospitals where teams differ every day. Smaller community hospitals generally have less alternating team compositions and may therefore benefit less from the implementation.</p><p>Our results show significant improvement of the team climate after implementation of the perioperative briefing and debriefing. The time investment for these interventions appears to be acceptable, lasting less than 4&#x02009;min. We recommend hospitals working with alternating surgical team compositions to implement the briefing and debriefing. When implementing the intervention, registration of actual starting times and cancellation of surgeries before and after the implementation should provide even more evidence for the efficiency. Perioperative briefings and debriefing lead to improved efficiency and, most importantly, improved team climate of surgical teams and have therefore positive influence on patient safety in the operating theatre.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material id="d35e180" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018367.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d35e181" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2017-018367.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank Maartje Frijlink (anaesthesiologist) for her contribution to the first version of this manuscript.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KBMSLL and MH-S led the writing of the first draft and revised this manuscript.
