In the first step, four high schools were identified through random clustering sampling, and then, one class was selected randomly from each school. The methodology was Solomon's four-group plan with 8-month follow-up period. The participants were first randomly divided into four groups; two groups were considered for intervention and two groups for control. The pretest was held in one of the intervention and control groups then two groups of intervention received necessary training, and the four groups were tested at the end meanwhile; conducted interventions were either as general or awareness of physical and psychological outcomes of cigarette smoking separately. To assess the information retention, the follow-up period was done for both groups of intervention after 8 months of posttest [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Research intervention model diagram</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEHP-6-99-g001"/></table-wrap><p>The type of intervention included photo and film from the outcomes of cigarette smoking with a short written description that was performed through group discussion and face-to-face training in four sessions during 8 h. The content of training was about physical and psychological outcomes of cigarette smoking. Assessment tool included researcher-made questionnaire and knowledge measurement that were used in the stages of pretest, posttest, and follow-up depending on the type of group to collect data.</p><p>Data were analyzed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corporation, USA. Descriptive methods were used for estimates of frequency in groups. One-way and two-way ANOVA was used for comparison of frequencies; in the final step, to pair, correlation test was used to follow up analysis.

The main &#x000b1; standard deviation of the age of participants was 15 &#x000b1; 1.15. The comparison of pretest results showed that there was no significant difference between the mean of scores generally (<italic>P</italic> = 0.813), in pretest of physical outcomes of cigarette smoking awareness (<italic>P</italic> = 0.830) and psychological outcomes of cigarette smoking awareness (<italic>P</italic> = 0.400) [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T2" position="float"><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Comparison of the results in pretest scores in the intervention and control groups</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JEHP-6-99-g002"/></table-wrap><p>The comparison of posttest results has been shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>.

Furthermore, they found educational interventions as a preventer factor of cigarette smoking.[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] However, the current study not only aimed to identify the physical and psychological outcomes of cigarette smoking but also has included an education intervention through an authentic research practice. In addition to evaluating the rate of physical and psychological outcomes of cigarette smoking awareness, the current study aims to investigate the effect of training intervention in long-term period.</p><p>Our result was showed a positive effect of training intervention on the rate of students&#x02019; awareness of cigarette smoking that is consistent with former studies. Similar researches on students have been shown that education intervention led to improving the attitude toward drug abuse dangers.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In another study, in 2007, the mean of cigarette predictive behaviors&#x02019; scores after education was increased significantly in the intervention group.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] A research by Obeidat versus Botvin has shown that there is a direct relationship between tending to smoking and also they reported that awareness, attitudes, and perception of legality and social acceptance of drug were damaged caused by pleasant consequences of drug using.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</p><p>One of the important strengths of this study was studying the physical and psychological outcomes of cigarette smoking separately, and the results confirmed that the mean of awareness scores in pretest and posttest was significantly different. The results of similar study in Tehran showed that only 28% of boys and 30.8% of girls are aware of cigarette smoking outcomes.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] Xu <italic>et al</italic>. concluded that only 19.8% of students had good awareness and 46.6% of them had good attitude toward cigarette.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In addition, the negative attitude in nonsmoker was also significantly more than smokers (48.1% and 10.6%, respectively).[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Education plan through group discussion was evaluated and results showed an increasing in awareness, attitude, and performance of students toward cigarette as well as blood factors of hemoglobin, hematocrit, and red blood cell count in the intervention group.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>The results of the current study showed that, after training intervention, the rate of psychological outcomes awareness was significantly increased. What's more, suicide is more likely to happen among smokers. The risk of suicidal tendencies among the smokers with &#x0003c;25 cigarettes per day is double compared to general population. In the cases of cigarette giving up, depression decreases between 3 weeks and 3 months and noticeable decline can be seen.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] The effects of educational plan to giving up cigarette smoking have been shown that 51.1% of smokers had succeeded to give up cigarette only based on education and behavioral therapy without using alternative drugs such as nicotine.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The second aim of the current study was evaluating training durability in the intervention group after 8 months. Interestingly, the results did not show a significant difference in the mean of scores in the intervention groups after 8 months. Therefore, obtained information in the intervention groups were retained after 8 months. The rate of retention was also more in psychological outcomes than physical ones. One reason for more retention of psychological outcomes may relate to overt contrast in society beliefs that consider cigarette as a relaxing tool.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current study showed the positive effect of training intervention on increasing teenager's awareness of cigarette outcomes, and therefore, awareness can be used as an important predictive factor for teenager's tendency to cigarette smoking. The results of follow-up also showed that training interventions have long-term effects which may help the teenagers to pass adolescence transitional phase healthily.</p><sec
