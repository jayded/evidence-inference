Despite knowing, that tourniquet induces ischemia and soft tissue damage surgeons still uses it, often not aware of the effects of the induced ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>The kinetics of ischemic metabolites during periods of ischemia and reperfusion remains uncertain. The tourniquet pressure combined with ischemia has been investigated and inflicts a more profound damage to the skeletal muscle than ischemia alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The clinical aspects regarding tourniquet use has been vigorously investigated and cases of rhabdomyolysis have been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The skeletal muscle in limbs is very sensitive to ischemic changes and a clinical assessment is not sufficient to evaluate the degree of ischemic tissue damage induced by the tourniquet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Thus, using an in vivo technique could provide a more accurate assessment of the metabolic events.</p><p>Microdialysis (MD) is a minimally invasive technique that allows continuous in vivo monitoring of metabolism in extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. It was originally described by Ungersted and Pycock to monitor neurochemical changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Interstitial levels of metabolites as glucose, lactate, pyruvate, lactate/pyruvate (L/P) ratio were measured, because they serve as direct indicators of ischemia, whereas glycerol reflects cell damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. During ischemia, lactate increases and pyruvate decreases, leading to an increased L/P ratio, where a ratio above 25 is considered abnormal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Lactate/pyruvate ratio was calculated since it is a precise marker of ischemia and increase during ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>The microdialysis catheter consists of a double-lumen linear tube that at the tip has a semipermeable membrane, the tube mimics the functions of a capillary blood vessel. The catheter is connected to a pump that, with a constant flow, pumps the fluid so it can pass the membrane. Diffusion along the concentration gradient occurs in the interstitial space and equilibrium takes place between the fluid and molecules. The molecules are collected in small vials, which reflects the composition of the interstitial space fluid and can then be analyzed immediately afterwards. The metabolites of interests have traditionally been pyruvate, glucose, lactate and glycerol.</p><p>To our knowledge MD technique has not been applied in a randomized controlled setup to investigate tourniquet induced ischemia during TKA surgery, even though this could contribute to the understanding of the phenomenon.</p><p>The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo degree of ischemia in skeletal muscle with the use of MD during surgery and cuff inflation and during a period of reperfusion to estimate ischemia and cell damage. In particular the limb distally to the cuff was of particular interest and not directly beneath the cuff, where apparent ischemia takes place.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized clinical trial was conducted at Aalborg University Hospital, Aalborg, Denmark.

The skeletal muscle must change from oxidative phosphorylation to anaerobic glycolysis to create energy and maintain homeostasis. Thus, a rise is seen in lactate production and decrease in glucose and pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Glycerol is mainly derived from the degradation of phospholipids in cell membrane and increases due to cell damage.</p><p>The ratio between the concentration of a metabolite in a dialysate and interstitial space is expressed as &#x0201c;relative recovery&#x0201d;. Recovery of a given dialysate is affected by numerous factors such as molecular weight, surface area of membrane (length and diameter), perfusion flow rate, diffusion rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Previous studies have described that relative recovery is inversely related to perfusion flow rate, i.e at a slow rate of nearly zero (0.33&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l/min) the relative recovery will be approaching 100&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. The metabolite recovery in present study was defined as 100&#x000a0;%, as relative recovery was not investigated.

The present study establishes microdialysis as an effective way to monitor interstitial levels of metabolites during tourniquet induced ischemia. The study was conducted to investigate metabolic changes distally in a limb, since the ischemia underneath the tourniquet has been described previously in literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The period of interest was when the limb was exposed to ischemia during surgery and the following time of reperfusion. The main findings showed that tourniquet use causes ischemia and cell damage as measured by metabolites. Significant ischemia can be detected in the affected limb until 3&#x000a0;h because of tourniquet use. All Marker levels were normalized after 5&#x000a0;h.</p><p>To our knowledge, this study is the first to assess the ischemic changes during TKA surgery caused by tourniquet use in a randomized setup.</p><p>The difference between the two groups illustrate that tourniquet application induces changes in level of metabolic markers, which are manifested up to 180&#x000a0;min of reperfusion.</p><p>The systemic response to surgery observed in the markers was adjusted for, by using the non-tourniquet group as reference and we concluded that the differences in marker levels are locally affected by the tourniquet induced ischemia.</p><p>In the tourniquet group there were significant changes of all the metabolites in the operated leg, when comparing baseline to measurements during reperfusion. The differences were present in all metabolites and were statistically significant comparing from baseline during reperfusion, before slowly returning to normal levels. The non-operated leg, that served as indicator for systemic response, was compared to the operated leg and significant difference were also present at the individual measurement points. The difference between the operated leg and non operated leg represents the local skeletal muscle response in the operated leg.</p><p>In the non-tourniquet group, levels of metabolites had changed in the operated leg when comparing baseline to postoperative measurements, but they returned to baseline values faster. Changes were similar to tourniquet group, but not as large or prolonged. When comparing the operated leg and reference leg there was no significant difference, indicating that a local response is not occurring and that the changes are due to an overall systemic response to surgery (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig5" ref-type="fig">5</xref>).</p><p>Thigh pain and swelling has been investigated in other studies, finding tourniquet application being the reason for increased pain and swelling due to ischemia and direct compression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Little is known about basal metabolite concentrations in interstial levels of resting skeletal muscle. Comparing to previous studies our baseline levels are in agreement with data reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. In these studies baseline levels ranged from 3.3&#x02013;5&#x000a0;mmol/L for glucose, between 1.9 &#x02013;2.4&#x000a0;mmol/l for lactate, between 40&#x02013;96&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L for glycerol, while pyruvate was only measured in one study at levels of around 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;mol/L [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>&#x000d6;stman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] used microdialysis to measure tourniquet induced ischemia in patients undergoing arthroscopic surgery. Here measurements were carried out over a time course of 120&#x000a0;min after tourniquet release. All the metabolites were affected and within 120&#x000a0;min the changes were restored back to normal values. The results are in consistence with this present study, where the same metabolite kinetics was observed.</p><p>Glycerol is a component of the cell plasma membrane and released into the interstitial space when cells are damaged during surgery. Glycerol can be used as a marker of cell destruction. In addition, high levels of glycerol may also be due to the hormonal regulation of lipolysis and hypoglycemia during tourniquet use which facilitates a catecholamine response that initiate a lipolysis reaction in skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This can partially be a reason for the high rise in glycerol concentration in the tourniquet group, combined with the mechanical compression of the tourniquet.</p><p>Increased L/P ratio is a precise marker of ischemia and we observed a difference from baseline immediately after surgery when using tourniquet. After a period of 60&#x000a0;min reperfusion L/P ratio levels were back to normal. In the non-Tq group no difference was observed.</p><p>Muscles are believed to be relatively resistant to ischemia, but even shorter or sudden periods of ischemia may result in an overload of calcium in the muscle and could in weaker patients induce secondary complications such as compartment syndrome and respiratory distress syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. This should be taken into consideration if tourniquets are applied.</p><p>Microdialysis is a minimally invasive technique that has limited risks for patients and even with small concentration volumes, monitoring of the ischemic changes is allowed. It is applicable despite reduced blood flow during ischemia and a continuous sampling of interstitial fluids can be performed. Microdialysis contains a major limitation when estimating data because only an approximation can be stated. Recovery depends upon many factors that affect the equilibrium. To achieve the highest recovery we used the largest membrane recommend to skeletal tissue and the lowest perfusion rate allowed. Most of the clinical studies available use relative recovery and by using very low flow the recovery will be reaching nearly 100&#x000a0;%.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study shows that using tourniquet in TKA surgery is associated with increased ischemia during first the postoperative hours but the changes are normalized after 5&#x000a0;h.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>AE: study design, data collection, statistics, analysis and writing.
