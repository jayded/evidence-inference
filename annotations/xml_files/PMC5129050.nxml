Suggested improvements included more mentorship; improved training; streamlined points recording. Pilot results indicated potential effectiveness ((adjusted mean difference (95% CI) p value; MVPA mins; 5.1 (1.1 to 9.2) p=0.014)) and suggest recruitment of 16 schools (2400 adolescents) for a full trial. Compared with control, intervention students reported greater peer support 0.5 (0.1 to 0.9) p=0.03, well-being 1.8 (0.1 to 3.4) p=0.04 but no difference in shyness/sociability.

Further, having one control school allowed for estimation of preliminary effectiveness and of the number of participants required to adequately power a full trial.

We conducted the feasibility study with the first school who agreed to participate (indicated by signing a school acceptance form). The school agreed to implement the GoActive intervention in the whole of year 9 and to allow us to conduct premeasurements and postmeasurements on consenting students, and was told that they would receive &#x000a3;200 of sports equipment for the school after completion of postintervention measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Participant recruitment</title><p>In the Summer term (April to July) of 2013 all year 9 students (n=234) and their parents at the participating school received invitation packs including study information and invitations for students to participate in preintervention and postintervention measurements. Parents were asked to provide passive consent (active opt-out consent) for their son/daughter to take part in the study measures. We gave parents at least 2&#x02005;weeks to respond to this invitation and another copy of the letter was sent after 1&#x02005;week. Parents were given the option to phone or email the study team if they did not consent for their child to take part in the study measures or they could complete a written opt-out form. Reminders and information about the study was additionally included in all relevant school media, including newsletters and emails and the usual reminders sent from the school. Written student assent was obtained by research assistants trained in good clinical practice prior to any measurements taking place.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Intervention</title><p>The GoActive intention has been described in detail previously,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and the components are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012335TB1">table 1</xref>. Briefly, GoActive aims to increase PA through increased peer support, self-efficacy, self-esteem, group cohesion and friendship quality, and is implemented in tutor groups using a tiered leadership system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2016012335F1">figure 1</xref>). Tutor groups choose two weekly activities each; mentors (older adolescents) and weekly peer leaders in each class encourage students to try these. Students gain points for trying new activities; points are entered into a between-class competition and weekly rewards are provided. Mentors and teachers support students to record and summarise their points. Mentors were to be given one training session by the study team and ongoing support by the intervention facilitators during the project. Teachers had a supportive role and were asked to encourage their class to participate and facilitate students to collect points.</p><table-wrap id="BMJOPEN2016012335TB1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Description of the GoActive intervention according to key components</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="left" span="1"/></colgroup><thead valign="bottom"><tr><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Concept</th><th align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Component</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Choice</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Each tutor group chooses two different activities weekly.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Novelty</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">There are currently 20 activities available, designed to use little or no equipment and to be different from the usual school sports.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mentorship</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Older adolescents (mentors) are paired with each year 9 class encourage participation in activities.<break/>Mentors are helped by year 9 in-class peer leaders who change weekly.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Competition</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Students gain points every time they do an activity; there is no time limit, students just have to try an activity to get points.<break/>Individual points are kept private with class level totals circulated to encourage interclass competition.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Rewards</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Students gain small individual prizes for reaching certain points levels.</td></tr><tr><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">Flexibility</td><td rowspan="1" colspan="1">At least one tutor time weekly is used to do an activity and participants are also encouraged to do activities at other times, including out of school.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><fig id="BMJOPEN2016012335F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Tiered leadership system.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjopen2016012335f01"/></fig><p>Tutor groups usually meet at the beginning of the school day and after lunch at British schools when students attend a short class; their form teacher marks attendance and gives out school notices.

<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The monitor was set to record vertical acceleration at 5&#x02005;s epochs. Participants were asked to wear the monitors during waking hours for 7&#x02005;days and to only remove them for water-based activities. Owing to resource constraints, not all participants could be offered an accelerometer; participants were randomly invited to wear a monitor with random numbers used to decide allocation prior to the measurement session. Participants wearing a monitor at baseline were first allocated a monitor at follow-up; remaining monitors were then allocated on a first come, first served basis to the remaining participants. Moreover, participants who had not returned a monitor from baseline were not invited to wear another at follow-up. After returning their monitors after the second measurement session, participants were offered a &#x000a3;10 Amazon voucher.</p><p>Accelerometry data were analysed using a batch processing programme (ActiLife) to remove periods of &#x02265;60&#x02005;min of continuous zeros<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17&#x02013;19</xref> which were classified as non-wear time.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The first (partial) day of measurement was not used for analysis.

Despite initial agreement, the school was unable to provide mentors as it was Summer term and the older students had examinations. Year 9 form teachers were trained to deliver the intervention prior to the programme starting; the teachers delivered the intervention with the help of one GoActive team member (KC or AS) during tutor time once per week. A total of 234 year 9 students were exposed to the intervention as reported by the school (N=234) with 9 parents (3.8% of eligible students) and 13 (5.6%) students opting out of participation in study measures. A total of N=183 (78.2%) assented to participate in measurements with 29 (12.4%) not attending a measurement session (eg, due to absence or apathy).</p><p>Participants were mean (SD) 13.7 (0.4) years old, 43.3% male and 26.9% were overweight or obese. Participants liked wearing the monitors and although only 113 participants were able to wear a monitor at baseline, 123 participants wore an accelerometer at follow-up and demand exceeded availability. Of the 87 participants who wore an Actigraph at both baseline and follow-up, 66% and 60% returned &#x02265;1 and &#x02265;3 valid days of data, respectively. Unfortunately a school trip on the postintervention measurement day meant that some participants who wore a monitor at baseline were unable to be assessed at follow-up; this is rationale for introducing multiple measurement days per wave per school. Participant information is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012335TB2">table 2</xref>.</p><sec id="s6a"><title>Process evaluation</title><p>Student quotes have been selected where relevant to support the suggested programme changes, prior to the pilot trial, as summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012335TB3">table 3</xref>. In brief, the main changes required between the feasibility and pilot trial regarding the intervention were identified as (1) the need for mentors, (2) better initial support and training, (3) a simplified points system and (4) a boy and a girl in-class peer leader each week. Regarding measurements, the needs identified included word substitutions and font/colour change for improved questionnaire completion, multiple measurement sessions per school, no monetary incentives and multiple strategies for monitor return.</p><p>Of 9 eligible form teachers involved in the project, 8 completed questionnaires; 7/8 teachers enjoyed the programme, 7/8 thought that their class did more activity, 6/8 thought that their class found it fun, 3/8 thought it was a lot of work and only 2/8 thought that their class found it boring. Most of the free-text comments highlighted the need for improved organisation and information provision at the beginning of the project and confirmed the importance of mentors. Teacher suggestions are included in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012335TB3">table 3</xref> where relevant.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s7"><title>Feasibility study discussion</title><p>We were successful in recruiting and consenting 78.2% of a year group to measurements and delivering the intervention to the whole year group. Although only 9 parents opted their son/daughter out of measurements and 13 students did not assent to measurements, 29 (12.4%) of eligible participants did not attend a measurement session due to school-reported absences, illnesses, forgetfulness and apathy. Clear pointers for improvement were identified based on feedback from schools, teachers, students and our process evaluation data. These suggested improvements related to the intervention and also to the measurement sessions and highlight the value of a feasibility study of an intervention programme and evaluation methods irrespective of the previous research experience of the team. The changes required between the feasibility and pilot stages of this project are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012335TB3">table 3</xref> and are presented as broad themes in this discussion to avoid repetition.</p><p>Many of the improvements needed regarding the intervention relate to communication and training between the research team and the school. These issues were relatively difficult to address and warranted further piloting to improve various elements of the programme and evaluation. We were surprised by how difficult it was to recruit mentors given that the school was initially very keen on this element of the programme; we hoped that running the intervention in a school term without examinations might be more successful. Also, despite running a training session for form teachers, not all attended and it was difficult to gain contact to the other teachers in order to convey the salient information. We were able to run the programme in all year 9 tutor groups but it took a few weeks of research team efforts to get some of the classes fully understanding and participating.</p><p>Suggested changes to the measurement methods were mainly operational and theoretically relatively easily addressed as they are mainly regarding logistics of study conduct. However, some suggestions such as organising different days of measurement sessions at each school require collaboration from the school and may prove more challenging.</p><p>The majority of the changes required are either surrounding the need for improved communication between the research team and the school and second aligning initial promises by schools with what they are able to operationalise in practice.</p></sec><sec id="s8"><title>Pilot randomised controlled trial</title><p>In Autumn term 2013/Spring term 2014, we conducted a <italic>cluster-randomised controlled pilot trial</italic> in three schools (two intervention schools; ISRCTN31583496). The aim was to assess preliminary effectiveness and estimate the number of participants required to adequately power a full trial, to test measurement logistics, the feasibility of randomising schools and training intervention facilitators outside of the research team.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s9"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s9a"><title>Recruitment and randomisation</title><p>School recruitment, participant recruitment and consent procedures followed the process outlined for the feasibility study. All non-fee-paying (state), all-ability secondary schools within a 30&#x02005;min drive of the study office were sent a letter inviting them to take part; the first three to agree were included. Following successful recruitment of three schools, recruitment of the remaining schools was no longer pursued. After recruitment, randomisation was conducted using random number generation by an individual outside of the research team. The control school was offered (but did not take) the full GoActive programme materials and preprogramme training after completion of follow-up study measurements.</p></sec><sec id="s9b"><title>Mentor recruitment</title><p>Schools were asked to recruit two older students per year 9 form to act as mentors; as mentorship involves a time commitment and a particular skillset (eg, able to lead year 9 and motivational individuals), we considered that it was most appropriate for schools to nominate students. After recruitment by the intervention schools, they were to be provided with written information regarding the study. A 1&#x02005;hour training session was then given to mentors by the study team prior to the start of the intervention and the mentors received ongoing support from the intervention facilitators.</p></sec><sec id="s9c"><title>Intervention delivery</title><p>The intervention was delivered to the whole of year 9 in both intervention schools. One school had &#x02018;vertical forms&#x02019; where tutor groups consisted of students in every year group in the school. GoActive was adapted accordingly with all forms (and therefore all age groups) participating in the GoActive activities with year 9 students attending measurement sessions and recording points. We had agreed with the school that mentors were to work across house groups rather than in individual forms; however, the school did not use mentors to deliver the intervention; instead form teachers filled this role. In the other intervention school (which had a traditional form structure), mentors were recruited and facilitators outside the research team worked with them as planned to deliver the intervention to the year 9 forms.</p></sec><sec id="s9d"><title>Measurements</title><p>Measurements occurred using the same format as the feasibility study; all measurements were conducted at baseline and 6&#x02013;8&#x02005;weeks after baseline (while the intervention was running) and where possible multiple measurement sessions were conducted at each school to enable us to measure participants who were absent on the day of measurement, who forgot to attend or who did not want to attend initially who changed their mind.</p><sec id="s9d1"><title>Accelerometer&#x02014;primary outcome</title><p>PA data were collected and summarised as described above, although all participants were asked to wear an accelerometer at baseline and follow-up.

Although the programme was improved compared with the feasibility study, the programme and evaluation methods still could benefit from further improvements. We used information from measurements, staff feedback, mentor and facilitator focus groups, and teacher questionnaires to iteratively improve the programme and evaluation. The changes required between the pilot study and a full effectiveness trial of GoActive are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="BMJOPEN2016012335TB3">table 3</xref> and are presented as broad themes in this discussion to avoid repetition.</p><p>Based on the pilot results, in a full trial, we would aim to detect a 5&#x02005;min difference in MVPA (min/day). A 5&#x02005;min increase is relevant at population level as it would increase the proportion of adolescents meeting the guidelines of 60&#x02005;min of MVPA per day from 43% to 50% (based on baseline pilot data), with potential to significantly impact on population health.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Based on this pilot data, we estimate N=1310 participants will be required for the primary effect analysis in a full trial. However, due to our low monitor compliance (39% in pilot trial) and to account for potential school drop-out, we aim to recruit 16 schools with 150 participants each (total N=2400; average recruitment per school in pilot=153). We have based these estimations on 30&#x02013;40% lost to follow-up as we are confident that our changes will improve monitor compliance in future. The levels of MVPA are comparable to previous assessments in 13&#x02013;14&#x02005;years old British adolescents.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> The MVPA of intervention and control groups decreased; taken together with other evidence showing declines of MVPA during adolescence,<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> adolescent PA promotion strategies may be valuable if preventing a decline even if not managing to increase MVPA. It was a limitation of this pilot CRCT that we only included one control school; this was partly due to time and resource restrictions for this pilot phase of research. However, including one control school allowed us to meet the main aims of our pilot CRCT of assessing trial logistics (including randomisation of schools) and estimating preliminary effectiveness. We were able to use data on school-level variability in MVPA from a previous study across multiple secondary schools to incorporate in our power calculations for the full trial.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref></p><p>In the pilot CRCT we recruited mentors in one intervention school but not the other. From this, we learnt the importance of continued communication with school contact teachers and aligning initial promises by schools with what they are able to operationalise in practice. Issues surrounding communication still require improvement and show the need to streamline information for mentors, teachers and students to ensure it is comprehensive and consistent. In future, we plan to do this through videos explaining the evaluation and the intervention programme and also with individual activity videos for use during tutor time.</p></sec><sec id="s15"><title>Overall discussion</title><p>We aimed to assess the feasibility of study procedures and the implementation of the GoActive intervention across the whole of year 9, and to estimate preliminary effectiveness. Further, we aimed to estimate the number of participants required to adequately power a full trial to assess the effectiveness of the GoActive intervention to increase MVPA among 13&#x02013;14&#x02005;years old adolescents. We successfully ran the programme in three schools and assessed preliminary effectiveness, allowing for drop-out we would need to recruit 16 schools with 150 participants each (total N=2400) for a full trial.</p><sec id="s15a"><title>Improving participant retention</title><p>We used parental opt-out consent in the research reported here and found that our initial recruitment rates over the feasibility (78%) and pilot trial (77%) using this strategy were substantially higher than our previous UK-based research in this age group using parental opt-in consent (23% of eligible participants).<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> However, despite high recruitment and retention, the number of participants available for analysis of the main outcome was lower than expected, predominantly due to difficulties with monitor wear and return at follow-up. This was irrespective of our liberal inclusion criteria of including all participants with at least one valid day of data; limiting the ability of these results to be representative of habitual activity. After speaking to participating schools and students, and with other investigators, in the full trial, we will aim to use various methods to improve monitor wear compliance and return such as increased emphasis on the importance of wear and return during the measurement session, multiple reminders to wear monitors during the measurement period, and teacher assistance. Obtaining parental opt-out consent has enabled us to recruit a higher proportion of the sample, but comes with drawbacks. This includes that we do not have access to parent or student mobile phone numbers so cannot provide reminders via text messages. However, we will aim for a key member of project staff to build good relationships with two key staff members from each school during the project to help improve communication, and with that, accelerometer wear and return rates.</p></sec><sec id="s15b"><title>Increasing emphasis on mentoring</title><p>The experience of conducting the feasibility and pilot trial resulted in multiple lessons learnt and subsequent improvements to the intervention design at each stage of the project. Improvements between the feasibility and pilot study focused on a greater emphasis on mentorship, training of mentors and staff, streamlined recording of intervention points and standardisation of intervention delivery. We were surprised by the difficulty in recruiting and training mentors, despite schools liking this element of the programme and leadership training already being common at secondary schools. We had no success in recruiting mentors in the feasibility study and although we were successful in recruiting mentors for the pilot trial in one school, mentor feedback suggested that more thorough training and support was necessary prior to intervention initiation. Rather than a 1-hour training session as conducted for the pilot CRCT, we plan a full day session which will hopefully alleviate these issues and provide a stronger basis for the intervention. In one pilot school, we were unsuccessful contacting mentors despite promises from the school. This highlights the need to keep in regular contact with the contact teacher and to confirm that intervention steps have been completed prior to the intervention beginning. These issues were likely exacerbated by the short time frame in which we had to recruit schools and begin the intervention. Teachers told us that it would be easier with a longer lead time for schools; therefore, the full trial allows recruitment two terms prior to the intervention starting to allow for sufficient preparation, mentor recruitment, and training for teachers and mentors. Although there are clearly challenges with mentors (15&#x02013;18&#x02005;years old) being expected to deliver the bulk of the intervention, this is an increasingly popular strategy in health promotion research<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> and means that programmes are potentially more cost-effective and sustainable. To further support the mentors through the initial weeks of the intervention, we will allocate an externally funded facilitator half a day per week to each intervention school.</p></sec><sec id="s15c"><title>Developing the intervention website</title><p>Mentors and teachers found supporting students recording points challenging so funding is allocated within the full trial budget to enable further development of the website platform to enable electronic submission and tracking of points. Further, we plan for this website to contain sufficient information for a school to run GoActive independently which could facilitate potential future use of the intervention with limited outside support. An information video will also be produced which will explain the difference between intervention and control conditions and provide a brief explanation of the GoActive intervention for use at the beginning of the study to ensure consistency of explanation. This will also allow mentors and teachers to remind themselves of the process during the challenging initial phases of the project.</p></sec><sec id="s15d"><title>Refining measurement sessions</title><p>Our process evaluation and focus groups also provided insight into how we could improve the study design in general, including the measurement sessions. We believe that this type of information, while rarely published, is valuable to the progression of the GoActive study but also for other researchers assessing PA at secondary schools. This information included the organisation of more than one measurement session per school at each time point as non-attendance on this day may influence recruitment and retention. Further, as suggested by teachers, we will print questionnaires on coloured paper, in at least size 12 font without serifs to help students with reading difficulties. Our secondary outcomes indicated no evidence of harm but we will continue to monitor any potentially adverse events in future work.</p></sec><sec id="s15e"><title>Incentivising teachers</title><p>It was noticeable from some of the student focus groups during the feasibility study that the enthusiasm of the teacher was important for adherence to the intervention; students were more positive about the intervention when the form teacher was really invested in the programme. This was highlighted when a participant who initially did not record points moved forms and stated in the focus groups how much he liked the programme, and had participated when motivated by his new class. We plan to incentivise teachers in intervention schools by giving small gifts at the end of the study for those whose forms engage. To further standardise intervention delivery and provide a consistent element of the intervention across schools, we aim to develop activity videos to be used. This was suggested by a teacher to reduce burden of this intervention being delivered during tutor time in which other demands are placed on teachers' time.</p><p>While we collected valuable qualitative data during our participant and mentor focus groups, we did not have time to conduct formal qualitative analysis and we were also unable to conduct student focus groups after the pilot phase. These are limitations of this research but were necessary in order to progress the research at a timely pace, and to meet the timing of funding calls. However, it is important to use and publish this type of feasibility and pilot research as stated previously<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> as often it is not properly used by researchers let alone published to enable use by others developing similar programmes. The nature of this formative research often requires long papers which may be difficult to publish. By combining feasibility, pilot and lessons learnt in one paper, we are hopefully highlighting the most useful and salient and messages without an excessive number of publications. We did not collect cost-effectiveness data in the feasibility and pilot studies and will put in place school-relevant mechanisms to collect the relevant data in the full trial.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="s16"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The feasibility study and pilot trial of the GoActive intervention showed feasibility of recruitment, measurement, randomisation and the ability to deliver GoActive to a whole school year group of 13&#x02013;14&#x02005;years old. Both of these stages prompted several key improvements to the intervention and to the study design including emphasis on monitor return, mentor recruitment, adequate mentor training, clearer and more consistent intervention explanations, and improved points recording systems. The lessons learnt from each phase of this research have been taken forward to an ongoing full trial to evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the GoActive intervention to increase MVPA among 13&#x02013;14&#x02005;years old.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Twitter:</bold> Follow Helen Elizabeth Brown at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://twitter.com/HelenEliz_Brown">@HelenEliz_Brown</ext-link></p></fn><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> KC conceived of the study, conducted quantitative analyses and drafted the manuscript.
