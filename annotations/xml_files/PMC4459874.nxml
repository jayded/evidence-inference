Vaccine-specific memory B-cell response was measured at Day 0 and Day 84 by vaccine-specific Enzyme-linked Immunospot (ELISpot) assay.

HI titers against both influenza A strains as well as memory B-cell response were modestly higher in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the placebo group but the difference was not statistically significant.

The parasites are able to influence the immune system from a T-helper 1 type response to a T-helper 2 type response. There is evidence that in infected individuals the immune response following vaccination is impaired. Thus pre-treatment with a single-dose of an antihelminthic treatment before vaccination could be a simple and cost-effective intervention to improve vaccine efficacy. In the present study we investigated whether a single-dose antihelminthic treatment with albendazole influences the vaccine outcome to a seasonal influenza vaccine in primary school children living in Gabon, Central Africa. We observed a trend towards a higher anti-viral antibody titer after vaccination in the pre-treated group compared to the placebo control group, albeit not statistical significant. Furthermore we detected a higher concentration of total IgA but not of vaccine-specific IgA. In conclusion, our findings show subtle effects of antihelminthic pre-treatment but are not conclusive enough to recommend a single-dose of albendazole before vaccination to improve vaccine immunogenicity but encourage to conduct further studies in endemic areas with other treatment regiments.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was funded by the Bundesministerium f&#x000fc;r Bildung und Forschung (BMBF).

As access to public health programs is widely lacking, geohelminthiasis is considered by the World Health Organization (WHO) as one of the most neglected tropical diseases with serious health, nutritional and social outcomes for the affected individuals[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>].

Usually, T-helper type 2 (Th2) immune responses[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] are predominant and a general suppression of innate and adaptive T- and B-cell responses via the activation of regulatory T-cells (Treg) and/or induction of anti-inflammatory cytokines[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] may lead to general hyporesponsiveness of the immune system[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Vaccination is one of the most effective tools to prevent infectious diseases. Nonetheless seroconversion and therefore efficacy are variable in vaccinated individuals depending on age, environment and genetic host factors[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].

There is evidence that the presence of geohelminths, especially <italic>T</italic>. <italic>trichiura</italic> negatively influences immune responses against GMZ2, a malaria vaccine candidate[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Past studies from Gabon showed that Gabonese school children are heavily infected with intestinal parasites (infection rates of <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> 46%, or <italic>T</italic>. <italic>trichiura</italic> 71%) and 74% of examined children were at least positive for one of the investigated helminths[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Regular antihelminthic treatment in high-risk groups like school children is considered as an effective tool for controlling the burden of geohelminth infection but is not widely implemented in Gabon. The WHO promotes helminth control by periodic deworming once or twice a year, depending on prevalence, as a cost-effective intervention[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].

A study recently conducted in rural Gabon showed that children infected with helminths had an impaired antibody response against an influenza vaccine compared to those free of infection[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. During a phase Ib trial investigating immunogenicity of the malaria vaccine candidate GMZ2 in Gabonese children those infected with <italic>T</italic>. <italic>trichiura</italic> exhibited a lower antibody response against the vaccine antigens compared to those who were not infected with the parasite[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Since these and other studies in animal models and humans [<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>] show that helminths and other intestinal infections negatively influence vaccine immunogenicity we conducted a study to test the hypothesis that antihelminthic treatment prior to vaccination will increase immune responses to vaccine antigens.</p><p>Because antibody response towards vaccine antigens is a surrogate marker for protection in areas where infectious diseases are highly endemic an effective immune response to vaccinated antigens is very important[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].</p><p>In the present study anti-viral antibody response was analyzed by HI test for each of the three influenza strains administered with a seasonal vaccine. The influenza vaccine was selected because a single-dose is sufficient to raise antibody responses towards a protective titer and the vaccine is not part of the Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) in Gabon. Therefore, no or only low baseline titers would presumably be present in the study population. As expected there was an increase of HI titers against each vaccine strain after vaccination at Day 28 and Day 84 in all participants. This was observed mainly for the antibody concentration against the influenza A strains A(H1N1)pdm09 and A(H3N2). The low but frequently seen baseline HI titers against the influenza A (H1N1) and A(H3N2) in some participants suggest that these children were already in contact with circulating virus strains or that they have cross-reactive antibodies from recent circulating influenza strains or from other cross-reactive pathogens. In the present study we assessed that total IgA concentrations were higher in individuals of the antihelminthic treated group compared to the control group four weeks following vaccination. Because IgA is crucial for the control of influenza[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>] and vaccine-specific IgA can be detected in mice following influenza vaccination[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] we also measured vaccine-specific IgA but saw no difference between the groups. Since total IgA was not different at baseline we do not know if the difference of total IgA at Day 28 is an effect of vaccination or a late effect of the antihelminthic treatment. This effect should be further investigated in more detail in particular because IgA has an important function during the defense of airborne and gastrointestinal infections. However in our setting we have not examined the role of this finding and we have not determined secretory IgA.</p><p>Besides we could show that the number of vaccine-specific ASCs representing memory B-cells was elevated in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the control group but this difference did also not reach statistical significance. We assume that the already existing ASCs at baseline in samples of some participants are due to previous influenza infections. Since the antibody titers as well as the number of ASCs were not significantly elevated in the antihelminthic treated group the question arises if a better or more effective antihelminthic treatment would have had clearer effects on the vaccine immunogenicity. The fact that the overall helminth burden did not differ between the visits implies that single-dose antihelminthic treatment is not sufficient to cure or to prevent relevant helminth infection or that reinfection occurs rapidly. This becomes more evident since Adegnika et al. very recently showed that short antihelminthic treatment regimens are efficacious to cure <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic> but not <italic>T</italic>. <italic>trichiura</italic> infection. To eliminate <italic>T</italic>. <italic>trichiura</italic> infection at least a double treatment seems to be necessary[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Therefore in our setting the treatment regimen was not adequate to eliminate helminths sufficiently and to reconstitute the immune system. Cooper et al. investigated the effect of a double-dose (2x200mg) albendazole treatment prior to an oral cholera vaccination leading to a highly significant increase in anti-vibriocidal antibodies[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. In contrast to the present study, the investigators only included individuals carrying <italic>A</italic>. <italic>lumbricoides</italic>[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. In our setting we retrospectively analyzed the helminth burden of the volunteers at the end of the study and noticed that the number of infections amongst primary school children was not as high as originally suggested from recent studies, which reduces the power of our analyses. In a study performed 2004 the overall prevalence of helminth infection was 74%[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], whereas in our study population the worm burden was only 21%. This could be due to different reasons. First, in the study conducted by van den Biggelaar et al. the Kato Katz method to detect the egg load in fresh stool samples was used[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] whereas we used the MIF technique to detect the worm burden in preserved stool samples at the end of the study to ensure all investigators were blind to the infection status of the participants. The Kato Katz method has a higher sensitivity[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>] compared to the MIF-technique[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] and this may explain partially the unexpected low prevalence of helminth infection although other studies using the same methodology gave higher prevalence rates. Besides the possibility that it is a chance finding the reduction of worm burden could be due to better public health facilities and better education of the population as well as to mass drug administration (MDA) even when it is administered on an irregular basis or by uncontrolled self-mediation. Gabon is a highly endemic country for STH according to the WHO, therefore MDA is recommended but in the region where the study was performed it is not regularly administered[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Private use is difficult to assess since individuals do not need prescription to buy antihelminthic treatment over-the-counter[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and often the individuals do not report the use of antihelminthic treatment. Furthermore it could be that a member of a household was recently treated and therefore also infection of other family members decreased[<xref rid="pntd.0003768.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Taken all this into account our in our study population the helminth burden was lower as expected for reasons which were not elicited in this study and our sample size was not powered for such a low helminth prevalence.</p><p>In conclusion, we showed that in our setting there was non-significant difference in virus-specific HI titers and ASCs against the vaccine antigens between the antihelminthic treated and the placebo group. Furthermore at Day 28 post vaccination total IgA was higher in the antihelminthic treated group compared to the control group. But there was no difference comparing vaccine-specific IgA titers. We can only speculate if a single dose antihelminthic treatment is sufficient to increase vaccine immunogenicity in a setting with higher helminth prevalence or if an appropriate more powerful treatment could contribute to a better immune response to vaccination. This has to be investigated in more detail and with different antihelminthic regiments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec023"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003768.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>Consort checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pntd.0003768.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the NRZ Influenza team of the RKI for performing the HI assays, Sonja Killinger for logistics and data entry, the staff of CERMEL and all participants as well as the members of the Institute for Clinical Epidemiology and applied Biometry in T&#x000fc;bingen.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pntd.0003768.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
