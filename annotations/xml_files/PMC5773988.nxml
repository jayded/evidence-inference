Since images are reformatted, streak artifacts that degrade bone visualization at direct coronal CT are projected over the crowns of the teeth, permitting optimal viewing of bone. As a result, these programs have been successfully used to evaluate implants, cysts, tumors, and surgical procedures. The developments of dental CT reformatting programs, however, have completely revolutionized and changed the fashion, in which we radiographically evaluate the jaw today.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The programs are useful because they provide accurate information about the height and width of the jaws as well as information about the location of vital structures.</p><p>The technique of dental CT, also called Dentascan, was developed by[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Schwarz <italic>et al</italic>. in 1987. They first used curved multiplaner reconstruction of the jaw.</p><p>Periodontal therapy involves the elimination of bacterial plaque and the correction of anatomical defects produced by disease process. Both nonsurgical and surgical treatment modalities have been used to manage periodontal diseases. It is assumed that the application of bone grafts would potentially manipulate the biological response into a regenerative rather than a predominantly reparative pattern of periodontal healing.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The use of bone grafts for reconstruction of osseous defects produced by periodontal diseases dates back to 1923 by[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Hegedus and was popularized by[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Nabers and O'leary in 1965. Many osseous grafting materials have been used toward the goal of obtaining periodontal regeneration, for example, autografts, allografts, heterografts (or xenografts), and alloplastic materials. These various grafting materials may produce radiographic evidence of bone fill and clinical evidence of improvement in probing depth and clinical attachment level (CAL).[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Schwartz <italic>et al</italic>. 1998 reported that variations in the amount of bone formation induced by demineralized freeze-dried bone allograft (DFDBA) were related to the source and processing of the bone. In addition to processing variations, it has been demonstrated that young donor bone results in significantly greater quantities of bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) retained in the bone allograft matrix compared with older donor bone. On the other hand, bovine bone grafts (BBGs) have long been used in the treatment of periodontal bone defects because of their potential for periodontal regeneration.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Due to a paucity of literature on the role of Dentascan in periodontics, the purpose of the present study was to envisage the effectiveness of DFDBA and BBG for promoting defect fill in periodontal intrabony defects using Dentascan.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A cross-sectional study was conducted in the Department of Periodontology, faculty of dental sciences, K.

Full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was reflected on facial/buccal and lingual/palatal exposing crestal bone using periosteal elevator to expose the test area. The vertical releasing incision was given when needed for better access. Papilla preservation flap was performed where interproximal spaces were available to ensure maximum closure and graft coverage postsurgically. The exposed intraosseous defect was debrided of granulation tissue using hand curettes. Adjacent tooth surfaces were planed with area specific curettes. The defect area was irrigated with sterilized saline to get rid off the residual debris. Osseous grafts (DFDBA or BBG) were placed in the defects as assigned. Flaps were repositioned, and complete closure was achieved. Interrupted or horizontal mattress sutures (3-0) were used and periodontal dressing was applied over the surgical site.</p><p>After surgery, subjects were prescribed amoxicillin with clavulanic acid (625 mg) TDS, anti-inflammatory (Ibugesic 400 mg) three times per day and B-complex 1 capsule daily for 5 days. Subjects were instructed to rinse twice daily with 0.2% chlorhexidine and not to brush in the treated area for the first 2 weeks. One week after surgery sutures and periodontal dressing were removed. The site was cleaned, and the periodontal dressing was replaced if needed. The subjects were recalled every 4 weeks for 6 months for oral hygiene evaluation and prophylaxis.

Test and control intrabony defect groups were homogeneous at baseline, and each subject participating in the study showed good oral hygiene level and a healthy gingival status. Among all the bone graft materials being developed, DFDBA has been shown in clinical trials, controlled studies, and human histological evaluations to be a highly efficacious materials for the reconstruction of periodontal osseous defects and the regeneration of the periodontium.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] BBG has recently been shown to have the potential for periodontal regeneration.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Although, there is no denying fact that the most reliable method to assess the amount of bone fill is surgical reentry, yet in this study second surgical procedure was not performed. Trejo <italic>et al</italic>. 1998[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] emphasized that second surgical trauma to the subjects add to the disruption of the attachment apparatus and may account for the resultant significant loss of attachment and bone fill.</p><p>Clinical examination and periapical radiographs are generally sufficient in the pre- and postoperative hard tissue measurements. Usually, these are affected by common errors such as angulations and distortion. Even with the best-standardized technique, the radiograph does not show the entire topography of the area before or after treatment.</p><p>A comparative study of pretreatment bone levels and posttherapy bone gains shows that linear radiographic analysis significantly underestimates pretreatment bone loss and posttreatment bone fill.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Therefore, in the present study Dentascan, a unique new computer software program which provides CT imaging was used. It offers significant potential for identifying mineralized structures and enhances the usefulness of radiographic evaluation by measuring coronoapical, mesiodistal and buccolingual bone loss/fill.</p><p>The particle size of DFDBA and BBG used in this study was &#x0003e;1040 &#x003bc; and 1000&#x02013;2000 &#x003bc;, respectively. Fucini <italic>et al</italic>. 1993[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] however concluded that there is no statistic significant difference between defects grafted with different particle sizes of DFDBA when used in humans. At 6 months postsurgically, the percentage reduction of PPD in TG1 was 45.2%, 40.9% in TG2, and 32.6% in the CG[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Highly significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) reduction of PPD was obtained both with TG1 and TG2 when compared with CG. Comparable PPD reduction was reported by[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Scheyer <italic>et al</italic>. 2002.</p><p>Percentage gain in CAL after 6 months was 50% in TG1 whereas very little differences of 38.5% were observed in TG2 and 35.9% in the CG[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. In contrast to our study,[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Richardson <italic>et al</italic>. 1999 reported a gain of 2.6 &#x000b1; 1.6 mm and 3.6 &#x000b1; 1.9 mm with DFDBA and BBG, respectively. Rummelhart <italic>et al</italic>. 1989 documented a gain of 1.7 mm in CAL with DFDBA.</p><p>After 6 months, posttreatment coronoapiocal bone status decreased in all groups. The improvement was highest in TG1 (50%) followed byTG2 (41.4%) and least for CG (14.3%)[<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>]. On intragroup comparisons, significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.01 or <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001) reduction in coronoapical bone status was noted in all the groups. When compared to control significant coronoapical bone level reduction of 2.20 mm (3.5 fold) and 1.60 mm (2.9 fold) was noted in TG1 and TG2, respectively. Masters <italic>et al</italic>. 1996[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] also reported similar results of 2.20 mm bone fill with DFDBA.</p><p>According to the results, DFDBA (TG1) appeared to be a favorable graft material. Dissimilar results between our study and other studies can be attributed to the variation in the degree of DFDBA demineralization between the tissue banks, which might have an effect on bone fill.</p><p>With the use of Dentascan in the present study, it was possible to record two more measurements buccolingual and mesiodistal. The findings of our study demonstrated that TG1 and TG2 led to substantial improvement buccolingually when compared to nongrafted CG. Reduction in buccolingual bone status with TG1 (30.6%) was 5.3 and with TG2 (18.9%) 3.3 fold higher than the CG (5.7%). While in buccolingual measurements, no significant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) was present when TG1, TG2, and CG were compared at 6 months from baseline. Bone status mesiodistally showed significant reduction (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) only in TG1 at 6 months when compared to baseline. Nonsignificant difference (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) was noted in TG2 and CG at 6 months period [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>].</p><p>It was interesting to note that TG1 (DFDBA) maintained consistency in reducing all the three bony parameters, thus proving a better treatment choice for the management of two wall intrabony defects. Appreciable results of DFDBA (TG1) might be attributed to the exposure of BMPs on demineralization which subsequently stimulated new bone formation.</p><p>Within the limits of the present study, it can be concluded that at 6 months after surgery both the grafts resulted in significant PPD reduction and CAL gain. Although significant improvement was noted in bone fill and percentage gain with both the materials DFDBA (TG1) and BBG (TG2), there was no significant difference between the two. However, DFDBA was found to be superior to BBG. Further longitudinal studies with larger sample size and use of barrier membranes should be undertaken to substantiate the osteogenic potential of DFDBA and BBG.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>DFDBA is better treatment choice in compare to BBG for the management of two wall intrabony defects.</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abrahams</surname><given-names>JJ</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Dental CT imaging: A look at the jaw</article-title><source>Radiology</source><year>2001</year><volume>219</volume><fpage>334</fpage><lpage>45</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11323454</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>MS</given-names></name><name><surname>Rothman</surname><given-names>SL</given-names></name><name><surname>Rhodes</surname><given-names>ML</given-names></name><name><surname>Chafetz</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Computed tomography: Part I.
