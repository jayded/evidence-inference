With many drug classes available, translational studies are needed to identify the most effective, safe, and simplest antidiabetes treatment sequences. Practical treatment strategies that achieve and maintain glycated hemoglobin (A1C) levels at &#x0003c;7% while minimizing hypoglycemia and weight gain are especially desirable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>).</p><p>Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) reduce A1C by 0.8&#x02013;1.5% and weight by 2&#x02013;3 kg on average in combination with metformin (depending on study populations and other background therapy), and are associated with a low risk of hypoglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>). Although the durability of effectiveness of GLP-1RAs has not yet been established, most other type 2 diabetes drugs fail after several years, such that many patients eventually require insulin treatment to attain and sustain glycemic control. This is typically achieved by adding a basal insulin to previous medications because such insulins are associated with modest hypoglycemia risk and weight gain compared with premixed and prandial insulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>). The side effects of insulin might be mitigated if used with a GLP-1RA; however, to date, there have been only trials adding GLP-1RAs to insulin and no well-controlled trials examining basal insulin added to existing GLP-1RA therapy. In this trial, for the first time, we evaluated a novel treatment intensification sequence: adding a GLP-1RA (liraglutide) to metformin followed by a randomized, open-label investigation of further intensification with systematically titrated basal insulin (insulin detemir) in participants with &#x02265;7% A1C.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><sec id="s3"><title>Participants</title><p>Eligible participants were insulin-na&#x000ef;ve adults (18&#x02013;80 years) with type 2 diabetes treated for &#x02265;3 months with &#x02265;1,500 mg/day metformin and A1C values of 7.0&#x02013;10.0% or with metformin and sulfonylurea (less than or equal to half of the maximum approved dose) and A1C values of 7.0&#x02013;8.5% (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc11-1928/-/DC1">Supplementary Data online</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Trial design and interventions</title><p>The trial was conducted in 202 office- or hospital-based sites in Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, the U.K., and the U.S. between 3 March 2009 and 19 April 2010.

With 12 weeks of liraglutide + metformin treatment, 61% of run-in completers reached an A1C &#x0003c;7%. For the 39% of completers not initially achieving target, adding insulin detemir provided clinically relevant further reductions of mean A1C from 7.6 to 7.1%. A total of 43% of insulin detemir recipients then achieved the &#x0003c;7% A1C target, compared with 17% continuing treatment with metformin + liraglutide. In the observational group, all of whom achieved A1C &#x0003c;7% after the 12-week run-in, 74% remained at target after a further 26 weeks&#x02019; treatment. Translated into clinical practice, and extrapolating from all patients who completed run-in, sequential intensification enabled approximately three-quarters of patients to achieve an A1C &#x0003c;7%. Importantly, overall, the hypoglycemia risk was very low, and insulin detemir recipients maintained the significant weight reductions achieved during liraglutide run-in rather than gaining weight as typically occurs with insulin.</p><p>Traditional clinical practice initiates insulin when multiple oral therapies are no longer effective. However, after metformin, commonly used oral agents such as sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones carry side effects, particularly hypoglycemia and/or weight gain; the exceptions are dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors and &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitors, which are weight-neutral but appear to show less glucose-lowering activity than other agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Because GLP-1RAs provide greater glycemic efficacy and weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), they may be more beneficial than these oral agents after metformin, but less acceptable in some patients because of gastrointestinal side effects and the injection barrier. Insulin initiation also usually causes weight gain and an increased hypoglycemia risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). In this study, however, the insulin detemir group maintained the initial weight loss achieved by adding liraglutide to metformin. Subsequent intensification with insulin detemir allowed 43% of the group to reach the glycemic target. It is conceivable that more aggressive insulin titration, giving higher insulin doses, would allow even more patients to reach A1C target, but perhaps at the expense of more hypoglycemia. The incidence of confirmed minor hypoglycemia with insulin detemir in our study, 0.286 events per participant-year, was considerably lower than the 1.3&#x02013;3.67 events per participant-year in previous trials with insulin detemir added to oral agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Although withdrawing sulfonylureas (as in the run-in) is associated with decreased hypoglycemia risks (3.2 vs. 1.6 events per participant-year, despite an increased insulin requirement) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), initiating liraglutide before detemir may further reduce the hypoglycemia risk, perhaps by modulating endogenous glucose-dependent insulin secretion and glucagon secretion as well as body weight, thereby lowering exogenous insulin requirements.</p><p>It remains unknown whether an association exists between incretin-based therapies and pancreatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>), but acute pancreatitis is known to be about three times more common in patients with type 2 diabetes than in the general population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>). In the present trial, two cases of pancreatitis were reported (one acute and one chronic) and neither case of pancreatitis was preceded by elevated lipase levels. Reports of pancreatitis were similarly uncommon in other liraglutide studies, although imbalances in pancreatitis are noted for liraglutide and other incretin-based therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). An initial small increase in median serum lipase below the upper limit of normal was observed across groups in the current study, and substantial fluctuations occurred over time. Interpreting these changes is difficult in the absence of an active comparator or a placebo group (i.e., a group not receiving liraglutide). Elevated lipase (or amylase) levels by themselves are insufficient to make a diagnosis of pancreatitis without the presence of abdominal pain and ideally confirmation with imaging studies. Most commonly, no gastrointestinal symptoms were associated with fluctuations in lipase observed during this trial.</p><p>We found no other published, prospective, controlled trials studying insulin added to a GLP-1RA in type 2 diabetes. A few previous studies have investigated the alternative intensification sequence, adding a GLP-1RA (specifically, twice-daily exenatide) to insulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In the only randomized, controlled trial to date, patients with more advanced disease at baseline (compared with the current study) already receiving 0.5 units/kg of insulin glargine were randomized to either add-on exenatide or continuation of basal insulin only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>). The insulin doses were optimized in both groups by further rigorous titration postrandomization. In this setting, add-on exenatide with insulin optimization was associated with a 1.7% reduction in A1C levels (from a baseline of 8.3&#x02013;6.7% vs. 1.0% A1C reduction with basal insulin optimization only), modest weight loss, and no significant increase in risk of minor hypoglycemia. In other nonrandomized studies, A1C reductions ranged from 0.0 to 0.9% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>). In the current study, however, adding a GLP-1RA before basal insulin was also effective, offering significantly improved glycemic control, substantial weight loss, and a very low hypoglycemia rate. This intensification sequence may therefore be preferable provided that potential gastrointestinal AEs can be accepted initially. It may also be preferable to initiate with a longer-acting once-daily GLP-1RA, such as liraglutide, rather than a twice-daily shorter-acting GLP-1RA to facilitate better compliance.</p><p>We acknowledge that our trial has some limitations. More participants may have reached glycemic targets with a lower FPG target for insulin titration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>). As some participants randomized to continued liraglutide + metformin subsequently reached target without dose adjustments, it is also conceivable that fewer patients would have needed insulin with a longer run-in period. Two factors may have influenced the outcome of the run-in period. First, the study used the higher (1.8 mg) of the two liraglutide doses. The higher dose may have favored efficacy outcomes and weight loss but adversely affected tolerability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>). Potentially, fewer patients may have withdrawn early due to gastrointestinal AEs if they had been permitted to return to the 1.2-mg dose or if upward titration was conducted more slowly. Second, one-third of participants were taking a sulfonylurea before the study; this was discontinued at the start of run-in and may have negatively influenced improvements in glycemic control but favored weight loss. However, neither factor should have affected the 26-week randomized-group comparisons. Moreover, discontinuation of sulfonylureas increases the trial&#x02019;s translational validity because many physicians add an injectable therapy only after failure of more than one oral agent, and then tend to withdraw sulfonylureas. We recognize that the randomized control group did not have a masked placebo or active comparator; this was mainly due to logistic limitations with insulin comparators. However, we also chose not to include an active comparator to retain the focus on the efficacy and safety of adding a basal insulin to a GLP-1RA in combination with metformin. It is possible that some participants were disappointed with their treatment allocation and withdrew, an effect that might not have occurred with an active comparator. It would be informative, however, if future trials adhered to the comparative effectiveness concept (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>). Future studies might also be of a longer duration and consider the overall costs of diabetes care (particularly the balance between the higher prices of new medications versus any potential for reduced costs associated with diabetes complications and less self-monitoring of blood glucose). A 26-week extension to the current study has been undertaken, primarily to assess longer-term treatment safety.</p><p>In conclusion, in type 2 diabetes with inadequate glycemic control on metformin &#x000b1; sulfonylurea, the addition of liraglutide was effective and safe, enabling the majority of participants to reach A1C levels &#x0003c;7%, with sustained weight loss and low hypoglycemia risk. For those not reaching glycemic targets, intensification with insulin detemir provided clinically relevant additional glycemic control, sustaining previous weight loss and the very low hypoglycemia risk.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
