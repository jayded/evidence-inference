Though a common surgical procedure, C-section recovery can be painful. Opioids, specifically codeine, are commonly used to ease pain; however, its active metabolite, morphine, passes into breast milk, and may produce unwanted side effects in neonates; therefore, alternatives to opioids are being sought. Reiki is an ancient Japanese form of healing where practitioners transfer healing energy through light touch and positive healing intention. Although 1.2 million Americans use reiki to reduce pain or depression, there is a lack of strong evidence supporting its effectiveness. A recent systematic review showed existing studies to be of poor methodological quality, with the common limitation of lack of blinding. To overcome this issue, the authors used distant reiki to assess its effectiveness in reducing pain following an elective C-section.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In this randomised, double-blinded study, women who underwent an elective C-section were allocated to either usual care (control, n=40) or three distant reiki sessions in addition to usual care (n=40). Pain was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The primary endpoint was the Area Under the VAS-Time Curve (AUC) for days 1&#x02013;3. Secondary measures included: the proportion of women who required opioid medications and dose consumed, rate of healing and vital signs.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>AUC for pain was not significantly different in the distant reiki and control groups (mean&#x000b1;SD; 212.1&#x000b1;104.7 vs 223.1&#x000b1;117.8; p=0.96). There were no significant differences in opioid consumption or rate of healing; however, the distant reiki group had a significantly lower heart rate (74.3&#x000b1;8.1&#x02005;bpm vs 79.8&#x000b1;7.9&#x02005;bpm, p=0.003) and blood pressure (106.4&#x000b1;9.7&#x02005;mm&#x02002;Hg vs 111.9&#x000b1;11.0&#x02005;mm&#x02002;Hg, p=0.02) post surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Distant reiki had no significant effect on pain following an elective C-section.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Trial Registration Number</title><p>ISRCTN79265996.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Article summary</title><sec><title>Article focus</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>This is the first randomised, double-blinded trial conducted on distant reiki.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The focus in on distant reiki's effects on pain after Caesarean section.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Special attention was paid to the methods of proper randomisation, patient allocation concealment and blinding.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Key messages</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Our trial suggests that distant reiki had no benefit in reducing patients' postpartum pain over usual care for elective Caesarean section.</p></list-item></list></sec><sec><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>We engaged a highly experienced reiki master to administer distant reiki removing the placebo effect which was present in all other pain trials. In addition, we maintained a high adherence to protocol, successful blinding of the research team, successful randomisation and patient allocation concealment, and diligent data collection with extremely few data points missed. We had good credibility with research participants, as all but 10 women refused to participate. We evaluated other aspects of healing after elective Caesarean section, beyond patients' perceived pain levels, by including the previously developed and published Milestone Questionnaire.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A potential limitation was the magnitude of pain on which we were attempting to show an impact. Just as acetaminophen is not suitable as pain medication after Caesarean section, distant reiki may also not be suitable for this magnitude of pain. In addition, since some patients were discharged early, our complete dataset is limited to 48&#x02005;h, with gaps in data for 16 patients (20%) accounted for by carrying the last pain score forward. To ensure that this method did not distort the results, we also evaluated AUC for pain on day 1 and day 2 individually and found no differences between groups for both these time periods.</p></list-item></list></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Pain</kwd><kwd>surgery</kwd><kwd>reiki</kwd><kwd>CAM</kwd><kwd>C-section</kwd><kwd>pain management</kwd><kwd>surgery</kwd><kwd>complementary medicine</kwd><kwd>obstetrics and gynaecology</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Approximately 25% of all babies in North America are delivered via Caesarean section (C-section)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>; alleviating pain early is important, as studies have shown that postoperative pain negatively affects a mother's ability to care for and breastfeed her infant.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref> To alleviate postoperative pain, opioids are commonly used after C-section.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref> For example, codeine, a common opioid, is a prodrug, and it is the relative biotransformation of codeine into morphine by the highly polymorphic cytochrome P450 enzyme 2D6 (CYP2D6) that is the single most important factor determining codeine analgesia in adults. Approximately 5&#x02013;10% of ingested codeine is converted into morphine; however, this percentage can increase dramatically in individuals who have multiple copies of the CYP2D6 allele.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref></p><p>We now know that morphine passes into breast milk. In 2005, a published study alerted the medical community to a case where a full-term breast-fed baby died from a morphine overdose as a result of his mother taking Tylenol no 3 with codeine to manage her pain; the mother had several copies of the CYP2D6 allele and had converted more than 10% of codeine into morphine.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> Maternal breast milk is considered the optimal nutrition for infants, and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6&#x02005;months of life.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> To ensure that all mothers who are recovering from C-sections and wish to breastfeed are able to do so safely, alternatives to opioids are sought.</p><p>Several complementary and alternative medicine therapies are used to alleviate pain. In an attempt to reduce or eliminate the need for opioid pain medication, we sought to examine the effect of distant reiki on pain. Reiki, an ancient Japanese form of hands-on healing, used to alleviate pain and depression,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> is classified as an Energy Medicine by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> Despite being an ancient Japanese practice, reiki is practised by over 1.5 million Americans, and its popularity is growing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref> It was promoted by Dr Oz, prominent cardiothoracic surgeon, host of the Dr Oz Show and frequent Oprah guest, as his &#x02018;ultimate complementary and alternative medicine therapy for 2010.&#x02019;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref> However, while it is commonly practised, there is no agreed-upon theory for how reiki might work, and its mechanism of action is still unknown.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref></p><p>Reiki practitioners believe that they can direct healing energy through their hands to their patients. To direct this energy, practitioners maintain a meditative presence and place their hands lightly over the person they are treating to aid in the patient's natural ability to heal. Reiki can be practised either proximally, with the patient located beside the practitioner, or distally, with the patient and practitioner in separate locations. Both types of reiki rely on the premise of a universal source of healing energy which a reiki practitioner can direct through intention.</p><p>A distant reiki treatment is like distant prayer, in that the practitioners are thinking of their patients from a distance. In distant reiki, reiki practitioners first undertake a specific protocol which allows them to send the healing energy to the patient. Second, practitioners mentally ask the person who is absent if he or she consents to treatment. Lastly, if practitioners do not hear a response or if they hear &#x02018;yes&#x02019; in their head, they follow the same procedure as for traditional reiki, but they place their hands on a substitute (eg, pillow) for the person being treated; if they hear &#x02018;no,&#x02019; the session ends immediately.</p><p>Reiki may work. Several studies have found a reduction in pain when using reiki<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12 b13 b14 b15">12&#x02013;15</xref>; furthermore, one of the studies found that women who received reiki after hysterectomy reported less pain and requested fewer analgesics.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> While there were no studies which specifically evaluated distant reiki for pain, one study found that distant reiki was as effective as traditional reiki in the management of depression and anxiety. The authors concluded that the distant reiki was as efficacious as traditional reiki, and the healing power of reiki was not due to placebo.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref></p><p>However, despite widespread and growing popularity, there is a dearth of well-conducted published scientific literature supporting or refuting reiki's efficacy. A recent systematic review of reiki found that while the vast majority of studies had positive therapeutic effects, all available studies scored poorly when methodological quality was measured using Jadad<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref>; thus, definitive conclusions about efficacy could not be made. A common source of potential bias was the lack of blinding of participants and assessors when using traditional reiki. Patient and medical-staff blinding to treatment allocation in a clinical trial is particularly important when the response criteria are subjective, such as alleviation of pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref> To overcome this limitation, we employed distant reiki in our trial.</p><p>Given the need for alternate pain-control treatments for breastfeeding mothers owing to the risk of morphine exposure in neonates, and the reduced pain observed in the women who received reiki after hysterectomy, our objective was to determine if distant reiki is effective in reducing pain after elective C-section, through a randomised double-blinded study.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methodology</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a double-blinded randomised clinical trial. The investigators, participants and healthcare staff directly involved with the participants were unaware of the group assignments. The study was approved by the research ethics board at St Michael's Hospital in Toronto, and all participants provided written informed consent prior to participation.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>All pregnant women who were scheduled to have an elective C-section were approached during a routine prenatal visit at the obstetrical clinic at St Michael's Hospital between 1 September 2008 and 31 March 2009. Criteria for exclusion included the following: having had previous experience with reiki or not planning to use standard postoperative pain medication. Women were recruited in either English or Spanish, and those who did speak other languages were approached if they had a translator with them, such as a husband or friend.</p><p>To ensure concealment of group assignment, the St Michael's Hospital research associate (SvdV) enrolled participants and then contacted the research assistant (YIG) at The Hospital for Sick Children with the participant's information (unique Hospital ID, date and time of C-section) for randomisation. YIG had previously generated the randomised number sequence in blocks of four or six. Participants were sequentially assigned (by YIG) to the random sequence, which was securely stored and password-protected on the Hospital for Sick Children network. If the patient was assigned to the distant reiki group, the research assistant (YIG) contacted the reiki master with the participant's information. If the patient was in the control group, no contact was made with the reiki master.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>Participants in the control group received usual medical and nursing care during their stay (typically 72&#x02005;h). The intervention group received usual care plus three distant reiki sessions, one each morning. The first session was administered on the morning of the C-section, at least 30&#x02005;min prior to surgery, and the second and third sessions were administered on the following mornings at approximately 08:00.</p><p>A single reiki master located over 100&#x02005;km away, who was trained in the Usui line of reiki and has been practising reiki for over 10&#x02005;years and regularly treats clients with distant reiki, administered the distant reiki interventions. Each distant reiki session lasted approximately 20&#x02005;min, and the reiki master followed the traditional Usui reiki protocol for distant healing.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> The unique Hospital ID was used as the identifier when sending distant reiki to the participant.</p><sec><title>C-section, anaesthesia and analgesia protocol</title><p>All elective C-sections at St Michael's Hospital were performed using the Pfannenstiel protocol.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref> Women who underwent elective C-sections received spinal anaesthesia with 0.75% bupivicaine, and 15&#x02005;&#x003bc;g of fentanyl lasting 2&#x02013;4&#x02005;h followed by 100&#x02005;&#x003bc;g of epidurally administered morphine, which typically lasts 12&#x02005;h.

We found no beneficial effect of distant reiki over usual care for pain reduction up to 3&#x02005;days after elective C-section.</p><p>The lack of an observed benefit of distant reiki for all pain outcome measures at all points in time is in contrast to most,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12 b13 b14 b15">12&#x02013;15</xref> but not all,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> earlier reiki pain studies. However, unlike all earlier published studies, our study differed in two key regards: firstly, ours was the only randomised and double-blinded trial. In addition to the patients not knowing their group assignment, the investigators and outcome assessors were unaware of the intervention assignment. This suggests that the therapeutic benefit of reiki for pain observed in previous, non-blinded studies was a placebo effect or that the magnitude of pain from an elective C-section is too great for distant reiki to make an impact.</p><p>Secondly, we employed distant reiki, and not traditional hands-on reiki, as our intervention. In considering the physiological effects of reiki, one of the basic teachings of healing with reiki is that we are more than our physical bodies. We also have an energy body made up of our aura (energy fields), the chakras (energy centres) and the meridians (energy pathways). Because reiki healers believe that reiki energy is not limited by time and distance, distant reiki healings can also be given without the client being present.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref> Reiki practitioners assert that a distant reiki intervention works by directing healing energy which engages the body by generating biological reactions such as pain reduction.</p><p>It is well accepted that many constituents of living systems communicate with each other via electromagnetic signals. A number of studies have demonstrated that weak electromagnetic fields (EMF) are capable of eliciting in vivo and in vitro effects from different biological systems. Endogenous electromagnetic and magnetic fields are associated with many basic physiological processes, ranging from ion binding and molecular conformation in the cell membrane to the macroscopic mechanical properties of tissues.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32 b33 b34 b35 b36 b37 b38 b39 b40 b41">32&#x02013;41</xref></p><p>In an attempt to validate energy therapies such as reiki, researchers have been measuring classical electromagnetic (EM) fields emitted by the body using both physical<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42 b43 b44 b45">42&#x02013;45</xref> and biological<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref> detectors. However, the intensity of these fields fades rapidly with distance, and thus cannot explain the effect of distant reiki.</p><p>One author<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref> has proposed that in addition to classical EM fields, the body generates non-classical and quantum fields, which do not fade with distance. Several studies have shown that quantum fields can influence neurological<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref> and immunological functions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref> at the cellular level. However, the idea that reiki energy works through quantum fields is highly controversial, and more scientific trials need to be conducted in this area.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the lack of observed effect is the study's sample size. Based on our calculations, the distant reiki would have had needed to have an effect size of 0.55; however, based on the AUC for pain, distant reiki had an effect size of 0.1, which is considered to be very small. Using this effect size, a total of 2530 patients (1265 per group) would have been needed to see a significant difference between groups. It is unlikely that the failure to find significant differences is due to selection bias, as only 10 women (12.5%) refused to participate in the study.</p><p>The Milestone Questionnaire which recorded time to first activity also showed no differences between groups. We evaluated these responses against the measures obtained by Roseag and colleagues,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref> and found all rates of healing to be similar to their published results, except for time to first eating solid foods, where our study showed an average of 10&#x02005;h longer for both groups. This could be due to the fact that St Michael's Hospital does not routinely allow women to eat solid foods until after they have passed gas, regardless of whether or not they are hungry.</p><p>Despite randomisation, there was a statistically significant difference between the two groups in birth weight; differences in maternal age approached significance. Our finding that a mother's perceived pain decreases with maternal age is consistent with previous studies.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref> However, we could not find any literature to support or refute the finding that larger babies born via elective C-section caused more pain. The increase in mothers' pain could be due to larger uteri which housed larger babies, thereby resulting in more pain as they contracted back to normal. In addition, lifting heavier babies post surgery could result in more pain for a recovering mother.</p><p>Heart rate taken approximately 4&#x02005;h after C-section and systolic blood pressure taken on day 3 at 08:00 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">table 2</xref>) were significantly lower in the distant reiki group compared with the control group. This is consistent with three studies,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> two of which<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref> specifically examined the physiological changes as a result of reiki. However, given that distant reiki's method of action is unknown, there is the possibility that our findings are simply due to chance, given the number of secondary measures evaluated. The small but statistically significant benefits of lower heart rate and blood-pressure levels are unlikely to be clinically significant but may be interesting to future researchers who are searching for a mechanism of action for distant reiki.</p><p>The generalisability of our study may be limited, given that one reiki master performed all of the distant reiki treatments; in addition, given the absence of information about the mechanism of action of distant reiki, we chose the same dosage that in a published trial using traditional reiki.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> Outcomes may differ given other reiki practitioners and other dosage regimes.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our trial showed no significant benefit of distant reiki (administered once per day) over usual care for pain management in the first 3&#x02005;days after elective C-section. It is not recommended as a method of primary pain relief for women undergoing an elective C-section.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supporting Statement</title></caption><media xlink:href="bmjopen-2010-000021-s1.pdf" xlink:type="simple" id="d32e1512" position="anchor" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e204" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Author's manuscript</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2010-000021.draft_revisions.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="d32e205" content-type="local-data"><caption><title>Reviewer comments</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="bmjopen-2010-000021.reviewer_comments.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank S Adams, reiki master, for providing the distant reiki sessions and for her continuous commitment to the project.
