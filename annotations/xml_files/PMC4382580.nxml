This inherited disorder is caused by a point mutation in the beta-globin gene. The mutant form of hemoglobin in SCD (Hb S) is capable of polymerization and complex molecular and structural changes within the red cell. Occurring in homozygotes (Hb SS) and in compound heterozygotes, such as those carrying Hb S and beta-thalassemia (Hb SB<sup>+</sup> or Hb SB<sup>0</sup>) and Hb S and hemoglobin C (Hb SC), hemolytic anemia and vaso-occlusion crises are the main complications of SCD. The illness tends to gradually develop toward multisystem organ failure.<xref rid="bib0005" ref-type="bibr"><sup>1</sup></xref> Bone involvement, frequently causing painful vaso-occlusive crises, is the most common clinical manifestation. Furthermore, bone involvement is a source of chronic, progressive disability, with long-term effects upon bone mass density, growth, and bone damage such as avascular necrosis and osteomyelitis. Osteopenia and osteoporosis are often asymptomatic; however, pain, fractures, deformities, and vertebral collapse may occur and require chronic analgesia, mechanical support, and surgical interventions.<xref rid="bib0010 bib0015" ref-type="bibr"><sup>2,3</sup></xref></p><p>Chronic and progressive damage such as, for example, avascular necrosis of the femoral head, the leading cause of hip deformity in these patients, commonly results in gait disturbances, pain, and activity and functional limitations in adult patients. Lower back pain is one of the main complaints among SCD patients and occurs due to the flattening and widening of the vertebral bodies with biconcave depressions of the endplates, probably caused by infarction of the central portion of the vertebral body.<xref rid="bib0020 bib0025" ref-type="bibr"><sup>4,5</sup></xref> There are few studies in the literature on the role of physiotherapy as a resource to prevent and treat locomotor system disorders in SCD individuals.</p><p>According to recent studies, the life expectancy of SCD patients&#x02019; has improved dramatically over the last century.<xref rid="bib0030" ref-type="bibr"><sup>6</sup></xref> However this longer life span has, as an unfortunate consequence, the development of progressive organ damage which includes osteoarticular lesions.<xref rid="bib0035" ref-type="bibr"><sup>7</sup></xref></p><p>Chronic pain is considered a serious public health problem which negatively affects the quality of life of individuals. Therefore, a multi-action therapeutic plan, specifically physiotherapy, could help decrease pain, and improve mobility and the rehabilitation of osteoarticular disorders, positively impacting on the quality of life.<xref rid="bib0040" ref-type="bibr"><sup>8</sup></xref></p><p>Despite this fact, there are few studies in the literature on the role of physiotherapy as a resource to prevent and treat locomotor system disorders in SCD patients. One study<xref rid="bib0045" ref-type="bibr"><sup>9</sup></xref> compared the efficacy of physiotherapy alone with physiotherapy associated with surgical femur decompression in SCD patients with osteonecrosis of the femoral head. The results showed no significant difference between these two approaches, suggesting that physical therapy alone appeared to be as effective as surgical decompression to improve hip function, thus deferring the need for surgery.</p><p>Within the existing physiotherapy resources, aquatic physiotherapy used in rehabilitation has demonstrated positive effects against pain, in regaining physical function and in improving quality of life in adults with musculoskeletal conditions.<xref rid="bib0050" ref-type="bibr"><sup>10</sup></xref> Movements performed in the water are facilitated by the elimination of the effects of gravity, resulting in increased muscle strength (MS) and flexibility. The benefits of water are mainly explained by the physiological effects of immersion and by the hydrodynamic principles of exercise, such as buoyancy, in this environment thereby enabling functional exercises with a reduced gravitational load. Furthermore, the immersion in thermo-neutral water (34&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C) in combination with the effects of hydrostatic pressure reduces the perception of pain. The physical properties and heated water play an important role in improving and maintaining the range of joint motions, reducing muscular tension and promoting relaxation, as well as preparing the muscle for stretching. The buoyancy induces muscle relaxation and the decrease in impact enables increased mobility and flexibility.<xref rid="bib0055 bib0060" ref-type="bibr"><sup>11,12</sup></xref></p><p>This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of aquatic and land-based physical therapy in decreasing hip and lower back musculoskeletal pain and increasing overall physical wellbeing in SCD patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec0010"><title>Methods</title><p>Adult SCD patients who regularly attended (at least three times a year during the previous three years) the Outpatient Clinic of the Hemocentro of the Universidade Estadual de Campinas (UNICAMP) with chronic hip and lumbar spine pain, and who had not participated in a physical therapy program during the previous 12 months, were invited to participate in this study. Patients with acute episodes, absence of over three physical therapy sessions without justification, or any dermatological issue which would prevent them from entering a therapeutic pool, were excluded from the study. The National Ethics Board approved this study, and all patients provided written informed consent.</p><sec id="sec0015"><title>Study design</title><p>Initially, the volunteers were evaluated according to functional scales, including the Lequesne's Algofunctional Questionnaire and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), range of motion (RoM) measurements of trunk flexion and extension, hip adduction and abduction, assessment of MS of the trunk flexors and extensors, and the flexors, extensors, adductors and abductors of the hip through load cell and surface electromyography (SEMG) of the iliocostalis, long dorsal (longissimus), gluteus maximus, gluteus medius and tensor fasciae latae muscles. Volunteers were then randomized by an investigator not involved in data collection, using the blind allocation method of sequentially numbered, opaque sealed envelopes,<xref rid="bib0065 bib0070" ref-type="bibr"><sup>13,14</sup></xref> into two different program groups: aquatic physiotherapy (AP) and conventional or land physiotherapy (CP). A total of 24 sessions over a twelve-week period (two sessions per week) were administered.

The load cell was connected to a Miotool 400<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> apparatus (MIOTEC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) using a SDS1000<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> sensor connected via a USB cable to a notebook. During movements, the force generated by traction on the load cell was transmitted to the Miograph<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software which produces a plot of MS in kilograms-force (kgf). Volunteers were submitted to isometric MS tests of the trunk flexors and extensors and hip flexors, extensors, adductors and abductors.</p></sec><sec id="sec0035"><title>Surface electromyography</title><p>Myoelectric signals of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, tensor fascia lata, long dorsal (longissimus) and iliocostalis muscles were sampled at 2000&#x000a0;Hz in single differential mode from each muscle through a four channel electromyography system (MIOTEC<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Porto Alegre, Brazil) using disposable Ag/AgCI circular bipolar electrodes (3M<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>). The 10&#x000a0;mm diameter electrodes with adhesive conducting gel were positioned on the skin overlying the muscles at an inter-electrode distance of 20&#x000a0;mm. Abrasion of the skin was achieved at the fixation sites with gauze soaked in alcohol to reduce impedance and the electrodes were then fixed at the muscular belly, distant from the motor point, and fixed with transparent tape and elastic band wrapping to avoid movement artifacts. The data acquisition Miograph USB<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> software system with windowing 32 (RMS &#x02013; Root Mean Square) and gain of 2000 for each channel was used to capture the electrical potentials of the muscles evaluated in microvolts (&#x003bc;V). Butterworth filters were used: order 4 and band pass 20&#x02013;500&#x000a0;Hz. The four channels were connected to active SDS500<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> sensors by clamps.

The dominant side of each patient was considered in the results.<xref rid="bib0075 bib0080" ref-type="bibr"><sup>15,16</sup></xref></p><p>The major limitation of this study was the recruitment of volunteers, as most of the patients live far from the center and find it very difficult to attend the clinic twice every week. Therefore, only ten patients, six compound heterozygous for Hb S and Hb C and four Hb S homozygotes, completed the physiotherapeutic program.</p><p>In view of the high frequency of avascular necrosis of the femoral head in SCD patients, the intervention was focused on the hip joint. The Lequesne questionnaire was used to evaluate the functionality of this joint. This scale assesses pain and hip function for daily activities. The results of the Lequesne Algofunctional questionnaire showed a statistically significant improvement after the intervention for both the groups. The AP group had very severe impairment (13.5 points) in the first assessment and moderate impairment (5.5 points) in the second. The CP group also had very severe impairment (11.5 points) in the first assessment and severe impairment (8 points) in the second. These results suggest that aquatic physiotherapy may lead to a greater improvement in hip functionality and are in agreement with Wang et al.<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> and Hinman et al.<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> who observed improvement in physical function after a program of aquatic physical therapy for patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis. Other studies carried out in individuals with hip and/or knee disorders however, showed no significant differences between the two rehabilitation strategies, suggesting that both techniques are equally effective.<xref rid="bib0110 bib0115 bib0120" ref-type="bibr"><sup>22&#x02013;24</sup></xref></p><p>Lower back pain is one of the main complaints of SCD patients. The ODI was herein used to assess lower back pain and function during daily activities. This index also showed statistically significant improvements in both study groups after the intervention. The CP group improved from moderate disability (26.5%) to minimal disability (18%); the AP group, however, despite some significant improvement in the scores of the second assessment (from 35% to 22%) showed no change in the severity of the disability caused by back pain. Longer or more frequent sessions may render better results, as has been described by others.<xref rid="bib0120 bib0125" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> These studies showed that patients who performed AP two or more times weekly had greater improvement in physical assessment scores than those who exercised only once a week.<xref rid="bib0120 bib0125" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,25</sup></xref> Nevertheless, Ariyoshi et al.<xref rid="bib0125" ref-type="bibr"><sup>25</sup></xref> extended the program for six months and concluded that water therapy exercises were useful for patients with back pain as they provide pain relief.</p><p>In this study, a significant improvement in RoM of the trunk extension and a trend toward an improvement in trunk flexion goniometry were observed in both groups, especially in the AP group. However, no significant change was detected in either group regarding motion amplitude, probably due to the inflammatory phenomena and bone infarctions which may have caused permanent limitations.</p><p>Furthermore, late interventions may not be sufficient to improve joint RoM in this age group in which chronic degenerative hip injuries may have reached a level of severity that precludes greater joint flexibility.</p><p>Moreover, the fact that there was no significant improvement in goniometry may be a consequence of the techniques used in both groups which may favor strength gain. Thus, perhaps the program should increase the time devoted to stretching certain target muscles during therapy, thereby promoting improved muscle flexibility.</p><p>Regarding trunk MS, a significant improvement in flexion was observed in both groups after the interventions. Despite the trend toward improvement in trunk extensor MS in the AP group, there were no significant differences between the two groups. These results are in agreement with other studies that showed improved MS after specific land-based and water-based trunk exercises.<xref rid="bib0120 bib0130 bib0135" ref-type="bibr"><sup>24,26,27</sup></xref></p><p>There was a statistically significant increase in hip extension and abduction MS in both groups after the interventions. Although, hip flexion MS was unchanged in the CP group, there was a trend toward improvement in the AP group, and hip adduction MS showed a slight trend toward improvement in both groups.</p><p>Thus, albeit slight, the results of this study showed improvement of all MS variables in the AP group, in accordance with Wang et al.<xref rid="bib0100" ref-type="bibr"><sup>20</sup></xref> who also observed improved flexibility and lower limb strength after 12 weeks of aquatic therapy, and Cochrane et al.<xref rid="bib0140" ref-type="bibr"><sup>28</sup></xref> who observed significant improvement in pain and physical function after aquatic exercises in adults with hip and knee osteoarthritis. In another study, Rahmann<xref rid="bib0145" ref-type="bibr"><sup>29</sup></xref> demonstrated a positive effect of a specific program of aquatic physical therapy on early recovery of strength after hip and knee surgeries. Furthermore, Hinman et al.<xref rid="bib0105" ref-type="bibr"><sup>21</sup></xref> observed a slight improvement in pain, physical function, quality of life and MS after aquatic therapy for patients with hip and knee osteoarthritis in a protocol of two sessions per week for six weeks. However, Jigami<xref rid="bib0115" ref-type="bibr"><sup>23</sup></xref> concluded that both programs, land-based and water-based, even when the exercises were performed only once a week, improved overall physical activity and MS in the lower limbs of osteoarthritis patients.</p><p>Surface electromyography did not show any significant difference after the interventions of both groups. However, there seemed to be an improvement in the electromyography signal of all muscles evaluated in the AP group. The better result obtained in this group may be related to the greater amount of muscle fibers recruited in aquatic therapy added to the physical properties of water such as buoyancy and multidirectional strength. These findings are in agreement with the results reported by Kaneda et al.<xref rid="bib0150" ref-type="bibr"><sup>30</sup></xref> who observed greater electromyography activity of all muscle movements performed in the water with floating devices.</p><p>The results of this study should be analyzed with caution as the sample size may have been a limiting factor and therefore, further studies are needed to confirm these results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec0065"><title>Conclusion</title><p>The results obtained here suggest that physical therapy is a resource capable of treating musculoskeletal dysfunction in SCD patients regardless of the technique used. However, exercises designed to stretch tone and strengthen the core and limb muscles carried out in the water require greater stabilization of the muscles and may justify the trend toward the better results obtained.</p></sec><sec id="sec0070"><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by the <funding-source id="gs0005">Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Cient&#x000ed;fico e Tecnol&#x000f3;gico</funding-source> (CNPq), and Funda&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de <funding-source id="gs0010">Coordena&#x000e7;&#x000e3;o de Aperfei&#x000e7;oamento de Pessoal de N&#x000ed;vel Superior</funding-source> (CAPES).
