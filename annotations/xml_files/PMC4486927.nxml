We evaluated the efficacy of extended 48-week regimen and the role of interleukin-28B (IL-28B) genotype in this clinical setting.

Although patients with RBV cumulative exposure &#x0003c;60% had lower SVR rates than those with RBV cumulative exposure &#x02265;60%, 48-week treatment provided greater SVR rates than 24-week treatment regardless of the grades of RBV cumulative exposure. Our findings were in line with the N-CORE study that RBV dosage and treatment duration may improve the SVR rates in HCV-2 patients not achieving RVR by reducing the relapse rates, especially for those receiving weight-based RBV for 48 weeks<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>.</p><p>We further analyzed if any pre-specified patient characteristics could help the health-care providers determine the optimized treatment strategies in HCV-2 patients not achieving RVR. In patients with favorable IL-28B genotype, the SVR rate of 48-week treatment was not superior to 24-week treatment. In contrast, extending the treatment duration to 48 weeks provided a superior SVR rate to standard 24 weeks of treatment if patients had unfavorable IL-28B genotypes.

However, Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>. showed that regardless of treatment duration, the IL-28B genotypes did not affect the SVR rates in these patients. The discrepancy of the results may be reasoned by the design of the studies. Whereas we randomized 187 patients as an 1:1 ratio to maximize the power of the study, Yamaguchi <italic>et al</italic>. allowed 59 patients 24 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) or 48 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;19) weeks of treatment on patients&#x02019; preference, which might introduce selection bias and result in insufficient power to discriminate the effects of extended duration of therapy<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.</p><p>In Asian HCV-2 patients where the prevalence rate of favorable IL-28B genotype is high, 24-week treatment would be sufficient to provide an overall SVR rate of 58.3% for these patients<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. In HCV-2 patients of non-Asian ancestry where the prevalence rate of favorable IL-28B genotype is relatively low, the patients may extend the treatment duration to 48 weeks to secure the high SVR rate (73.9%) or may switch to sofosbuvir-based therapies if they were intolerable or unwilling to receiving continuous Peg-IFN plus RBV therapy in countries where sofosbuvir is available<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>.</p><p>The EASL clinical practice guideline and the expert&#x02019;s opinions recommended that HCV-2 patients with cirrhosis and with BMI &#x0003e;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> should receive 24&#x02013;48 weeks of Peg-IFN plus RBV regardless of RVR<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b28">28</xref>.

However, the distributions of IL-28B genotypes between the two treatment arms were similar, which minimized the potential errors of our findings.
