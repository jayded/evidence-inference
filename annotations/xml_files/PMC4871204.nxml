ABO incompatible living donor renal transplants are not permitted by the Chinese government. The drug regimen used for such renal transplants is a three-drug combination therapy consisting of tacrolimus as the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) as the immunosuppressive drug, and corticosteroids. Tacrolimus is an effective drug widely used for the suppression of acute rejection in renal transplantation in China. However, as a CNI, its typical adverse effects include hypertension, hyperglycemia, and nephrotoxicity, with renal damage being an adverse effect that requires particular attention.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="bibr2-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr3-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr4-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup></p><p>MMF is an immunosuppressive drug widely used in China that is effective for the suppression of renal transplant rejection.

We believe that renal function improved in the study group because of the lower dose (trough level) of tacrolimus in the study group compared to the control group.</p><p>CNIs are powerful immunosuppressants, and adequate suppression of T-cell function definitely plays an important role in the suppression of acute rejection. However, it is well known that CNIs trigger renal damage.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="bibr3-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr4-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The chronic nephrotoxicity of CNIs (CNI toxicity) is considered to be one of the reasons why mid- and long-term survival rates are not improving, and protocols based on CNI avoidance or withdrawal have been considered.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="bibr20-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr21-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> Various protocols based on CNI reduction have been explored, and there has been a report where at 12&#x02009;months post-transplantation the estimated GFR was higher and the occurrence of acute rejection was lower with low-dose tacrolimus than with standard-dose cyclosporine.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> On the other hand, there is a report that CNI toxicity and the development of interstitial fibrosis (IF) and tubular atrophy (TA) without any specific etiology correlate.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> Outside of CNI dosing, acute rejection appears to play a strong role in the development of IF/TA in that if acute rejection occurs within 1&#x02009;year from renal transplantation, the rate of IF/TA presentation increases significantly at 2&#x02009;years after transplantation.<sup><xref rid="bibr24-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></sup> This suggests that suppressing rejection itself is an important factor in reducing the development of IF/TA. Our results showed that a CNI dose reduction protocol may be able to prevent progress to IF/TA due to CNI nephrotoxicity better than the control group. Moreover, the fact that graft rejection was favorably suppressed in this study during the first year raises the possibility that the development of IF/TA can be halted through the suppression of rejection.</p><p>A lower incidence of CMV infection in the study group was observed when the incidence rates of adverse effects were compared, but there was no significant difference between the two groups. In China, CMV prophylactic therapy has been widely used since 2008 for CMV infection prevention in at-risk renal transplant patients. However, while CMV prophylactic therapy can reduce the incidence rates of CMV infection when compared with preemptive therapy, it is now well-recognized that late-onset CMV infection can develop when the administration of ganciclovir is ceased.<sup><xref rid="bibr25-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr26-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></sup> In this study, we expected the incidence of CMV infection in the two groups to be similar since the same prophylactic antiviral therapy was administered in both groups. However, we did note a CMV infection incidence rate that was slightly higher in the control group, though insignificantly, than in the study group (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.112).

The incidence rate, however, of diarrhea in the control group was 17.9% and lower than the previous MMF reports that were used to determine the sample size of this study. The lower incidence rate may have been due to insufficient questioning by study investigators or patients may have had a lower level of awareness regarding any manifestation of diarrhea. Furthermore, the incidence rates of diarrhea reported with MMF may have been increased due to the use of questionnaires like the Gastrointestinal Symptom Rating Scale (GSRS).<sup><xref rid="bibr28-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Diarrhea not only lowers the quality of life of transplant patients, but it can also decrease the absorption of immunosuppressive drugs from the digestive tract and possibly trigger graft rejection, and its prevention is therefore important. The development of diarrhea is a well-known and important adverse effect of MMF and has been reported to occur at a higher incidence than with MZR.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> In our study, serious gastrointestinal bleeding occurred in one patient in the control group.

Since hyperuricemia may be a cause of renal damage, lower the survival rate of the kidney, and be a cause of CNI toxicity and the development of IF/TA, attention is required. It has been reported that the incidence of hyperuricemia is higher with MZR than with MMF.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr27-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup> Similar results were observed in this study with a slightly higher incidence of hyperuricemia in the study group. However, there are also reports that there is no difference in the incidence of hyperuricemia between MZR and MMF.<sup><xref rid="bibr29-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="bibr30-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">30</xref></sup> With respect to degree of hyperuricemia, one patient in the study group had a serum uric acid level of 783&#x02009;&#x000b5;moL/L, but the serum uric acid levels of this patient were elevated prior to transplantation and further increased up to the fourth day post-transplantation. Thus, the serum uric acid levels of this patient may have increased due to unstable renal function.</p><p>The mechanism of action of MZR is similar to MMF in that it inhibits DNA synthesis by selectively inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase in the de novo pathway.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="bibr11-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr12-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="bibr31-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="bibr32-2050312116643672" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></sup> However, why the incidence of hyperuricemia is higher with MZR than MMF is largely unknown. Unlike MMF, MZR is excreted in urine and this difference in excretion mechanism gives rise to hyperuricemia, but since gradual lowering of uric acid can be managed through the concomitant use of sodium hydrogen carbonate and allopurinol, adequate management is therefore considered to be possible.</p><p>This study had a number of limitations. First, this study was an open-label study subject to bias since patients could elect to withhold consent if allocated to the study group. As described earlier, only patients allocated to the study group withheld consent due to concerns over the study group regimen. Second, as this study was conducted at a single hospital in a mid-sized city in Central China, bias may be present in patient characteristics. Third, the study sample size was small, and the study duration was short. Due to these limitations, further long-term studies with longer follow-up periods and larger numbers of patients drawn from a more diverse patient population are needed to assess any long-term benefits of the study group regimen to transplant patients.</p><p>In conclusion, the four-drug combination therapy (study group) tested in this study reduced nephrotoxicity using a lower CNI dose and suppressed acute graft rejection as well as the control group. Furthermore, since gastrointestinal disorders due to MMF could also be reduced, the study group regimen can be considered a recommended protocol. Moreover, in China, we reduce the amount of drugs used and focus on preventing the occurrence of adverse effects because the physique of Chinese patients is comparatively smaller than Europeans and Americans. Given the foregoing, the study group regimen could at least be satisfactorily adopted for use in China.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Declaration of conflicting interests:</bold> The author(s) declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Ethics approval:</bold> Ethical approval for this study was obtained from the 2011 Henan Provincial People&#x02019;s Hospital Institutional Review Board (Approval No. 19).</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding:</bold> The author(s) received no financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Informed consent:</bold> Written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before the study.</p></fn><fn fn-type="other"><p><bold>Trial registration:</bold> Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, Trial Registration Number: ChiCTR-ICQ-15007131 located at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chictr.org.cn">http://www.chictr.org.cn</ext-link></p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bibr1-2050312116643672"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
