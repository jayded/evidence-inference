Thus, in addition to the ambiguity regarding the effects of brief weight loss interventions on bone, the long-term consequences of weight loss on bone mass, bone turnover, and subsequent fracture remain relatively unknown.

We hypothesized that partial weight regain would not restore BMD or bone turnover markers to pre-weight reduction values.

Subsequently, the food records were analyzed for nutrient content using Food Processor 8.0 computer program (esha, Salem, OR). Exercise training was performed in the Exercise Physiology Lab and was monitored by study personnel.

Body weight was measured weekly on a Toledo scale (Mettler-Toledo Inc., Columbus, OH) for the duration of the study and was used to calculate body mass index (BMI). Skinfold thickness was measured at three sites (triceps, suprailiac, and midthigh) with skinfold calipers. Three measurements were taken at each site and the mean of the two closest measurements was used to calculate percent body fat according to the Jackson-Pollock equation (<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">Jackson 1985</xref>). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA, Hologic QDR 4500, Waltham, MA), which became available mid-study, was used to measure bone area, BMC, and areal BMD in a subset of the participants (weight loss: n=24; weight regain: EX, n=14; NOEX, n=10). This subset of participants did not differ from the rest of the study population in age, initial body weight, BMI, percent body fat, maximal oxygen consumption, nor in percent weight lost or gained (data not shown). Scans of the total body, lumbar spine (L1&#x02013;L4), and total hip were performed. Areal BMD (g/cm<sup>2</sup>) was calculated from bone area (cm<sup>2</sup>) and BMC (g) by the software supplied with the DXA scanner (version 12.4).

Blood collection was preceded by 48 hours of dietary control and no exercise in the early morning following an overnight, 12-hr fast to reduce the variation associated with circadian rhythms and feeding. Likewise, for each participant, blood samples were collected during the same phase of the menstrual cycle, to minimize intra-individual variation associated with menstrual-cycle phase. Menstrual cycle regularity was not altered by weight loss. A portion of each blood sample was dispensed into a 10-ml Serum Separator Tube&#x02122; (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ USA) followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 2000g. The separated serum was transferred to cryogenic vials and stored at &#x02212;70 &#x000b0;C for later analysis.</p><p id="P16">Serum markers of bone formation and resorption are used clinically as indirect measures of bone remodeling (<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">Seibel 2005</xref>). Osteocalcin (OC) is secreted by mature osteoblasts, while bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BAP) is secreted by newly differentiated osteoblasts (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Aubin et al. 1995</xref>). C-terminal telopeptide of type I collagen (CTX) is released when bone collagen is broken down during bone resorption. The concentrations of OC, BAP, and CTX in serum were assessed in duplicate using commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (Osteocalcin and Metra<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> BAP, Quidel, San Diego CA; Serum CrossLaps<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Immunodiagnostic Systems, Fountain Hills, AZ). We measured CTX in serum rather than urine to minimize intra-individual variation (<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">Christgau et al. 2000</xref>). The anti-OC antibody used in the ELISA recognizes only intact OC; therefore, because the antibody does not bind OC fragments, which are released during bone resorption, OC measured using this ELISA results only from de novo synthesis. All assays were performed in the same run to eliminate inter-assay variability. Coefficients of variation for the OC, BAP and CTX assays were &#x0003c;10%.</p></sec></sec><sec id="S16"><title>Statistics</title><p id="P17">To examine the effects of weight loss, a repeated measures 1-factor analysis of variance (RMANOVA) was used to test for a significant main effect of time (baseline vs. post weight loss). The main effects and interaction of partial weight regain and exercise during weight regain were examined using a 2-factor (time and exercise treatment) RMANOVA. In the case of a significant interaction, follow-up paired t-tests were used to test differences from post-weight loss to post-weight regain within each group. Pearson&#x02019;s correlation was used to examine bivariate relationships between absolute and percent changes in the bone turnover markers during weight loss and partial regain. The normality assumption was verified using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data are means &#x000b1; standard error of the mean (SEM).

Weight regain had no effect on bone area of the total body (Post-weight loss = 1979 &#x000b1; 34 cm<sup>2</sup>; Post-weight regain= 1967 &#x000b1; 35 cm<sup>2</sup>), lumbar spine (Post-weight loss = 57.5 &#x000b1; 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>; Post-weight regain= 57.5 &#x000b1; 1.5 cm<sup>2</sup>) or total hip (Post-weight loss = 31.3 &#x000b1; 0.8 cm<sup>2</sup>; Post-weight regain= 31.1 &#x000b1; 0.7 cm<sup>2</sup>).</p><p id="P24">Likewise, weight regain had no effect on serum markers of bone turnover. OC and CTX remained elevated relative to baseline following weight regain (44 &#x000b1; 12% and 23 &#x000b1; 7%, respectively) and did not differ from post-weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>). Exercise during weight regain had no effect on the bone turnover markers, although the interaction between exercise and time for CTX approached statistical significance (p=0.06).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="S20"><title>Discussion</title><p id="P25">In the present study, we observed a statistically significant reduction in lumbar spine and hip BMD after moderate weight loss in overweight or obese, middle-aged women with a concurrent increase in serum markers of bone formation and breakdown. This study, which is the first to examine changes in bone mass and turnover during carefully controlled weight regain, found that weight-loss-induced perturbations in bone mass and turnover persisted after partial weight regain, regardless of whether regular, weight-bearing aerobic exercise was continued. However, it is important to note that continuation of aerobic exercise countered the detrimental effects of partial weight regain on many markers of the metabolic syndrome, as previously reported (<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">Thomas et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p id="P26">There is considerable evidence from relatively short-term weight loss intervention studies, which are typically 3&#x02013;6 months long, that weight reduction, through energy restriction alone or combined with exercise, results in loss of total body or regional BMD (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Avenell et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">Pritchard et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R53" ref-type="bibr">Van Loan et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Fogelholm et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">Riedt et al. 2005</xref>; <xref rid="R54" ref-type="bibr">Villareal et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Villareal et al. 2008</xref>) and accelerated bone turnover (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Salamone et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R55" ref-type="bibr">Villareal et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">Holecki et al. 2007</xref>). By contrast, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Bosy-Westphal et al. (2011)</xref> reported significant increases in leg, lumbar spine and total body BMD following weight loss in overweight or obese men and women, some of which were fully or partially reversed with subsequent weight regain. However, results from other studies that included a post-weight loss follow-up suggest that alterations in BMD and bone turnover may persist during weight maintenance (<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">Avenell et al. 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">Fogelholm et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R56" ref-type="bibr">Villareal et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hinton et al. 2009</xref>). The present study extends these findings to partial weight regain following moderate weight loss in overweight or obese women, regardless of activity status. The persistent reduction in BMD and sustained elevation in bone turnover markers following a cycle weight loss and partial regain have clinical relevance, as both are independent predictors of fracture risk (<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">Garnero and Delmas 2004</xref>).</p><p id="P27">Because of the reported benefits of weight-bearing physical activity on maintenance of bone mass and strength in weight-stable premenopausal women (<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">Eickhoff et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">Bassey and Ramsdale 1994</xref>; <xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Borer 2005</xref>), we examined the possibility that continuation of regular weight-bearing aerobic exercise would affect BMD and bone turnover during weight regain. While the ability of exercise to &#x0201c;protect&#x0201d; bone against the deleterious effects of weight loss has been examined previously with mixed results (<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">Andersen et al. 1997</xref>; <xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">Salamone et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">Nakata et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Rector et al. 2009</xref>), the present study is the first to examine the use of weight-bearing exercise as a means to enhance &#x0201c;recovery&#x0201d; of bone mass and turnover following weight loss. We hypothesized that exercise during partial weight regain would increase BMD and alter the bone turnover markers in favor of bone formation, i.e., greater reductions in CTX and greater increases in OC and BAP. However, we found that exercise did not enhance recovery of BMD during weight regain, and, in fact, was associated with a significant decrease in total body BMD. Likewise, exercise did not affect serum markers of bone turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). There are several biologically plausible reasons that exercise during weight regain appeared to have no effect on BMD or bone turnover markers.</p><p id="P28">According to Frost&#x02019;s mechanostat theory (<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">Frost 1997</xref>), for an activity to be osteogenic, the strain of the mechanical load must exceed a certain strain intensity or threshold. The participants in the present study were previously untrained and, for many, the target exercise intensity (60% of VO<sub>2 peak</sub>) was achieved by fast treadmill walking on an incline. Although walking is a weight-bearing activity, it produces ground reaction forces only equal to, or slightly greater than, body weight (<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">Nilsson and Thorstensson 1989</xref>). Therefore, a plausible explanation for the negative findings in the present study is that the exercise stimulus was insufficient to induce bone formation. These findings are also consistent with those of previous interventions that also reported no effect of walking on BMD in women during weight maintenance (<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">Nelson et al. 1991</xref>; <xref rid="R58" ref-type="bibr">Wu et al. 2006</xref>) or weight loss (<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Rector et al. 2009</xref>). Thus, it appears that low-impact aerobic exercise may be ineffective in increasing bone mass and normalizing bone turnover markers during partial weight regain in premenopausal women. Moreover, the absence of an increase in BMD during weight regain with or without exercise suggests that recovery of the bone lost during weight reduction is difficult to achieve.</p><p id="P29">It is important to recognize that calcium and vitamin D status might moderate the effects of weight loss or regain on bone turnover and BMD. In the present study, mean intakes of both calcium and vitamin D during weight loss were less than the Adequate Intake, and, although, calcium intake increased during weight regain, 73% of participants consumed less than 1000 mg Ca/d. Sufficient dietary calcium and vitamin D are especially important under conditions of reduced calcium absorption (<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">Borer 2005</xref>), such as occurs with weight loss (<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">Cifuentes et al. 2004</xref>). High dietary calcium (1.5&#x02013;1.8 g Ca/d) preserves bone mass and turnover during weight loss in premenopausal women (<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">Ricci et al. 1998</xref>; <xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">Jensen et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">Shapses et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Riedt et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="R57" ref-type="bibr">Wagner et al. 2007</xref>), possibly by preventing increased secretion of the pro-resorptive parathyroid hormone (<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">Riedt et al. 2007</xref>). Thus, low dietary calcium and vitamin D might have contributed to the decrease in BMD observed following weight reduction in the present study.</p><p id="P30">Although there is evidence that high dietary calcium can mitigate some of the deleterious effects of weight loss on bone, the skeletal effects of dietary calcium post-weight loss are unclear. We previously reported no differences between a recommended- and low-dairy weight-maintenance diet, containing ~600 vs. ~1300 mg Ca/d, on total body BMD following weight reduction in obese women (<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">Hinton et al. 2010</xref>). By contrast, <xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Thorpe et al. (2008)</xref> reported that a high-protein diet (1000 mg Ca/d) positively affected total body BMD during weight stabilization compared with a high-carbohydrate diet (700 mg Ca/d) in overweight men and women (<xref rid="R47" ref-type="bibr">Thorpe et al. 2008</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, no studies have examined the skeletal effects of dietary calcium during weight regain.</p><p id="P31">Consistent with the results of the present study, we have repeatedly observed that CTX and OC, but not BAP, increase with weight reduction (<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">Hinton et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">Rector et al. 2009</xref>). It is unclear if the discrepant response between BAP and OC is due to their differential expression during osteoblast maturation (<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">Aubin et al. 1995</xref>), or to a possible glucoregulatory endocrine function of OC. Recent evidence in genetically altered mice indicates that osteoblasts secrete OC, which improves insulin sensitivity in liver, adipose, and skeletal muscle (<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">Lee et al. 2007</xref>). In obese humans, OC increases with weight loss concurrent with improved insulin sensitivity (<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">Fernandez-Real et al. 2009</xref>). Therefore, the increase in OC observed in the present study may reflect an osteoblast endocrine function that is unrelated to bone formation. These possibilities are intriguing and warrant future investigation.</p><p id="P32">The present study has several strengths. First, both the prescribed weight loss and prescribed weight regain were carefully controlled through regular monitoring of body weight and energy intake. Similarly, all exercise training sessions were monitored by study personnel. A second strength of the present study is that we measured changes in bone area during weight loss and regain. In adults, BMD and BMC should change in parallel, as bone area does not change appreciably; thus, discordant BMD and BMC results are biologically implausible and are probably artifacts of DXA. This issue is particularly problematic for evaluation of changes in BMD associated with alteration in body mass or composition (<xref rid="R49" ref-type="bibr">Tothill et al. 1999</xref>; <xref rid="R48" ref-type="bibr">Tothill 2005</xref>). For example, <xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">Bosy-Westphal et al. (2011)</xref> demonstrated that weight-loss-associated changes in arm, leg, lumbar spine and pelvis BMD were negatively correlated with changes in bone area, but not BMC. Thus, because bone area did not change with weight loss or partial regain, we verified that the alterations in BMD were likely not the result of artifactual changes in bone area.</p><p id="P33">Regarding study limitations, it is important to note that the sample size affected the statistical power for the outcome variables, indicating an increased likelihood of Type II errors, i.e., failure to reject the null hypothesis that exercise had no effect, when in fact it is false. Another limitation, which is not unique to our study, is the necessity of using indirect measures, i.e., serum markers, of bone formation and bone breakdown that reflect the entire skeletal response and are not site-specific. Finally, we did not control calcium and vitamin D intake during weight loss and regain, which might be viewed as a strength or a limitation. Because we did not control calcium and vitamin D intake, we cannot assess the independent effects of changes in energy balance. However, because calcium and vitamin D intakes are often reduced during energy-restriction (<xref rid="R50" ref-type="bibr">Truby et al. 2008</xref>) and the prevalence of inadequacy is high among dieting individuals (<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">Ashley et al. 2007</xref>), our study design more accurately reflects dieting in the &#x0201c;real world.&#x0201d; Finally, future studies that aim to examine the protective and restorative effects of exercise should test exercise interventions that are specifically designed to have maximal osteogenic effect, i.e., &#x0003c;100 loading cycles per session of high-impact, dynamic, multi-directional activity (<xref rid="R51" ref-type="bibr">Turner and Robling 2005</xref>).</p><p id="P34">In summary, the results of the present study, which is the first to examine changes in bone mass and turnover during carefully controlled weight regain, suggest that weight-loss-induced perturbations in bone mass and turnover persisted after partial weight regain, regardless of whether regular, weight-bearing aerobic exercise was continued. The persistent reduction in BMD and sustained elevation in bone turnover markers following weight loss have clinical relevance, as both are independent predictors of fracture
