The causes of pathologic mechanism underlying fibromyalgia are unknown, but fibromyalgia may lead to reduced quality of life. The objective of this study was to analyze the repercussions of craniosacral therapy on depression, anxiety and quality of life in fibromyalgia patients with painful symptoms. An experimental, double-blind longitudinal clinical trial design was undertaken. Eighty-four patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia were randomly assigned to an intervention group (craniosacral therapy) or placebo group (simulated treatment with disconnected ultrasound). The treatment period was 25 weeks. Anxiety, pain, sleep quality, depression and quality of life were determined at baseline and at 10 minutes, 6 months and 1-year post-treatment. State anxiety and trait anxiety, pain, quality of life and Pittsburgh sleep quality index were significantly higher in the intervention versus placebo group after the treatment period and at the 6-month follow-up. However, at the 1-year follow-up, the groups only differed in the Pittsburgh sleep quality index. Approaching fibromyalgia by means of craniosacral therapy contributes to improving anxiety and quality of life levels in these patients.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>There is an increasing interest in the role of psychological factors in fibromyalgia, and studies have been published on associated psychological variables, psychopathological explanations, assessment instruments and psychological intervention programs [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Suhr (2003) considered psychological factors to be important for understanding the subjective and objective cognitive disorders of fibromyalgia patients [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Various investigations have centered on the relationship of fibromyalgia with pain, depression, anxiety and quality of life. The Copenhagen declaration in 1992 described psychological patterns frequently associated with fibromyalgia, such as anxiety and depression, and there is a growing interest in this aspect among professionals of different fields [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, many authors consider that psychological factors are more frequently the result than the cause of pain and disability in fibromyalgia, and this issue remains controversial [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>].</p><p>Some symptoms of fibromyalgia are similar to those observed during depression, and antidepressants have been administered to fibromyalgia patients to treat sleep disorders and pain symptoms [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Review of the literature on the association between fibromyalgia and depression reveals two divergent research lines. Hudson and others [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] believe that a direct association cannot be established between fibromyalgia and depression, whereas Gruber and others (1996) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] propose a common etiology for fibromyalgia and depression. Significant differences in psychological state between patients with fibromyalgia and depression were reported in a study on fibromyalgia, pain intensity and duration and psychological alterations; the results of depression and anxiety questionnaires indicated that the somatic expression of depression differed between the two patient groups [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. The relationship between depression and fibromyalgia remains controversial. Although antidepressants can reduce pain and fatigue in fibromyalgia, the effects of these drugs vary in degree and duration among patients [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Various authors have indicated that patients with fibromyalgia are more depressed than healthy controls and that their perception of psychological distress or depression is similar to that of depressed patients [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Moreover, levels of psychological distress (depression, anxiety) have been correlated with cognitive findings in both groups of patients (fibromyalgia and depression) [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>Garland [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] observed a higher degree of anxiety in fibromyalgia patients than in healthy controls or other groups of patients with painful disease, for example, rheumatoid arthritis. Anxious individuals usually have a respiratory dysfunction that generates more work in the upper chest, and the resulting minimum diaphragmatic activity may exacerbate symptoms in patients with fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndromes. Although anxiety is known to be an immediate symptom of hyperventilation, it is controversial whether or not hyperventilation and anxiety in patients with fibromyalgia result from a broader alteration. In this context, Peter et al. [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] reported that education to reduce the effects of hyperventilation can reduce fibromyalgia symptoms, including pain, fatigue and emotional distress.</p><p>Dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system may explain the different clinical manifestations of fibromyalgia. The hyperactive sympathetic nervous system of these patients becomes incapable of responding to different stressing stimuli, which would explain the continuous tiredness and the morning rigidity of these patients [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Likewise, incessant sympathetic activity may explain the sleeping disorders, anxiety, pseudo Raynaud's phenomenon, dry syndrome and intestinal irritability [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The other defining characteristics of fibromyalgia such as diffuse pain, painful sensitivity to palpation and paresthesia may also be explained by &#x0201c;sympathetically maintained pain". This neuropathic pain is characterized by a perception of pain regardless of the presence of stimuli, accompanied by paresthesias and allodynia, which are characteristic of patients with fibromyalgia [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Patients frequently report sleeping disorders as well as depression, and both factors are known to have a strong association with cognitive disruption [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] and to play an important role in the reduced quality of life reported by fibromyalgia patients. There is a high prevalence of sleeping problems in this population. In many cases, pain and fatigue disappear with sleep. However, paradoxically, patients with fibromyalgia awake with intensified muscle rigidity, pain and marked fatigue [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Shaver et al. [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] described a vicious circle of pain, poor sleep, fatigue and increased pain in overt fibromyalgia. Bigatti et al. [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] concluded that sleep predicts subsequent pain in these patients but may be related to depression due to pain and physical dysfunction.</p><p>The quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia is especially impaired in relation to physical function, intellectual activity and emotional state, influencing their working capacity and social relationships [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. Backman [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] affirmed that psychosocial factors are related to two dimensions of experience: psychological (cognitive, affective) and social (interacting with others, performing daily activities). According to this author, psychosocial factors influence the perception of pain, which in turn influences psychological wellbeing and social participation.</p><p>Various studies have demonstrated the efficacy of biofeedback acupuncture to reduce pain symptoms in fibromyalgia [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, we could find no studies that address the effects of manual therapy on the autonomic nervous system or the possible benefit of this type of alternative therapies as a complement to pharmaceutical treatment of hyperautonomic alterations and derived disorders (anxiety and depression). With this background, the objective of this study was to determine the effects of craniosacral therapy on anxiety, depression, pain, sleep quality and quality of life in fibromyalgia patients up to 1-year post-treatment.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Setting and Participants</title><p>Patients with fibromyalgia syndrome undergoing pharmaceutical therapy were recruited from among members of the Almeria Fibromyalgia Association with clinical records at the Torrec&#x000e1;rdenas Hospital Complex (Almeria, Spain). Inclusion criteria were: diagnosis of fibromyalgia (by rheumatology specialist), age of 16&#x02013;65 years and agreement to attend afternoon therapy sessions. Exclusion criteria were: presence of physical disease, psychological disease, infection, fever, hypotension or skin disorders or respiratory alterations that would limit the application of the treatments.</p><p>Out of the 376 patients in the accessible population, 351 were subjected to a randomization procedure to recruit a sample of 119 patients. Out of these 119 patients, 15 were excluded, and the remaining 104 were randomly assigned by means of a balanced stratified assignment to an intervention (<italic>n</italic> = 52) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 52) group. The groups were balanced for type of medication received, sex and age, using a stratification system that generates a sequence of letters (from a table of correlatively ordered permutations) for each category and combination of categories. Informed consent was obtained from all participants according to the ethical criteria established in the Helsinki declaration, modified in 2000, for the performance of research projects. In Spain, current legislation for clinical trials is gathered in the Real Decreto 223/2004 February 6, 2004. This project was approved by the research commissions of the University of Almeria and of the Torrec&#x000e1;rdenas Hospital Complex (Almeria)-Servicio Andaluz de Salud (Andalusian Healthcare Service).</p><p>Twenty-one patients were under treatment with muscle relaxants, 32 with antidepressants, 46 with anxiolytics, 59 with anti-inflammatories, 36 with corticoids and 84 with analgesics.</p><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.1.1"><title>2.1.1.

Procedure</title><p>In this experimental, longitudinal double-blind clinical trial, the intervention group was formed by 43 patients and the placebo group by 41. Before the treatments, initial assessments of anxiety, depression, pain, sleep and quality of life were performed in all patients [<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Women of childbearing age were assessed the day after their menstrual period ended. These assessments were repeated at 30 min, six months and 1 year after the last session of the 25-week treatment program.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. Intervention</title><p>The intervention group underwent a craniosacral therapy protocol, with two weekly sessions of 1&#x02009;h for 25 weeks. The treatment was carried out by an expert craniosacral therapist with the patient in prone position. This therapy consists of applying very mild manual traction on cranial bones in flexion or extension stages of the craniosacral cycle. The aims were to contribute to re-establishing the normal movement of cranial bones and to intervene in the autonomic nervous system by releasing bone and membranous restrictions [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Craniosacral therapy procedures were: still point (occipital), compression-decompression of temporomandibular joint, decompression of temporal fascia, compression-decompression of sphenobasilar joint, parietal lift, frontal lift, scapular waist release and pelvic diaphragm release [<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>].</p><p>The placebo group underwent two weekly 30-min sessions of sham ultrasound treatment in which the disconnected probe (4 cm in diameter) was applied to the cervical area (10 min), lumbar region (10 min) and both sides of the knees (10 min). The sham treatment was performed with the patient in prone position. The screen of the ultrasound was covered to ensure that the patient was unaware that the equipment was disconnected.</p><p>Both patient groups were instructed not to change their pharmacological treatment during the 25-week study period.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Statistical Analysis</title><p>The SPSS package (version 17.0) was used for the data analyses. After performing descriptive statistics of variables at baseline, the Kolmogorov&#x02013;Smirnof test was applied to evaluate the normal distribution of variables. Continuous data were expressed as means &#x000b1; SD. A paired <italic>t</italic>-test was used to examine changes in scores between baseline and follow-up examinations. Inter-group differences in variables were analyzed by using repeated-measures analysis of variance. Relationships between demographic variables (sex and age group), aggravating factors, work activity, diseases related to fibromyalgia syndrome, VAS pain score, dimensions of the SF-36 health survey for quality of life, dimensions of the Pittsburgh sleep quality index, total Beck depression inventory score and state and trait anxiety scores were evaluated by calculating Pearson correlation coefficients. A 95% confidence interval (CI) (<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> = 0.05) was considered in all tests.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec3"><title>3. Results</title><p>During the study, 9 patients withdrew from the intervention group and 11 from the placebo group. Reasons for withdrawal were death of spouse, start of another type of treatment, change in pharmacologic therapy during treatment period, and missing sessions due to acute pain crisis and forgetfulness.

Likewise, the improvement obtained in the majority of SF-36 dimensions was similar to that achieved after a 3-month hydrotherapy program, which obtained a 40% reduction in the &#x0201c;body pain" dimension, although the mechanisms underlying this improvement have not been elucidated [<xref rid="B55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>, <xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>].</p><p>The improvement in the SF-36 questionnaire of quality of life shown by intervention group patients was lesser than their improvement in VAS score. This may be explained by the greater sensitivity of the &#x0201c;body pain" dimension of the SF-36 to detect painful changes in comparison to the VAS. Redondo et al. [<xref rid="B56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] also reported significant differences in the results obtained by these two measures of body pain.</p><p>At the end of the treatment period, the intervention and placebo groups differed significantly in overall Pittsburgh subjective sleep quality index score and in habitual sleep efficiency and sleep disturbance items. However, at one month after therapeutic intervention, significant differences were also found in sleep latency and duration. These results are in agreement with those published by Hains and Hains [<xref rid="B57" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], who also found significant differences in sleep quality at one month after a spinal compression and manipulation protocol despite finding no changes in fatigue or pain immediately after the treatment. An improvement in sleep quality persisted for 1 year after a 20-session course of manual therapy involving conjunctive tissue manipulation [<xref rid="B58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The release of fascial restrictions may improve sleep quality by correcting visceral fascial dysfunction and thereby favoring the secretion of platelet serotonin. A study of the gut neurological system found that a high proportion of fibromyalgia patients had intestinal disorders, probably due to neuro-endocrinal causes, which may affect serotonin secretion [<xref rid="B59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>].</p><p>Studies on the effects of aerobic exercise programs in fibromyalgia patients found no significant difference in the number of nights per week with sleep disturbances [<xref rid="B60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. However, multidisciplinary therapeutic programs were reported to significantly improve anxiety, depression, wellbeing and sleep quality [<xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>].</p><p>One of the limitations of the study was the inability to study 25 of the 376 patients in the accessible population before the randomized selection of the study group, due to incompatibility with their work schedules. A further limitation is related to the disparity between males and females diagnosed with fibromyalgia, which may be conditioned by the cultural setting. It is also possible that subjects with less severe pain were able to improve more rapidly.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>The present study shows that craniosacral therapy improves the quality of life of patients with fibromyalgia, reducing their perception of pain and fatigue and improving their night rest and mood, with an increase in physical function. Our craniosacral therapy protocol also reduces anxiety levels, partially improving the depressive state. This manual therapy modality must be considered as a complementary therapy within a multidisciplinary approach to these patients, also including pharmaceutical, physiotherapeutic, psychological and social treatments.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Merayo-Alonso</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Cano-Garc&#x000ed;a</surname><given-names>FJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Rodr&#x000ed;guez-Franco</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Ariza-Ariza</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Navarro-Sarabia</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Un acercamiento bibliom&#x000e9;trico a la investigaci&#x000f3;n en fibromialgia [A bibliometric approach to research into fibromyalgia]</article-title><source><italic>Reumatologia Clinica</italic></source><year>2007</year><volume>3</volume><issue>2</issue><fpage>55</fpage><lpage>62</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21794399</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tan</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Tillisch</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Functional somatic syndromes: emerging biomedical models and traditional Chinese medicine</article-title><source><italic>Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>1</volume><fpage>35</fpage><lpage>40</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15257324</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Suhr</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Neuropsychological impairment in fibromyalgia: relation to depression, fatigue, and pain</article-title><source><italic>Journal of Psychosomatic Research</italic></source><year>2003</year><volume>55</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>321</fpage><lpage>329</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14507543</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Macintyre</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Hume</surname><given-names>MC</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The chronic fatigue syndrome</article-title><source><italic>Postgraduate Medical Journal</italic></source><year>1993</year><volume>69</volume><issue>808</issue><fpage>p. 164</fpage></element-citation></ref><ref id="B5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Hudson</surname><given-names>JI</given-names></name><name><surname>Arnold</surname><given-names>LM</given-names></name><name><surname>Keck</surname><given-names>PE</given-names><suffix>Jr.</suffix></name><name><surname>Auchenbach</surname><given-names>MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Pope</surname><given-names>HG</given-names><suffix>Jr.</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>Family study of fibromyalgia and affective spectrum disorder</article-title><source><italic>Biological Psychiatry</italic></source><year>2004</year><volume>56</volume><issue>11</issue><fpage>884</fpage><lpage>891</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">15576066</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="B6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Hudson</surname><given-names>JI</given-names></name><name><surname>Pope</surname><given-names>HG</given-names><suffix>Jr.</suffix></name></person-group><article-title>The management of treatment-resistant depression in disorders on the interface of psychiatry and medicine:
