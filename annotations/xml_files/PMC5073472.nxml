However, use of LARCs in Australia is very low, despite clinical practice guidance and statements by national and international peak bodies advocating their increased use. This protocol paper describes the Australian Contraceptive ChOice pRojet (ACCORd), a cluster randomised control trial that aims to test whether an educational intervention targeting general practitioners (GPs) and establishing a rapid referral service are a cost-effective means of increasing LARC uptake.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>The ACCORd intervention is adapted from the successful US Contraceptive CHOICE study and involves training GPs to provide &#x02018;LARC First&#x02019; structured contraceptive counselling to women seeking contraception, and implementing rapid referral pathways for LARC insertion. Letters of invitation will be sent to 600 GPs in South-Eastern Melbourne. Using randomisation stratified by whether the GP inserts LARCs or not, a total of 54 groups will be allocated to the intervention (online &#x02018;LARC First&#x02019; training and rapid referral pathways) or control arm (usual care). We aim to recruit 729 women from each arm. The primary outcome will be the number of LARCs inserted; secondary outcomes include the women's choice of contraceptive method and quality of life (Short Form Health Survey, SF-36). The costs and outcomes of the intervention and control will be compared in a cost-effectiveness analysis.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The ACCORd study has been approved by the Monash University Human Research Ethics Committee: CF14/3990-2014002066 and CF16/188-2016000080. Any protocol modifications will be communicated to Ethics Committee and Trial Registration registry. The authors plan to disseminate trial outcomes through formal academic pathways comprising journal articles, nation and international conferences and reports, as well as using more &#x02018;popular&#x02019; strategies including seminars, workshops and media engagements.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration number</title><p>ACTRN12615001346561.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Long Acting Reversible Contraceptives (LARCs)</kwd><kwd>Contraception</kwd><kwd>Counselling</kwd><kwd>General Practitioners</kwd><kwd>Cluster randomised controlled trial</kwd><kwd>Complex interventions</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><boxed-text position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Strengths and limitations of this study</title></caption><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The Australian Contraceptive ChOice pRoject (ACCORd), building on an already successful US study-The Contraceptive CHOICE Project, is trialling a multifaceted practice-based intervention.

In Australia, there is no reliable data concerning women's pregnancy intentions; however, a cross-sectional survey of a nationally representative sample of Australian women found that around 51% had experienced an unintended pregnancy in their lifetime.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Unintended pregnancies have significant consequences both socially and economically. In the UK, it is estimated that the healthcare and social costs of unintended pregnancies can be as much as &#x000a3;1 billion per year.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Estimates for the USA put the cost of abortions, miscarriage management, antenatal care, births and infant medical care for unintended pregnancies at around US$9.6&#x02013;US$12.6 billion per annum.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p><p>While a number of safe contraceptive methods are currently available to women, the effectiveness of different methods in preventing pregnancy varies widely. Apart from permanent sterilisation methods (such as vasectomy and tubal ligation), it is generally accepted that long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), including intrauterine devices (IUDs) and progestogen implants, are the most effective at preventing pregnancies<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> due, in part, to their minimal adherence requirements and long duration. In contrast, other methods, such as the oral contraceptives, vaginal ring and condoms (ie, short-acting reversible contraceptives or SARCs), can be very effective at preventing pregnancies, but only when strict adherence is consistently maintained. Given this, it is not surprising that unintended pregnancies still occur during contraception use&#x02014;in the USA, around 48% of unintended pregnancies are associated with contraception use during the month of conception.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> The incidence of unintended pregnancy varies, however, according to the contraceptive method used with around 0.05&#x02013;0.8% of women conceiving during first year use of a LARC method compared with around 3&#x02013;32% of women using other reversible methods.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Findings from the US Contraceptive CHOICE Project indicate that the risk of contraceptive failure among women who use oral contraceptives, a transdermal patch or a vaginal ring is 20 times greater than the risk among women who use LARCs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></p><p>Cost-effectiveness analyses of different contraceptive methods have also favoured LARC use. A UK study reported that despite the high start-up costs related to health service delivery, all LARC methods were more effective and less costly than the combined oral contraceptives.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Similar findings are reported in the USA where, apart from the irreversible methods, LARC methods have been found to be the least expensive and most effective contraceptive method.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> From a cost-savings perspective, if 10% of US women aged between 20 and 29&#x02005;years switched to a LARC method, then approximately US$375 million per year could potentially be saved from the cost of unintended pregnancies and contraception use.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Despite their effectiveness in preventing pregnancies, and evidence of their cost-effectiveness in numerous countries, a number of barriers to LARC uptake have been identified. In studies examining patients' understanding of LARCs, specific details and knowledge of the benefits of LARCs were found to be low among women.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>
<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Additionally, many women still hold myths and misconceptions about the side effects and risks associated with LARCs.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In particular, negative views about IUDs causing infection and infertility have persisted despite evidence that modern forms are safe for use in all women (including young nulliparous women), and are highly effective at preventing unintended pregnancies without impacting future fertility.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>
<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>Health practitioners' knowledge and experience of LARC methods is also lacking. A UK study exploring the views of general practitioners (GPs) and nurse practitioners reported that when asked about an ideal contraceptive for a 19-year-old woman with no children, only 27% would consider an implant and 2% an IUD, compared with 85% and 80% who would consider combined oral contraceptives and condoms, respectively.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> These practitioners identified lack of skill in delivering the methods (61%), concern over irregular vaginal bleeding (50%) and concern about high method discontinuation rates (21%) as their key issues around LARC provision.</p><p>GPs' views on contraception can also influence the advice they give to potential users, what contraceptive methods are made available to women, and the type of contraception selected by patients.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18&#x02013;21</xref> Although a recent review of barriers preventing the widespread use of IUDs among nulliparous women identified healthcare provider, health system and user barriers, the beliefs of healthcare providers were found to have the most profound effect on the uptake of IUDs.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> An Australian survey of women presenting for IUD insertion found that 18% had been told by either a health professional, friend or family member that it was not a suitable method for them, despite these women meeting the appropriate medical eligibility criteria.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></p><p>Several interventions to increase LARC uptake have been tested. Most of these have focused on one form of LARC only (mainly IUDs) or have targeted either providers or women, but not both. A Cochrane review of interventions reported that counselling was effective in increasing the uptake of IUDs.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Women who were (1) provided with contraceptive counselling and referrals by trained community-based workers; (2) provided with antenatal contraceptive counselling; or (3) provided with postnatal couple contraceptive counselling prior to discharge, were found to have a higher uptake of copper IUDs compared with those who did not receive any form of counselling. Additionally, acceptability of levonorgestrel implants is enhanced by effective counselling, particularly preinsertion, even in the presence of side effects.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>
<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>Counselling and providing LARCs at no cost has also proven to be an effective intervention in several settings. In a study involving women who had abortions, a significant increase (6.3&#x02013;36.3%) in the uptake of levonorgestrel-containing intrauterine systems (LNG-IUS) was reported among women who received the interventions postabortion compared with those in the control group.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> Furthermore, 89% of these women were still using LNG-IUS after 6&#x02005;weeks, with only a slight decrease after 6&#x02005;months (81%). A follow-up study on the same cohort of women reported that those who had used LARCs had significantly lower return rates for repeat abortion compared with those who had used other contraceptive methods.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></p><p>In response to the increasing number of unintended pregnancies in the USA, and the low uptake of LARCs, the Contraceptive CHOICE Project (CHOICE) started in 2007. The primary aim of this prospective cohort study was to reduce the number of unintended pregnancies by providing contraception at no cost to women in St Louis, Missouri, and promoting the use of LARCs through structured contraceptive counselling.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> During the 5-year study period, a total of 9526 women aged between 14 and 45&#x02005;years were enrolled. Reported outcomes include a higher rate of LARC uptake compared with the reported national rate;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> a significant reduction in abortion rates compared with the regional and national rates;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> lower birth rates among women aged 15&#x02013;19&#x02005;years compared with the national rate;<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> and high rates of continuation for IUDs and implant at 24&#x02005;months.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> These outcomes not only support the use of LARCs for reducing unintended pregnancies, but reinforce the importance of educating women about LARCs as a way of increasing the rate of LARC uptake.</p><p>The efficacy of LARC effectiveness counselling even when usual contraceptive costs are maintained has also been tested in the USA. Harper <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> conducted a cluster randomised control trial aimed at improving the knowledge and counselling, and insertion skills of providers at 40 reproductive health clinics. Providers in half of the clinics received a training intervention designed to improve their knowledge and counselling, and insertion skills, while the other half were instructed to provide usual care. Reported outcomes include: of the 1500 women who participated in the study, more women in the intervention arm (28%) selected LARCs during their contraceptive visit than those in the control arm (17%) where usual care was provided.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>No interventions designed to increase LARC uptake among Australian women have been tested. The prescription and use of LARCs in Australia is very low despite clinical practice guidance and statements by peak bodies advocating an increase in the use of LARCs.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In a survey of women aged 16&#x02013;59&#x02005;years conducted in 2001&#x02013;2002, &#x0003c;3% reported using LARCs (IUDs 1.2%; implants 1.1%).<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Similarly, data from the household, income and labour dynamics in Australia survey in 2005 indicated that &#x0003c;5% of women who were at risk of pregnancy were using LARCs (1.6% were using an IUD and 2.8% were using an implant).<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Analysis of Australian general practice consultations using data from the Bettering the Evaluation and Care of Health (BEACH) programme indicated that only 6.9% of all contraception consultations involved LARCs.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In this country, general practice is the &#x02018;first line&#x02019; in the delivery of contraception to women and the management of sexual and reproductive health concerns; therefore, interventions aimed at increasing LARC uptake in the general practice setting are critical and likely to have the most impact.</p><p>ACCORd is an Australian adaption of the US Contraceptive CHOICE Project. The study aims to test whether an educational intervention targeting GPs and establishing a fast-track referral process are a cost-effective means of increasing the uptake of LARCs among Australian women. This intervention has the potential to increase the uptake of LARCs among Australian women by addressing patient, practitioner and system barriers, and reduce the rates of unintended pregnancies in Australia.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>This study is a CONSORT compliant<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) of a complex intervention that involves training GPs to provide &#x02018;LARC First&#x02019; structured contraceptive counselling and implementing rapid referral pathways to LARC insertion.

Materials from the &#x02018;LARC First&#x02019; online training site of the Contraceptive CHOICE Project<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> were adapted to the Australian context with input from an advisory group comprising the project investigators, GPs and consumers. Training will be delivered online with additional practice visits, email and telephone support available. To ensure fidelity of the counselling, within 4&#x02005;weeks of recruitment to the trial, random visits to all GPs will be conducted. During this visit, a researcher (blinded to the allocation of the GP to intervention or control arm) will observe a single consultation and complete a checklist. It is anticipated that a higher proportion of GPs in the intervention arm will deliver LARC-First structured counselling with the intent that was envisioned by the ACCORd team. This fidelity check will provide us with insights that will help explain the trial outcomes, that is, a change in LARC uptake.</p><p>Structured contraceptive counselling<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> will be delivered to the participating women by the intervention trained GPs. These GPs will provide a non-biased, scripted description of all available contraceptive methods, with particular reference to the safety and efficacy of each method. They will also collect clinical information from the women to identify any contraindications or conditions that may influence the choice of contraception&#x02014;women will be able to choose their contraception method provided that it is not medically contraindicated. The GP will then screen the woman for pregnancy (urine pregnancy test) and chlamydia (according to clinical practice guidelines published by the RACGP).<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> On ruling out pregnancy, the GP will either: (1) provide a prescription for the method of choice; (2) offer &#x02018;same day&#x02019; insertion of the LARC method, or at a subsequent time at the GP clinic; or (3) provide an appointment for insertion of the LARC method at one of the insertion clinics. Emergency contraception will be offered to women who have had recent unprotected intercourse, while &#x02018;quick start&#x02019; contraception (ie, starting contraception at any time rather than at the start of the next menstrual cycle) will be offered to women (as per the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Healthcare guidelines<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>) in cases where pregnancy cannot yet be ruled out. These women will also be offered the opportunity to return in 3&#x02013;4&#x02005;weeks for a LARC insertion (and a repeat pregnancy test).</p><p>A rapid referral pathway to a LARC insertion clinic will be implemented for instances where the intervention group GP does not undertake insertions in their own rooms&#x02014;GPs will book appointments for women to have a LARC insertion at study-specific LARC insertion clinics provided in the rooms of local private gynaecologists.

<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> In Australia, national surveys have indicated a low uptake of LARC methods among reproductive aged women.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Strategies to increase Australian women's access to LARCs are important in addressing this pattern, and interventions that provide women with greater contraceptive choice will give them greater autonomy over their reproductive lives.</p><p>ACCORd aims to evaluate a complex intervention that involves training GPs to provide &#x02018;LARC First&#x02019; structured contraceptive counselling and implementing rapid referral pathways to LARC insertion. This intervention addresses a number of potential barriers to LARC uptake in Australia. Through education, practitioners will receive knowledge and training for the delivery of accurate evidence-based information to women during contraceptive counselling. Women will therefore be better informed when choosing contraception, and more able to make choices that suit their wants and needs. Further, the provision of rapid referral pathways for LARC insertion provides better access to the timely LARC insertion. These approaches address practitioner, patient and systems barriers to LARC insertion and therefore this intervention has the potential to increase the uptake of LARCs among Australian women and reduce the rates of unintended pregnancies in Australia.</p><p>Currently there is limited Australian information about the economic cost of unintended pregnancy, or the cost-effectiveness of LARCs. The ACCORd economic evaluation (one component of the study) accounts for the cost structure of the Australian health system, including issues such as reimbursement by the MBS and PBS and out-of-pocket costs to women. It will demonstrate where the burden of costs falls in increasing the use of LARCs (individuals vs the health system), as well as any potential cost-savings from using LARCs both for government and women. Further, the study will show the benefits to women of using LARCs not just in terms of reducing unplanned pregnancies, but also in terms of their quality of life.</p><p>Based on the trial results, which will include both the effectiveness of the intervention at increasing the rate of LARC uptake and a CEA of the intervention, this study will help evaluate the advantages of rolling out the intervention more widely. It also has the potential to make important recommendations about how to improve the current Australian system concerning the provision of LARCs. Finally, the intervention will contribute to national and international work concerning interventions and strategies to increasing the uptake of LARCs, and consequently reduce unintended pregnancy rates.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Dr Maria de Leon-Santiago from the Department of General Practice, Monash University, who provided medical writing services on behalf of the ACCORd research team.</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Contributors:</bold> DM has led the development of this proposal.
