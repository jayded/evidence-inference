Several attempts have been made to address this problem such as diet changes, lowering carbohydrate intake, efficient oral hygiene measures and rinsing fluoride mouthwashes [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Application of sealants [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], fluoride releasing bonding agents [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], elastic modules impregnated with fluoride [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and fluoride varnishes are the most commonly used preventative methods by orthodontists. Despite all these efforts, we still witness white spot lesions following bracket removal. If a void exists between the adhesive and enamel surface at the margin of brackets, this could lead to microleakage and accumulation of cariogenic bacteria in inaccessible areas [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Such voids are responsible for some cases of white spot lesions. These lesions occur in about 45% of orthodontic patients [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and according to a previous study, they have a higher incidence in males [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. They are unsightly and appear as enamel opacity, involving at least one-third of the labial surface [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Occasionally, they may result in discontinuation of treatment without achieving the treatment goals. Another concern is the gap between metal brackets and adhesives. Empty pockets at the margins of this interface should be prevented. Corrosion and craters in the stainless steel bracket base initiate at the gap developed between the brackets and adhesives.</p><p>Arhun et al. investigated the amount of microleakage following the application of different adhesive systems for bonding ceramic and metal brackets. In their study, the amount of microleakage was reported to be higher beneath the metal brackets at both interfaces regardless of the adhesive system used [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Uysal et al, also reported higher amount of microleakage at the gingival in comparison to the occlusal margin (light curing was done at the occlusal margin for both adhesive systems) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Although use of light activated composites has become popular in orthodontics, prevention of light penetration by metal brackets, the most commonly used attachments in fixed orthodontics, is a major concern [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Also, the stress due to the polymerization shrinkage is among the most important problems associated with light-activated composites [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>If the contracting forces of curing resins overcome the bond of adhesive, marginal failure and microleakage may result [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. To overcome this side effect, various curing procedures have been proposed.</p><p>The suggested three-sided light curing technique was based on the assumption that contraction of photo-activated composite resin is directed toward the light source [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In our study, the transillumination technique was used to assess its efficacy for bonding of metal brackets. This method was initially suggested for cementation of acid-etched fixed partial dentures. In this technique, the light is illuminated from the back of the teeth with attachments [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Some previous studies have investigated the bond strength of visible light-cured composites using transillumination as a curing technique [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In 2013, Kumar et al. showed that 90% of light intensity was lost when using transillumination technique for bonding brackets. They demonstrated that this reduction was related to the buccolingual dimension of teeth. However, they found that both the conventional method and transillumination technique yielded similar results in terms of bond strength of metal brackets [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Also, in 2013 Heravi et al. concluded that to achieve an acceptable bracket bond strength for the posterior teeth, doubling the curing time from 40 to 80 seconds and increasing the light intensity to 800 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> during transillumination technique were required [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. From the previous studies it can be concluded that transillumination is an applicable technique for improving the bond strength; however, marginal seal is also an important factor to prevent marginal corrosion and bacterial attacks, and inappropriate marginal seal can lead to white spot lesions or bracket bond failure during the course of treatment. To the best of our knowledge, no study has evaluated the effect of transillumination as a curing technique on the microleakage beneath metal orthodontic brackets. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of transillumination as a light curing technique on the amount of microleakage, in comparison to the conventional technique of curing, using two methods of enamel conditioning.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>According to a study by Arhun et al, 120 freshly extracted bovine deciduous mandibular incisors were collected for this study [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The teeth were examined to be free of surface developmental defects and cracks under direct light. The soft tissue remnants and the debris were removed and the specimens were polished with pumice paste and rubber cups for 10 seconds each, and were then stored in distilled water for one month. Before the onset of the bonding process, all the specimens were disinfected by immersion in 1% thymol solution for one week.</p><p>The middle-third of the enamel surface of each tooth was prepared using two enamel preparation methods. The first method included the use of 37% phosphoric acid gel (Unitek, Monrovia, CA) for enamel conditioning and Transbond XT primer (3M, Unitek, Monrovia, CA) as a sealant. In the second method, Transbond Plus (3M, Unitek, Monrovia, CA) was applied as self-etching primer. The stainless steel twin maxillary central incisor brackets (.022-in-Daynalock series, 3M, Monrovia, CA) were bonded on the middle third of the buccal surface in all samples with Transbond XT (3M, Unitek, Monrovia, CA), a light-cured orthodontic resin, using a light curing unit (Coltolux 75, Coltene/Whaledent GmbH, Langenau, Germany) with a light intensity of 530 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>In order to maintain a fixed distance and angle of light curing, a holder was designed and used to set the position of the samples at 5 mm distance from the tip of the light-curing unit. The device held the samples vertically in such a way that the tip of the light-curing unit was perpendicular to the long axis of the samples on both sides depending on the group of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The samples were randomly divided into four groups of 30 teeth and were prepared as follows:
<list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Group I: The teeth were etched with 37% phosphoric acid for 30 seconds, and then rinsed and dried for 20 seconds with oil-free air spray. The brackets were bonded using Transbond XT primer as the sealant and Transbond XT as the adhesive. Finally, the mesial and distal margins of the brackets were light cured for 10 seconds each.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group II: The same methods of enamel preparation and bracket bonding were applied as in group I; but transillumination (applying the light source to the middle third of the lingual surface) was used for 50 seconds as the technique of resin polymerization.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group III: Transbond Plus self-etching primer was applied for 3&#x02013;5 seconds with mild pressure of the brush according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions, followed by a gentle burst of air for 1&#x02013;2 seconds. Then, the brackets were bonded using Transbond XT and 10 seconds of light curing was performed at the mesial and distal margins.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Group IV: The same method of enamel preparation as in group III was applied; but transillumination for 50 seconds from the lingual side was used as the method of curing. Thermal cycling in deionized water was performed at 5 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0; C &#x02013; 55 &#x000b1; 2&#x000b0; C for 500 cycles with a dwell time of 30 seconds and transfer time of 5 seconds. Then, the samples were stored in distilled water at room temperature and a dark environment for three months for the aging process.</p></list-item></list></p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>(A) The holder used for sample preparation.

In subgroup one, the teeth were sectioned from the middle of the brackets in incisogingival direction while in subgroup two, the teeth were sectioned in mesiodistal direction to evaluate the margins that were directly light cured as instructed by the manufacturer. The apices of all teeth were sealed with sticky wax and then all surfaces were coated with two layers of nail varnish except for 1 mm around the bracket margins. In the next step, the samples were immersed in 0.5% basic fuchsine solution for 24 hours at room temperature.</p><p>After removal from the solution, the teeth were rinsed with distilled water, the superficial dye was removed with a brush and the teeth were left to dry.</p><p>The samples were embedded in epoxy resin blocks according to the direction of sections using an index in the heavy putty impression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2.</label><caption><p>One sample fixed in the holding chuck of the cutting machine (Struers, Denmark) before sectioning (A) and after sectioning (B)</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JOD-12-436-g002"/></fig><p>Sectioning was carried out using a low-speed diamond saw (Accutom-50, Struers, Denmark).</p><p>All samples were numbered before sectioning according to their group allocation and were examined randomly under a stereomicroscope (Motic, Xiamen, China) at &#x000d7;40 magnification.

sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Enamel decalcification during fixed orthodontic treatment is a major concern for clinicians. This process occurs rapidly and mineral loss has been reported even within a few months of treatment initiation [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The aim of the current study was to compare the amount of microleakage of an orthodontic adhesive following the use of two different methods of enamel conditioning and light curing.</p><p>In this study, we used bovine incisors as available substitutes for human incisors. Bovine deciduous lower incisors have nearly the size of permanent human maxillary central incisors, which are the most ideal for testing bonding properties since they provide flat bonding surfaces. These two types of teeth have been compared in a number of previous studies [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The assumption that the contraction of photo-activated composite resins is directed toward the light source [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and also the problem of not being able to directly cure the composite resin under metal brackets led to the idea of evaluating transillumination as a method of curing in this study. Behrents et al, also supported the use of this technique for bonding of lingual attachments due to its practical application in the oral environment [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the current study, the group conditioned with self-etching primer showed less microleakage. One reason for less microleakage following the use of self-etching adhesive systems at margins cured directly could be the simultaneous penetration of etchant and monomer and the identical length of primer tags in the etched enamel.</p><p>In contrast to the conventional method of enamel conditioning, self-etching primers produce a uniform and more conservative etched pattern providing uniform adhesive penetration and less aggressive enamel demineralization [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. In a study conducted by Vicente et al, on the effect of thermocycling on the microleakage beneath brackets bonded to bovine incisors, they found that microleakage increased significantly at the enamel-adhesive interface when using Transbond XT as the bonding agent [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. In the current study, thermocycling was performed for all samples. This may explain the greater amount of microleakage at all margins in comparison with some other studies on this topic [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. In 2013, Sabzevari et al. demonstrated that thermocycling did not significantly increase the microleakage when a self-etching primer was used as a conditioner. However, comparison of different methods of bonding after thermocycling showed no significant differences between self-etching primers and the conventional method of conditioning [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>Surface conditioning causes leakage of fluid and bacteria beneath the orthodontic brackets; thus, a deeper etching pattern with acid etchant cannot guarantee an interface free of microleakage [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. This is also supported by an in vivo study by Feigal and Quelhas [<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p><p>On the other hand, less penetrated resin tags in these systems may not resist the contracting forces of resin shrinkage [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. However, this is acceptable in restorative dentistry when a bulk of composite is placed in a prepared cavity [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Orthodontic adhesive layers are very thin and the free, floating brackets are pulled closer to the enamel surface by the shrinkage [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. The amount of microleakage reported in our study was lower than that in some previous studies [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]; this finding is in agreement with less microleakage reported for Transbond XT in an in vitro study by Sener et al [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Less microleakage at the margins of specimens in self-etching primer groups cured directly is similar to the results of a study by Uysal et al, which showed significantly higher scores at the gingival compared to the occlusal margins (where the tip of the light curing unit was positioned) [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>Another factor that should be taken into account regarding the microleakage scores is a phenomenon called percolation. The linear coefficient of thermal expansion for enamel, metal brackets and the adhesive is not the same (&#x003b1;=12 for enamel, &#x003b1;=16 for stainless steel brackets and &#x003b1;=20&#x02013;55 ppm/c for composite resin) [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. These materials expand and contract at different rates when hot and cold foods are consumed; thus, the fluids are sucked in and pushed out at the margins of the brackets bonded to the teeth in both tooth-adhesive and adhesive-bracket interfaces. This can lead to microbial leakage at both interfaces [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>The greater the light energy received by the composite, the greater the polymerization; therefore, transillumination must provide greater light energy than direct curing [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Since pulpal temperature should not exceed 5&#x000b0;&#x02013;6&#x000b0; C, extending the exposure time should be done with caution. With 1 mm of dentine between the composite and the pulp, the temperature increases to 6&#x000b0;C with 40 seconds of continuous exposure [<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In orthodontics, the enamel and dentine are thicker and provide greater pulpal insulation. Oesterle and Shellhart reported comparable bond strength in the group using transillumination for 50 seconds with the group cured for 40 seconds at the margins [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, Heravi et al. concluded that 80 seconds of curing with high power mode of Blue Phase C8LED light curing unit with transillumination technique resulted in a clinically acceptable shear bond strength of brackets to posterior teeth with no risk of pulpal damage [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>As reported by Yazici et al, and Haiduc et al, LED units cause significantly lower rise of pulp temperature in comparison with halogen light curing units [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In the current study, the amount of microleakage in the transillumination groups was comparable to that in the conventional curing groups at most of the margins of brackets except for the gingival margin. This may be due to the reflection of light from the bracket base as was pointed out by Oesterle and Shellhart [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p><p>Also, in 2013 Kumar et al. showed that even though the amount of light intensity lost in transillumination technique was significant, there were no differences in the shear bond strength of brackets bonded by transillumination technique or conventional method of curing at the mesial and distal margins [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>In our study, only at the gingival margin of the samples, irrespective of the method of enamel conditioning, a significant amount of microleakage was observed. This may be explained by the gradual increase of buccolingual width from the incisal toward the gingival side. Consequently, although some studies reported adequate bond strength by transillumination, microleakage should be a concern especially in teeth with greater thickness.</p><p>As concluded by Heravi et al, to achieve an acceptable bracket bond strength to the posterior teeth, doubling the curing time from 40 to 80 seconds and increasing the light intensity to 800 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> during the transillumination technique should be done [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>].</p><p>In studies by Ramuglu et al, and Uysal et al, light was irradiated from the occlusal surface and a significant amount of microleakage was reported at the gingival margin. They reasoned that this result might be due to the degradation of light intensity and insufficient polymerization of composite [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Other studies in which the samples were cured according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions did not score the microleakage at the directly cured margins (mesial and distal margins) [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>In our study, the manufacturers&#x02019; instructions were followed in all groups and evaluation of all margins showed that the amount of microleakage at the mesial and distal margins was lower than that at the incisal and gingival margins and these differences were statistically significant in groups which received self-etching primer for enamel conditioning. Polymerization starts in areas of resin closest to the light source. Even for metal brackets the best result will be gained if light is irradiated from all four sides of brackets. However, a well-designed study on this technique of curing may better elucidate this topic. It is impossible to extrapolate the results of an in vitro study to the actual oral environment; thus, future studies are necessary for further assessment of results.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of this study, use of self-etching primer and conventional light curing method caused less microleakage compared to the transillumination technique. Microleakage will be minimized if all margins of brackets are cured directly. The transillumination technique, irrespective of the method of enamel preparation, caused greater microleakage in both interfaces at the gingival margin and thus should not be used as the method of curing in orthodontic treatment.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><label>1-</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
