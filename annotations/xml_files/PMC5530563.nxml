The CLL8 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>] has shown that even though almost double the number of patients receiving fludarabine, cyclophosphamide and rituximab (FCR) achieved minimal residual disease (MRD) negativity (defined as &#x0003c;0.01% CLL cells) compared with those receiving fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, once low-level MRD was achieved, both arms showed the same prognostic significance. This indirectly implies that the depth of the remission may be more important than the type of treatment given to attain that remission. Attainment of MRD negativity has also been demonstrated as an independent predictor of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) even with a variety of different treatment approaches and regardless of the line of therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p id="Par42">The researchers in the U.K. National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) CLL207 phase II trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] assessed whether participants with low levels of disease could attain MRD negativity following consolidation therapy with alemtuzumab. The results showed good efficacy, with 39 (83%) of 47 participants who were consolidated attaining MRD negativity. Overall, 38% remained MRD-negative in the peripheral blood 6&#x000a0;months after therapy, which may be the true MRD-negative population because this represents the time for redistribution of the disease among various compartments following antibody treatment. After a median follow-up of 44&#x000a0;months, the participants who were MRD-negative 6&#x000a0;months after treatment had a significantly increased PFS time compared with those participants who were MRD-positive, with a median PFS at 3&#x000a0;years of 94.4% in MRD-negative participants compared with 60.0% in MRD-positive participants (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.004). However, alemtuzumab had a significant toxicity profile, with 22 serious adverse event (SAEs), 4 of which were clinically unacceptable (1 pneumocystis pneumonia, 1 parainfluenza-related death and 2 Epstein-Barr virus-related transformed diseases), reported in 17 (36.2%) participants.</p><p id="Par43">Obinutuzumab (GA-101) is a novel monoclonal antibody and has been shown to have greater efficacy in CLL than previous anti-CD20 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], with reports of MRD negativity when used to treat progressive CLL. In addition, because the cells targeted by obinutuzumab are B cells rather than all lymphocytes (including T cells), obinutuzumab is likely to be significantly less immunosuppressive than alemtuzumab. The study of obinutuzumab within the clinical trial setting has demonstrated a rapid response in peripheral blood lymphocytosis, with early reports of patients achieving MRD negativity with obinutuzumab [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Rationale for therapeutic study</title><p id="Par44">MRD-negative patients have a survival advantage in comparison to MRD-positive patients, regardless of the approach used to achieve MRD negativity.

Patients who are MRD-negative will not be eligible for randomisation but will still be followed annually for MRD. Patients who are MRD-positive will have bone marrow and trephine samples tested centrally to confirm MRD level in the aspirate, a stratification factor for randomisation. To be randomised, participants must have an MRD-positive peripheral blood sample between 3 and 24&#x000a0;months since completing the last treatment for CLL and be confirmed as MRD-positive in the bone marrow. Participants must also have clinically and radiologically confirmed absence of lymphadenopathy (largest lymph node 1.5&#x000a0;cm or less in minimum diameter).</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par58">The overall sample size of the trial is powered for the phase III primary endpoint of PFS. An internal literature review investigating patients who have received up to three lines of previous therapy of any type and who responded to their most recent therapy with at least a PR suggested that 3&#x000a0;years is a reasonable estimate for median PFS in the control population (i.e., no consolidation), which translates to approximately 2&#x000a0;years from the time the participants are randomised (because it will be 3&#x02013;24 months after previous therapy). An important clinical improvement would be an increase in median PFS from 2 to 3.3&#x000a0;years, a relatively large improvement, because consolidation is given at a time when patients would otherwise be in remission and treatment-free. The trial is powered to test the null hypothesis of no difference in PFS between the treatment arms, with a two-sided 5% level of significance and 80% power. Assuming 3&#x000a0;years of recruitment, 3&#x000a0;years of follow-up and allowing for a 5% drop-out rate, 188 participants are required (94 per arm) in order to observe 120 progression/death events. Losses to follow-up for the primary endpoint are expected to be extremely uncommon due to the short treatment duration and straightforward and regular follow-up schedule. A formal interim analysis on PFS will be carried out and reported to the data monitoring and ethics committee (DMEC) when half the required number of events have been observed (60 events).</p><p id="Par59">The O&#x02019;Brien and Fleming alpha-spending function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] will be used to adjust for multiple testing to conserve the overall type I error, which recommends that the interim results be compared with a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.005, and the final analysis results are then compared with a <italic>p</italic> value of 0.047.</p><p id="Par60">Because obinutuzumab has not previously been used in a consolidation setting, the short-term endpoint of MRD negativity will be assessed to determine whether continuation to the phase III part of the trial is worthwhile. Because it may take up to 9&#x000a0;months from recruiting the last participant to the time of analysis to determine their MRD response, there will be a two-stage phase II design to allow the first stage to be reviewed as early as possible and prior to the completion of recruitment to the second stage (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). It is not planned to pause recruitment to wait for the phase II outcomes, but the DMEC, on review of the safety and early efficacy data, can choose to implement this should they feel it necessary.</p><p id="Par61">Simon&#x02019;s two-stage optimal design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] will be used to set stopping bounds at each stage of the analysis (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). A negativity rate above 35% would deem the therapy active, and a success rate below 15% would deem the therapy inactive. Participants randomised to consolidation therapy with obinutuzumab who receive at least 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment will be included in the phase II populations. With a 10% significance level and 80% power, the trial will continue after the first stage if, among the first nine participants, at least two (22%) achieve MRD negativity. The trial will continue after the second stage into the phase III part of the trial if, among the first 23 participants, at least 6 (26%) achieve MRD negativity. Patients recruited during phase II will contribute to the final phase III target of 188 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Recruitment and consent</title><p id="Par62">Participants will be recruited from approximately 40 research centres within the United Kingdom under the guidance of the NCRI CLL sub-group.

AEs will be recorded from randomisation until 30&#x000a0;days after the last dose of trial treatment (or 4&#x000a0;months post-randomisation for participants randomised to no treatment) or disease progression, and they will be evaluated for duration, intensity and causal relationship with the trial medication according to the CTCAE version 4.03.</p><p id="Par84">SAEs and serious adverse reactions (SARs) are events that are fatal or life-threatening, require or prolong hospitalisation, are significantly or permanently disabling or incapacitating, constitute a congenital anomaly or a birth defect, or any other important medical event. SARs are SAEs that are deemed to be possibly related to any dose administered of any trial treatment. Suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions (SUSARs) are SARs that are not listed in the reference safety information for that medicinal product. SAEs will be collected from randomisation until 3&#x000a0;months after the last dose of treatment (or 6&#x000a0;months post-randomisation for participants randomised to no consolidation therapy). SARs and SUSARs should be reported from the start of treatment and for the duration of the trial.

A validation check program will be incorporated into the trial database to verify the data, and discrepancy reports will be generated for resolution by the investigator. Priority validations will be incorporated into the validation programme to ensure that any discrepancies related to participant rights or safety are expedited to sites for resolution. Data will be monitored for quality and completeness by the CTRU. Missing data will be chased until received, confirmed as not available or the trial is at analysis. The CTRU/sponsor will reserve the right to intermittently conduct source data verification exercises on a sample of participants, which will be carried out by staff from the CTRU/sponsor. Source data verification will involve direct access to participant notes at the participating hospital sites and the central collection of copies of consent forms and other relevant investigation reports.

The phase III analyses will be conducted on the ITT population, where participants will be included according to the treatment to which they were randomised. A per-protocol analysis, where participants will be included according to the treatment they received, will be considered for the phase III primary endpoint of PFS if there are a considerable number of protocol violators.

The phase III primary endpoint of PFS will be assessed once 120 events (progressions/deaths) have been observed overall. A formal interim analysis will be carried out when 60 events have been observed overall in order to allow large differences between the trial arms to be reported early (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>). PFS is defined as the time from randomisation to first documented evidence of progression or death. Participants not having progressed or died or who are lost to follow-up at the time of the phase III analyses will be censored at the last date they were known to be alive and progression-free. For the analysis of primacy, we will use a Cox proportional hazards model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] to compare the trial arms, adjusting for the minimisation factors, to calculate the HR and corresponding 95% CIs.

The trial is sponsored by the University of Leeds (R&#x00026;D Office, 34 Hyde Terrace, Leeds, LS2 9LN, UK), co-ordinated by the CTRU, University of Leeds, and is registered with two trial databases (ISRCTN64035629, EudraCT 2014-000880-42). The trial will be conducted in accordance with the principles of GCP in clinical trials, as applicable under U.K. regulations, the NHS Research Governance Framework and through adherence to CTRU standard operating procedures. The CTRU/sponsor has systems in place to ensure that serious breaches of GCP or the trial protocol are identified and reported. Ethical approval has been obtained from the National Research Ethics Service Committee Yorkshire &#x00026; Humber &#x02013; Leeds East (reference 14/YH/1199). A sample of data will be assessed by on-site source data verification by the CTRU, and this is not independent from the sponsor. The University of Leeds will be liable for negligent harm caused by the design of the trial. No additional compensation for clinical negligence will be provided for trial participants over that which is available to NHS patients. Obinutuzumab was provided by the sponsor only for the duration of protocol treatment, and subsequent treatment will be provided as per standard care.</p><p id="Par97">A core project team, a TMG, a TSC and a DMEC have been established. The independent DMEC will review the safety and ethics of the trial, as overseen by the independent TSC. The TSC will monitor trial progress and the overall direction. Three-monthly interim safety reports are presented to the DMEC, with a full review done annually. The DMEC will also review SARs and SUSARs that result in death in real time. This committee, in light of the interim data and of any advice or evidence they wish to request, will advise the TSC if there are any concerns or reasons that the trial should not continue. The results of the study will be published in peer-reviewed publications and will be presented at relevant national and international conferences. There are no plans to use professional writers for presenting the outcomes of this trial. Any protocol changes are disseminated by the CTRU to the relevant parties.

Recruitment numbers provided during feasibility assessment were significantly higher than observed during trial recruitment. We believe this was due partly to improved first- and second-line treatments providing a more durable remission, resulting in fewer MRD-positive patients at 3&#x02013;24 months post-treatment. With more recent targeted therapies, treatment now continues for much longer than the standard 6-month period (with FCR, for example). This is likely to have reduced the number of eligible patients.</p><p id="Par99">Whilst acceptance of the trial by patients has been high, the prospect of returning to hospital for further treatment is seen as an additional burden for many, particularly those who would be required to travel a long way to their nearest hospital. Because the trial protocol represents an additional cost for the NHS Trust compared with standard treatment, it has been difficult to enrol centres into the study, despite wide support from investigators. The aim of the findings of the GALACTIC trial is to compare consolidation with obinutuzumab with no consolidation with respect to PFS in patients who have responded to previous therapy with a CR or good PR with low levels of MRD.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par100">The trial opened to recruitment in February 2015 using protocol version 2.0 (registered 30 October 2014) and closed to recruitment in February 2017.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><sec id="Sec30"><p>
