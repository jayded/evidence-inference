Fourteen patients requiring extraction of the maxillary or mandibular posterior teeth were enrolled and allocated into 2 groups. After extraction, demineralized bovine bone matrix mixed with 10% collagen (DBBM-C) was grafted and the socket was covered by porcine collagen membrane in a double-layer fashion. No attempt to obtain primary closure was made. The hidden X suture and conventional X suture techniques were performed in the test and control groups, respectively. Cone-beam computed tomographic (CBCT) images were taken immediately after the graft procedure and before implant surgery 4 months later. Additionally, the change in the mucogingival junction (MGJ) position was measured and was compared after extraction, after suturing, and 4 months after the operation.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All sites healed without any complications. Clinical evaluations showed that the MGJ line shifted to the lingual side immediately after the application of the X suture by 1.56&#x000b1;0.90 mm in the control group, while the application of the hidden X suture rather pushed the MGJ line slightly to the buccal side by 0.25&#x000b1;0.66 mm. It was demonstrated that the amount of keratinized tissue (KT) preserved on the buccal side was significantly greater in the hidden X suture group 4 months after the procedure (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Radiographic analysis showed that the hidden X suture had a significant effect in preserving horizontal width and minimizing vertical reduction in comparison to X suture (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our study provided clinical and radiographic verification of the efficacy of the hidden X suture in preserving the width of KT and the dimensions of the alveolar ridge after ARP.</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="graphical"><title>Graphical Abstract</title><p><graphic xlink:href="jpis-46-415-abf001.jpg" position="float" orientation="portrait"/></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author"><kwd>Alveolar process</kwd><kwd>Bone regeneration</kwd><kwd>Bone resorption</kwd><kwd>Suture techniques</kwd><kwd>Tooth extraction</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>The substantial reduction of alveolar bone dimension following tooth extraction has been reported in a number of studies [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], and this phenomenon can have negative consequences for further restorative treatment. To prevent this reduction or at least compensate for the loss of bony dimension, the alveolar ridge preservation (ARP) technique was developed [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The initial stages of research into ARP focused on the extent to which hard tissue collapse could be prevented [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], and a clear benefit for counteracting hard tissue resorption was demonstrated compared to natural healing. However, investigators have recently started to holistically evaluate the effects of ARP not only on the hard tissue, but also on the soft tissue profile [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Although a variety of studies of ARP have been published, methodological heterogeneity has been consistently pointed out in previous systematic reviews [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. The heterogeneity mainly occurred due to different types of biomaterials and surgical techniques. Numerous biomaterials and various combinations thereof have been used, but no material or combination of materials has been established as superior. Surgically, no consensus exists regarding whether the flap should be elevated, whether primary flap closure is mandatory, and so on. Moreover, insufficient evidence exists regarding the duration of healing before the implantation following ARP.</p><p>An issue that is usually neglected, but is very important in the opinion of the authors, is the suture technique following ARP. In most previous studies, the conventional crossed mattress suture (X suture) [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] was generally applied following ridge preservation, especially when primary closure was not intended (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref>). Other studies used the criss-cross suture, which is essentially a horizontal external mattress suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Figure 2</xref>) [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These suture techniques take advantage of pulling vectors to the center of socket to narrow the socket entrance and keep the biomaterial in the socket. However, the authors of the present study have observed soft tissue profiles following ARP sutured using the criss-cross technique or conventional X suture with large losses of facial keratinized tissue (KT) and have noted that the mucogingival junction (MGJ) can be shifted to the lingual side due to the pulling of buccal tissue, especially when the buccal bone is damaged.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>X suture or conventional X suture.

The hidden X suture, which was first presented in a plastic surgery study, is a modification of the conventional X suture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In plastic surgery, it has also been reported that the hidden X suture has certain advantages over the conventional X suture. The latter is more harmful to skin healing, leaving a very visible X mark after healing, whereas the hidden X suture has only 2 minor suture scars far apart. To the best of our knowledge, the hidden X suture has not been discussed in the dental literature, and its benefit in comparison to other suture techniques has not been properly assessed especially for ARP.</p><fig id="F3" fig-type="figure" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 3</label><caption><p>Hidden X suture.

The membrane was not engaged with the suture material, and no attempts for primary flap closure, such as a releasing incision, were made. Immediately after surgery, a cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) scan was taken with a resolution of 1 mm (scan time, 17 seconds; exposure time, 17 seconds; 80 kV, 7 mA) using an Alphard 3030 apparatus (Asahi Roentgen Ind.

Patients were instructed to rinse twice a day with mouthwash (GUM gargle, Osaka, Japan), and received analgesics (Somalgen, Keunhwa, Seoul, Korea) and antibiotics (Sultamox, Keunhwa) for 5 days. All patients were recalled 7&#x02013;10 days later for a check-up and suture removal. The patients then received follow-up care 2, 4, 8, and 16 weeks post-ARP before implant placement.

Previous studies have consistently reported that complete preservation was not achieved even after obtaining primary closure [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], as well as recession and loss of the KT of the adjacent teeth [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In contrast to the common knowledge that bone grafts should be covered by primary intention, Barone et al. [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] demonstrated that an intentional open healing approach to ridge preservation did not affect the results of ridge preservation in comparison to closure with primary intention. Moreover, it has been shown that open healing can substantially increase the width of KT [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>The results of this study corroborate the finding that the open healing approach for ridge preservation can successfully preserve the alveolar bone dimension for implant placement. An interesting finding was that the suture technique significantly affected the soft tissue healing pattern. The conventional X suture is the most common suture following ridge preservation, and insufficient attention has been paid to the fact that this suture technique can create a pulling vector along the buccolingual axis, decreasing the width of the KT. Meanwhile, the hidden X suture can minimize the tension along the buccolingual axis, and it has been shown that it can comparably secure bone grafts and membranes. The application of the hidden X suture immediately pushed the KT to the facial side after suturing, and eventually reduced the loss of KT after a 4-month healing period.</p><p>In the comparison of the dimensions of the extraction socket, the horizontal width at 1 mm from the crest was significantly smaller in the X suture group. It appears that the X suture created a pulling vector along the buccolingual axis, as well as downward pressure, since it is a variation of the horizontal external suture. Meanwhile, the hidden X suture did not apply a significant pressing force on the buccal tissue, which may have prevented horizontal resorption. The X suture also applied downward pressure onto the grafted material, with statistically significant results.</p><p>The importance of KT in implant dentistry cannot be emphasized enough. First, the presence of an adequate keratinized zone enables proper incision placement and easy flap reflection. Additionally, the substantial thickness of KT in natural teeth has long been a controversial issue, although recent systematic reviews have shown that the presence of keratinized mucosa around implants is much more clinically significant than the presence of keratinized mucosa around the natural teeth [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref><xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The presence of KT around implants has been shown to prevent the accumulation of plaque, reduce inflammation, and result in less marginal bone resorption. Clinically, maintaining or increasing the zone of KT usually requires a free gingival graft, an apically positioned flap, or the use of special stents [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]; these techniques are difficult to perform and involve the possibility of significant morbidity for patients. Moreover, none of these approaches can be performed concomitantly with tooth extraction. The soft tissue created by secondary healing over the extraction socket shows satisfactory epithelialization and the connective tissue has a well-structured network of collagen fibers (manuscript in preparation).</p><p>Within the limitations of this study, we demonstrated that the hidden X suturing technique significantly decreased the reduction of the width of KT in comparison to the conventional X suture, and showed that the dimensional change of the alveolar ridge after tooth extraction was minimized by using the hidden X suture after ARP.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>This present research was conducted by the research fund of Dankook University in 2014 (R-0001-27206).</p></ack><fn-group><fn
