The exclusion criteria were as follows: ductal-dependent congenital heart diseases, major congenital malformation, grade 3 to 4 intraventricular hemorrhage, renal impairment (defined as a creatinine concentration of &#x0003e;1.5 mg/dl), pulmonary hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia of &#x0003c;60,000/mm<sup>3</sup>, and an elevated alanine transaminase concentration. Echocardiography was performed for all included infants from 3 to 5 days of age or when they showed symptoms of PDA, whichever occurred earlier. PDA was considered hemodynamically significant if two of the following criteria were present: wide pulse pressure (defined as systolic blood pressure&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;diastolic blood pressure of &#x0003e;&#x000bd; systolic blood pressure), reversal of flow in the descending aorta by Doppler echocardiography, left atrial dilatation determined by a left atrial:aortic root ratio of &#x0003e;1.4:1.0 on M-mode echocardiographic evaluation from the parasternal view, or left ventricular dilatation. We did not include the size of the ductus as a criterion because it is relative to the size of the infant. Symptoms of PDA were metabolic acidosis, increased respiratory demands not explained by respiratory distress syndrome or its complications (usually after a period of improvement), decreased urine output, delayed capillary refill, and newly onset persistent mottling.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="bibr21-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> To fulfill the treatment criteria, infants were required to either demonstrate hsPDA by echocardiography or signs indicating the presence of symptomatic PDA.

Randomization numbers were placed inside sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The following laboratory investigations were conducted within 24 hours before treatment was initiated and within 24 hours after treatment was finished: complete blood count, platelet count, creatinine, and alanine transaminase. A head ultrasound was also performed before and after treatment. The oral paracetamol group received 10 mg/kg/dose followed by 1 to 2&#x02009;ml of 0.9% saline every 6 hours for 3 days. Regarding ibuprofen treatment protocol, previous studies used a loading dose of 10 mg/kg<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="bibr18-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> or 20 mg/kg<sup><xref rid="bibr19-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> on the first day and then half of this dose for the first and second days of treatment. We used the same dose for the 3-day course to minimize errors. The oral ibuprofen group received 10 mg/kg/dose followed by 1 to 2&#x02009;ml of 0.9% saline once daily for 3 days. Echocardiography was repeated within 24 hours of the last treatment.</p><p>Response to treatment was defined as resolution of symptoms with either complete closure of the PDA or a very small hemodynamically insignificant PDA evident by echocardiography. In these cases, echocardiography was repeated before discharge. If no response was found after the first course of treatment, a second course of treatment with the same drug was given for another 3 days. If no response as seen after two courses, a third course of treatment was started using the other drug. If three courses of medical treatment failed, surgery was performed only if the PDA was causing ventilation difficulties. Primary closure was defined as response to treatment after a 3-day course of the assigned drug. Secondary closure was defined as response to treatment after two courses or a total of 6 days of treatment with the assigned drug. Tertiary closure was defined as response to treatment after switching to the other drug in the trial after failure of two courses of treatment.</p><p>During the study period, all infants received the same fluid and enteral feeding protocol. They all started at 80&#x02009;ml/kg/day, which was increased daily in increments of 20&#x02009;ml/kg/day. If the PDA required treatment, fluid administration was kept at a maximum of 120&#x02009;ml/kg/day until the end of the treatment. Feeding was started on day 1 or 2 at 20&#x02009;ml/kg/day according to the availability of breast milk.

compared oral paracetamol and oral ibuprofen for the treatment of PDA in premature infants. Prior to the present study, three randomized studies were published.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr19-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> Although our study examined a relatively lower number of patients, it was conducted using very strict diagnostic and treatment criteria. Echocardiography was performed based on symptoms or age. When infants were asymptomatic, they were screened between days 3 and 5 of life. Screening asymptomatic newborns before day 3 of life can lead to unnecessary treatment of a potentially spontaneously closing ductus. Additionally, screening should not be performed later than day 5 of age because this might affect the response to therapy. However, later detection of PDA in asymptomatic newborns might also reflect an insignificant ductus that may not require treatment. Because symptoms were not considered in the previously published studies, we surmise that echocardiography was performed for screening regardless of age. <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3-0300060517722698">Table 3</xref> summarizes the differences between the present study and the three previously published studies.</p><p>In the present study, the rate of any PDA was 42% and the rate of hsPDA was 28%; both are lower than previously reported rates.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="bibr18-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr19-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> This difference may reflect the timing of the screening and treatment criteria.

Because most PDAs were closed after a 3-day course of the assigned drug, it might be more advisable to treat PDA for 3 days and then confirm failure of treatment before extending the duration of therapy to avoid further side effects of the medication. Tertiary closure was accomplished in one patient randomized to the ibuprofen group whose PDA failed to close after two courses of ibuprofen and closed after switching to paracetamol. Failure of a PDA to close after a 6-day course of either medication should not discourage treating physicians from trying the other medication before sending the infant to surgery.</p><p>Data on the safety of paracetamol have been reported, and little evidence of side effects has been found.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> None of the infants in the present study showed any signs of hepatic toxicity. Ibuprofen has milder vasoconstrictive side effects than other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Mild elevation of blood urea nitrogen and insignificant gastrointestinal symptoms were reported in a previous study.<sup><xref rid="bibr22-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></sup> In our study, the included neonates did not show any significant elevation in the blood urea nitrogen concentration or any gastrointestinal side effects. There were no differences in the neonatal complications between the paracetamol and ibuprofen groups as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2-0300060517722698">Table 2</xref>.</p><p>Long-term safety data of paracetamol and ibuprofen are scarce. A follow-up study of one trial investigating the neurodevelopmental outcomes of children who received oral ibuprofen and oral paracetamol at 18 to 24 months of age showed no difference between the two groups.<sup><xref rid="bibr23-0300060517722698" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup></p><p>We conclude that both oral ibuprofen and oral paracetamol are safe and effective in treating PDA in premature infants. Implementing fluid and feeding protocols might help to decrease both the complications of the PDA and the side effects of the treatment medication. This study included a small number of patients. Multicenter studies are needed to recruit adequate numbers of patients within a reasonable period of time.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the patients&#x02019; parents for their help and cooperation.
