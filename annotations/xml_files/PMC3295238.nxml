Inclusion criteria were: legal age, left coronary artery segment with &#x02264;40% area stenosis (index artery), and no vasodilation of index artery upon acetylcholine infusion. Patients with at least one segment of the index artery without vasodilation on acetylcholine (visual inspection) were eligible. Main exclusion criteria were: myocardial infarction (MI) within 2 weeks or unstable angina (Braunwald class IIIb troponin positive), stroke, peripheral revascularization or major surgery within 3 months, uncontrolled diabetes, symptomatic hypotension or uncontrolled hypertension, left ventricular ejection fraction &#x0003c;40%, creatinine &#x0003e;200 &#x000b5;mol/L, transaminases greater than three times ULN, history of liver or gastrointestinal diseases, and calcium channel blocker treatment for &#x0003e;2 months prior to inclusion.

After coronary angiography and/or PCI, an infusion catheter was positioned in a proximal segment of the left anterior descending or circumflex coronary artery with luminal narrowing &#x0003c;40%. Acetylcholine (Miochol, Ciba Vision, Basel, Switzerland) was infused at 2 mL/min for 3 min in the following order: (1&#x02013;3) acetylcholine 0.36, 3.6, and 18 &#x000b5;g/ml; (4) isotonic saline; and finally (5) a bolus of 250 &#x000b5;g nitroglycerine was injected. At the end of each infusion, heart rate and blood pressure were recorded and angiography performed with non-ionic contrast medium. Finally, an IVUS examination was made.</p><p>Planned treatment duration was 18&#x02013;24 months. At the end of the treatment, patients underwent catheterization after withdrawal of study medication for 2&#x02013;3 days and other cardiovascular drugs for 24 h as at the baseline study. The X-ray tube and catheter were placed in identical positions and the IVUS catheter was placed at the same anatomical landmarks as at baseline. The protocol was then repeated in the index artery.</p><p>Patients were seen in the clinic after 2 weeks, 1, 6, 12, and 18 months. Ambulatory blood pressures were taken with a sphygmomanometer. Clinical chemistry and haematology were analysed centrally (Institute for Clinical Chemistry, University Hospital of Freiburg, Germany). Cholesterol was determined enzymatically (CHOD-PAP method, Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). HDL-cholesterol was determined with a homogenous HDL-C assay (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), and LDL-cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald formula.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Study outcomes</title><p>The primary endpoint was the effect of nifedipine compared with placebo on acetylcholine-induced coronary vascular response at the highest dose of acetylcholine applied both at baseline and follow-up. The secondary endpoint was the effect of nifedipine compared with placebo on the percentage change in plaque volume as assessed by intravascular ultrasound.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Treatments and randomization</title><p>The protocol was designed as a randomized, double-blind, double dummy study with three treatment arms: cerivastatin 0.2 mg/day, cerivastatin 0.8 mg/day, or cerivastatin 0.8 mg/day plus nifedipine GITS 30&#x02013;60 mg/day.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C22">22</xref></sup> After 294 patients had been randomized, cerivastatin was withdrawn from the market due to untoward effects.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C24">24</xref></sup> The study was therefore modified to continue to investigate the effects of nifedipine GITS 30&#x02013;60 mg/day vs. placebo on top of lipid lowering therapy with a statin according to current guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C26">26</xref></sup> Thus, patients randomized before withdrawal of cerivastatin who gave informed consent to continue their participation were continued in their previous treatment arm minus cerivastatin&#x02014;resulting in a 2:1 distribution of the patients on placebo and nifedipine, respectively. New patients were therefore randomized to placebo or nifedipine on a 1:2 ratio in order to get balanced samples in the two treatment arms. One hundred and twenty-three of the originally enrolled patients (42% of randomized patients) re-entered the study. Another 149 patients were randomized after restart leading to an evaluable population of 226 patients. The exposure time to nifedipine averaged 622 days (SD: &#x000b1; 82 days; range: 488&#x02013;853 days).</p><p>A pre-prepared randomization list for each centre was generated by sponsor's statistician with block size 6 and no stratifications.

Patients randomized into the original study and who wanted to continue kept their allocation number without breaking the randomization code.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Assessment of coronary artery diameter</title><p>Angiograms were analysed at a core lab (Cardiology, Medical School, Hannover, Germany). Readers were blinded to patients' identity and to treatment arm. In the index artery 2&#x02013;7 (mean 3) segments distal to the infusion catheter were measured using CMS edge-detection algorithm (MEDIS, Leiden, The Netherlands<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C27">27</xref></sup>). Each segment was identified by anatomical landmarks according to AHA guidelines to facilitate identification at follow-up. Mean diameters were measured at baseline and after each acetylcholine and nitroglycerine infusion. Coronary responses were expressed as percent change from baseline of the acetylcholine-induced change in mean lumen diameter. The pre-defined target segment for the main comparison was the one with the most pronounced vasoconstriction at any acetylcholine dose at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>IVUS imaging procedure</title><p>The IVUS study was performed after acetylcholine infusions. Intracoronary nitroglycerine (0.1&#x02013;0.2 mg) was given and the IVUS catheter positioned in the target vessel. Two different IVUS systems were used: 2.9 F 30 MHz Ultra Cross, Scimed, Boston Scientific, Sunnyvale, CA, USA or a 2.9 F 30 MHz Vision Five-64 F/X Endosonics, Rancho Cordova, CA, USA. In each patient, the same catheter type was used at baseline and follow-up. The position of the IVUS catheter was controlled with fluoroscopy. The imaging transducer of the IVUS catheter was placed distal to a major side branch of the target vessel and the position was documented. Anatomic orientation was also guided by spoken comments during the IVUS study. IVUS pullback was mechanically done at 0.5 mm/s. Images, electrocardiogram, and comments during the pullback were recorded on S-VHS videotape.</p><p>At follow-up, IVUS examinations were repeated to accurately match the coronary segment recorded at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Analysis of IVUS images</title><p>The tapes were analysed by the core laboratory (D.F.) at Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany according to the clinical expert consensus documentation standards for the acquisition, measurement, and reporting of IVUS of the American College of Cardiology.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C28">28</xref></sup> Experienced investigators blinded to patients' identity and treatment allocation reviewed baseline and follow-up images. Calibration was performed with grid marks encoded in the images. One image per second was analysed. Using computerized planimetry (TapeMeasure, Indec Inc., Mountain View, CA, USA), borders of the vessel lumen and of the external elastic membrane (EEM) were identified and cross-sectional area (CSA) measured. Atheroma CSA was calculated by EEM CSA minus lumen CSA for each image. Total atheroma volume was computed as the average atheroma CSA from all analysed slices of the segment multiplied by segment length. From this, total lumen volume and total EEM volume were derived. The secondary efficacy parameter, percent change in atheroma volume after 18&#x02013;24 months of treatment, was defined as:

Nifedipine lowered blood pressure and had minor effects on lipids, but markedly improved coronary endothelial function with only a small effect on plaque progression.</p><p>In ENCORE I,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C16">16</xref></sup> the so far largest clinical trial investigating endothelial dysfunction in CAD with 250 patients, we have previously found a pronounced effect of the L-type calcium channel antagonist nifedipine on coronary endothelial function after 6 month, while the HMG-coenzyme reductase inhibitor cerivastatin had only marginal effects. The latter finding was in line with CARATS that used simvastatin in the same patient population.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C19">19</xref></sup> However, when considering not just the most constricting segment but all analysed coronary arteries, there was a significant effect of the combination of nifedipine and cerivastatin compared with placebo in the ENCORE I trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C16">16</xref></sup> Thus, it appeared that in contrast to studies in the forearm circulation of patients with hypercholesterolaemia,<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C18">18</xref></sup> coronary endothelial dysfunction is more difficult to reverse and/or may require longer treatment periods than in other vascular beds with little atherosclerosis. Furthermore, based on ENCORE I and CARATS it remained unclear whether improving endothelial dysfunction would translate into a reduced atherosclerotic burden in the coronary circulation.</p><p>To that end ENCORE II was designed. Originally, the study involved three groups of patients, i.e. (i) a low statin dose group (cerivastatin 0.2 mg/day), (ii) a high statin dose group (cerivastatin 0.8 mg/day), and (iii) a group treated with a combination of high dose cerivastatin and nifedipine.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C22">22</xref></sup> The withdrawal of cerivastatin from the market<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C24">24</xref></sup> forced a redesign of the trial after almost 300 patients had been randomized. It was decided that patients who consented to continued participation after the redesign would be restarted on either nifedipine or placebo on top of a statin according to current guidelines.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C26">26</xref></sup> Finally, a robust patient population exposed to the study drug for a prolonged period of time, ranging from 488 to 853 days was available for final analysis.</p><p>On nifedipine, blood pressure was lower than on placebo by 5.8/2.1 mmHg, very much in line with the ACTION trial.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C29">29</xref></sup> Obviously, this change may in part account for the reduction in acetylcholin-induced vasoconstriction.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C30">30</xref></sup> LDL cholesterol was lower and HDL higher on nifedipine compared to placebo. As this effect on lipids was not observed in other studies with nifedipine, it could be a play of chance. It is unlikely that these changes contributed to the improvement in vasomotion since much larger changes in lipids observed in CARAT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C19">19</xref></sup> and in ENCORE I<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C16">16</xref></sup> did not lead to a significant improvement in vasomotion. Other laboratory parameters were not affected by the treatment.</p><p>The primary efficacy parameter of ENCORE II was the percent difference in the change of mean luminal diameter in response to acetylcholine after 2 years on placebo or nifedipine. The target segment was the most constricting coronary segment at baseline. Study drugs were discontinued before the follow-up study to assure that long-term and not short-term effects were analysed. Coronary vasoconstriction induced by acetylcholine averaged 25% at baseline, in line with ENCORE I.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C16">16</xref></sup> When compared with placebo, nifedipine led to a robust 18% reduction of the paradoxical vasoconstriction to acetylcholine no matter whether all patients or only those enrolled after restart were considered. Thus, these results confirm the shorter ENCORE I trial and demonstrate that a controlled release formulation of nifedipine persistently improves coronary endothelial function up to 2 years. In the ENCORE studies nifedipine in the controlled release form, GITS, was used. They provide a plasma level with little variation over 24&#x02013;36 h as long as the GITS is present in the GI-tract. However, as soon as the GITS is either empty or has left the bowel nifedipine is cleared from the plasma with the normal half life of about 2 h.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C31">31</xref></sup> That is, since the effects on vasomotion in our study were measured 48&#x02013;72 h after last intake of study medication, the chronic L-type channel blockade appears to favourably affect the biology of diseased human coronary arteries. The improvement in vasomotion may be important for the anti-ischaemic effects of calcium blockers and their ability to reduce hospitalizations for CAD.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C29">29</xref></sup></p><p>The secondary efficacy parameter of the ENCORE II trial was the percentage change in atheroma volume after 2 years assessed by intracoronary ultrasound.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C28">28</xref></sup> At baseline, atheroma volume in the target artery in all patients averaged 148 mm<sup>3</sup>. This is less than in other trials on atherosclerotic lesions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C32">32</xref></sup> Indeed, in ENCORE II we investigated a target artery with less than 40% stenosis. With nifedipine progression was less (1.0%) compared with placebo (1.9%) but the difference was not statistically significant. These results are in line with those seen with amlodipine in CAMELOT.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C33">33</xref></sup> These findings confirm that coronary atherosclerosis is essentially progressive in nature. Thus, although in INTACT<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C34">34</xref></sup> which used angiographic criteria nifedipine led to a reduction in new coronary lesions, ENCORE II as well as CAMELOT using a more sensitive technique allowing for quantitative measurement of plaque volume suggest that clinically anti-atherosclerotic effects of calcium blockers are less pronounced than under experimental conditions.<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="EHP151C36">36</xref></sup> A third efficacy parameter of interest would have been flow reserve as an index of microvascular dysfunction. It was measured with the flow wire in the ENCORE I study, but we could not detect any change in the flow reserve after 6 months treatment despite substantial reduction in lipid levels and a marked effect of nifedipine on vasomotion (unpublished). For this reason, we did not do it in the present study.</p><p>In summary, the ENCORE II study confirmed pronounced endothelial dysfunction as assessed by acetylcholine in a large patient population with stable CAD and demonstrates that the L-type calcium channel blocker nifedipine in a long-acting formulation is able to persistently improve the functional abnormality but with no significant effect on the progression of plaque volume.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Investigators</title><p>T.F.L., Universit&#x000e4;tsSpital, Z&#x000fc;rich, Switzerland; T.M., Universit&#x000e4;tsklinikum Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany; K.O.B., Kreiskrankenhaus Waldbr&#x000f6;l, Waldbr&#x000f6;l, Germany; P.
