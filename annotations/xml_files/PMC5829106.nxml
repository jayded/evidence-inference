We could show that the use of stabilization medium <italic>prior</italic> to cell isolation may have a positive effect on the success rate of hCEC cultures from single research-grade donor corneas by allowing growth of otherwise possibly not successful cultures and by improving their proliferative rate. hCEC were obtained from corneo-scleral rims of 7 discarded human research-grade cornea pairs. The Descemet membrane&#x02013;endothelium (DM&#x02013;EC) sheets of each pair were assigned to 2 experimental conditions: (1) immediate cell isolation after peeling, and (2) storage of the DM&#x02013;EC sheet in a growth factor-depleted culture medium (i.e. stabilization medium) for up to 6&#x000a0;days <italic>prior</italic> to cell isolation. hCEC isolated by enzymatic digestion were then induced to proliferate on pre-coated culture plates. The success rate of primary cultures established from single donor corneas were higher for DM&#x02013;EC sheets kept in stabilization medium before cell isolation. All cultures (7/7) initiated from stabilized DM&#x02013;EC sheets were able to proliferate up to the third passage, while only 4 out of 7 cultures initiated from freshly peeled DM&#x02013;EC sheets reached the third passage. In addition, for the 4 successful paired cultures we observed a faster growth rate if the DM&#x02013;EC sheet was pre-stabilized prior to cell isolation (13.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.8 vs 18.5&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.5&#x000a0;days, <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.05).

Because of the limited proliferation capacity of hCEC in vivo (Schultz et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">1984</xref>), replacement of diseased or damaged endothelium by healthy donor cells by means of corneal transplantation, is currently the only effective treatment option to restore patients&#x02019; vision (Engelmann et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004</xref>). Over the last decade, corneal transplantation for treating endothelial disease, has swiftly advanced from full-thickness penetrating keratoplasty, to the more selective endothelial keratoplasty techniques. Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) is the most selective of these techniques to date and specifically replaces the recipient&#x02019;s diseased endothelium and Descemet membrane (DM) by a healthy donor DM&#x02013;endothelium (DM&#x02013;EC) sheet (Melles and Dapena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2014</xref>; Melles et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2006</xref>). Although this method has several advantages over traditional penetrating keratoplasty (shortens the recovery time, reduces the risk of inflammation and graft rejection), one of its limitations is the shortage of high quality healthy donor tissue. This has led to considerable interest in the development of new strategies to increase the pool of available donor tissue, such as the introduction of hemi- and quarter-DMEK (Gerber-Hollbach et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">2016</xref>; Muller et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2017</xref>), in which the donor DM&#x02013;EC is divided in 2 and 4 pieces, respectively, allowing a much more efficient use of donor tissue.</p><p id="Par3">Transplantation of in vitro expanded cultured hCEC from healthy donor corneas, would be an alternative approach that could possibly solve donor tissue shortage (Choi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">2010</xref>; Koizumi et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">2012</xref>). In most in vitro culture protocols, hCEC isolated from several donor corneas are pooled together and induced to proliferate (Nakahara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>; Okumura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>). However, results have been variable and often with limited success (Peh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">2011a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">b</xref>). In addition, this approach might not be suitable for future clinical application, because of lack of donor traceability and increased antigen load that would significantly increase the risk of allograft rejection. Therefore, we aimed to culture hCEC from single donor corneas. However, one of the main challenges here is the establishment of a reproducible protocol for the in vitro propagation, since the proliferative capacity of hCEC is influenced by many factors including cell density, and this may be lower than required when isolating hCEC from one single donor cornea. A low hCEC density at initiation of culture may induce endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition and might have a general negative impact on morphology and proliferation in vitro (Peh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>).</p><p id="Par4">In a recent report by Peh et al., a dual media culture approach before passaging cultured hCEC was described, in which a serum-supplemented medium was shown to prevent endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition of hCEC expanded in proliferative medium and to conserve hCEC morphology in vitro (Peh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>). Based on this, we hypothesized that preserving the entire DM&#x02013;EC sheet prior to hCEC isolation in a similar serum-supplemented medium with no added growth factors (stabilization medium) would be beneficial for culturing hCEC from single donor corneas (i.e. without pooling several donor corneas to establish a culture). To minimize the effect of donor variation, we chose a paired donor cornea approach in which hCEC of one cornea of each pair were immediately isolated after peeling the DM&#x02013;EC sheet, whereas the DM&#x02013;EC sheet of the contralateral cornea was kept in stabilization medium for 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;days prior to hCEC isolation. The success of establishing stable hCEC cultures as well as their growth rates were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Materials</title><p id="Par5">Dulbecco&#x02019;s modified eagle medium (DMEM), fetal bovine serum (FBS), Dulbecco&#x02019;s phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), TrypLE&#x02122; Express (TE), ascorbic acid 2-phosphate, collagenase from <italic>Clostridium histolyticum</italic> (Type A), paraformaldehyde (PFA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), 4&#x02032;,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), and Triton X-100 were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Chemistry BV (Zwijndrecht, The Netherlands).

The protocol for harvesting the DM&#x02013;EC sheets has been described previously (Groeneveld-van Beek et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2013</xref>; Lie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2008</xref>). Briefly, after decontamination of the globes, corneo-scleral rims were excised within 36&#x000a0;h post-mortem and stored in preservation medium (CorneaMax, Eurobio, Courtaboeuf, France) at 31&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until further processing. To peel the DM&#x02013;EC sheet, corneo-scleral rims were placed endothelial-side-up on a custom made holder with a suction cup. DM&#x02013;EC was then stained with 0.04% Trypan Blue solution for 10&#x000a0;s to visualize Schwalbe&#x02019;s line. DM&#x02013;EC including trabecular meshwork was loosened over 360&#x000b0;. By holding the trabecular meshwork with fine forceps and making gentle centripetal movements, the DM&#x02013;EC sheet was carefully peeled from the posterior stroma. After removing the trabecular meshwork, a &#x02018;Descemet-roll&#x02019; formed spontaneously with the endothelium laying on the outer side. The DM&#x02013;EC sheets obtained from each pair as described above were processed further by (1) immediate isolation of hCEC from the DM&#x02013;EC sheet (non-stabilized hCEC), and (2) by storing the entire contralateral DM&#x02013;EC sheet in stabilization medium (SM, Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>) (stabilized-hCEC) first for 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;days before hCEC isolation.<table-wrap id="Tab2"><label>Table&#x000a0;2</label><caption><p>Supplemented media used in the culture of human corneal endothelial cells</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Basal medium</th><th align="left">Serum (%)</th><th align="left">Growth factors and supplements</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">[PM]<break/>DMEM (Shima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>)</td><td char="." align="char">15</td><td align="left">2&#x000a0;mM&#x000a0;<sc>l</sc>-glutamine<break/>2&#x000a0;ng/ml bFGF<break/>0.3&#x000a0;mM <sc>l</sc>-ascorbic acid 2-phosphate<break/>10,000 U-ml pen/strep</td></tr><tr><td align="left">[SM]<break/>DMEM (Peh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2015</xref>)</td><td char="." align="char">15</td><td align="left">10,000 U-ml pen/strep</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p>

</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par15">To this day, an impressive amount of protocols for isolation and proliferation of hCEC have been proposed, with a main focus on media composition and use of various specific growth factors (Hoppenreijs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">1994</xref>; Shima et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2011</xref>). However, isolation and proliferation of hCEC in vitro from human donors remains challenging, especially when cultures have to be established from hCEC which derive from just one donor cornea and the baseline parameters of this research-grade cornea are not optimal. We hypothesized that the success rate of establishing cell cultures of hCEC isolated from single research-grade corneas could be improved by storing freshly peeled DM&#x02013;EC sheets for 4&#x02013;6&#x000a0;days in a stabilization medium prior to cell isolation. In this study, we found that 100% of the hCEC cultures initiated from stabilized DM&#x02013;EC sheets propagated well over two passages whereas cultivated hCEC isolated from the contralateral cornea and expanded immediately after DM&#x02013;EC sheet harvesting had a success rate of 57%.</p><p id="Par16">We observed that the initial cell concentration before seeding was higher for hCEC isolated from non-stabilized DM&#x02013;EC sheets than for hCEC isolated from stabilized DM&#x02013;EC sheets. The most likely explanation for this result is that our stabilization medium affects the presence of viable and non-viable cells. It is known that both the length of organ culture storage time of the corneo-scleral rim (Albon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2000</xref>; Armitage and Easty <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1997</xref>; Borderie et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">1998</xref>; Pels and Schuchard <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1983</xref>; Gauthier et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2016</xref>), and mechanical stress caused by peeling the DM&#x02013;EC sheet may increase the number of non-viable hCEC (Bhogal et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">2016</xref>; Marty et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2016</xref>). This may imply that the initially higher cell concentration before seeding for the non-stabilized hCEC, i.e. isolated immediately after peeling, measured a population of both viable and non-viable cells. The lower cell concentration for the stabilized hCEC may then be explained by a &#x02018;loss&#x02019; of non-viable cells during the stabilization period with mainly viable cells remaining on the DM&#x02013;EC sheet. Thus, we may find a higher concentration of hCEC after isolating them from non-stabilized DM&#x02013;EC sheets compared to stabilized DM&#x02013;EC sheets because of the presence of non-viable cells in the former which are lacking in the latter.</p><p id="Par17">It is known that non-viable cells may negatively impact the cells in their immediate vicinity (Gregory et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2009</xref>). Since in vitro cell cultures have no mechanism to remove non-viable cells, in the non-stabilized cultures the behavior of viable hCEC may therefore have been negatively influenced by their non-viable neighbors. This also suggests that by storing the DM&#x02013;EC sheet for some days in stabilization medium, we were able to isolate and culture a more viable hCEC population. Therefore, it is of the utmost importance to remove the apoptotic cells before seeding the cells, as they produce various factors that may negatively impact their viable neighbors (Gregory and Pound <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2010</xref>). This may explain the improved growth characteristics of stabilized hCEC compared to non-stabilized hCEC. In three pairs where we could not establish a culture from non-stabilized hCEC, we were able to culture stabilized hCEC from the contralateral cornea over several passages with normal morphology and expression of markers characteristic of human corneal endothelium: Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATP and ZO-1.</p><p id="Par18">It is well known that the conditions that may lead to a successful hCEC culture are quite precarious; i.e. an extended storage time before isolation and culture, a high donor age (Joyce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Joyce and Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>), and a low yield of hCEC at the start of culture may all negatively affect hCEC propagation (Peh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2013</xref>). Because of the latter, in most protocols, hCEC are isolated from several research-grade corneas and mixed at initiation of culture (Nakahara et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">2013</xref>; Okumura et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">2015</xref>), which may cause the results to be confounded by donor-to-donor variability. More importantly, this approach is not suitable for eventual clinical application of cultured hCEC because of lack of tissue traceability (Strong and Shinozaki <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2010</xref>), and a possible higher risk of allograft rejection because the hCEC originated from different donors. Here, we show that with prior stabilization of DM&#x02013;EC sheets from research-grade single donor corneas with extended storage time before culture (average 16&#x000a0;days) and a high donor age (average 69&#x000a0;years), we still were able to establish a successful culture in all cases, which was not possible for the non-stabilized contralateral corneas. This result is important for future clinical application of cultured hCEC. Because tissue traceability, and therefore, safety are maintained, the risk of rejection of the cultured hCEC is reduced and even with &#x02018;unfavorable&#x02019; parameters, hCEC may be cultured successfully.</p><p id="Par19">However, it should be pointed out that the study included only a small number of paired corneas (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;7) of relatively old donors. Therefore it would be interesting to assess the effect of stabilization medium on growing hCEC in vitro from a larger number of donors, including donors with an age younger than 50&#x000a0;years since the latter have been shown to propagate better in culture than hCEC from older donors (Joyce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2012</xref>; Joyce and Zhu <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">2004</xref>). Furthermore, viability assays performed on freshly peeled DM&#x02013;EC and during culture might enable quantification of viable and non-viable hCEC at any stage during the investigation and might confirm our hypothesis in more detail. Because a Trypan blue staining is not able to discriminate between apoptotic and dead cells (Perry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">1997</xref>), a thorough investigation of various staining methods is required in order to enable the qualitative assessment of the overall cell population prior to cell seeding.</p><p id="Par20">In conclusion, we report a novel straightforward and practical manner to successfully culture hCEC derived from a single donor cornea. This procedure has obvious potential in improving in vitro hCEC culture protocols and may aid in the future clinical application of cultured hCEC for corneal endothelial diseases.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The project leading to this study has received funding from the European Union&#x02019;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under Grant Agreement No. 667400 (ARREST BLINDNESS Consortium).</p></ack><notes notes-type="COI-statement"><title>Compliance with ethical standards</title><sec id="FPar1"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p id="Par21">Dr. Melles is a consultant for DORC International/Dutch Ophthalmic USA and SurgiCube International.
