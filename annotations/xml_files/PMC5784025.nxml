We aimed to investigate the effects of antihypertensive agents on central and cerebral haemodynamic parameters in hypertensive patients with ischaemic stroke. The Fimasartan, Atenolol, and Valsartan On haemodynamic paRameters (FAVOR) study was conducted in a prospective, double-blinded manner. One hundred five patients were randomly administered atenolol, valsartan, or fimasartan during 12 weeks. We measured brachial, central, cerebral haemodynamic parameters and plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels at baseline and after 12-week. Baseline haemodynamic parameters were balanced among the three groups. Even with similar brachial BP reduction, significantly lower central systolic BP (atenolol; 146.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;18.8 vs. valsartan; 133.5&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;20.7 vs. fimasartan; 133.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;19.8&#x02009;mmHg, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>0</italic>.<italic>017</italic>) and augmentation index values (89.8&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;13.2 vs. 80.6&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;9.2 vs. 79.2&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;11.6%; <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;<italic>0</italic>.<italic>001</italic>) were seen in the angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) groups.

In the aspect of other antihypertensive class, some stroke neurologists have concerned about the use of calcium-channel blockers (CCB) due to the potential redistribution of cerebral blood flow by the vasodilatory reaction<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. Beta-blockers, despite limited effect on prevention of cardiovascular events compared with ARB<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>, still have been considered for lowering BP due to their minimal influence on cerebral perfusion especially in acute period<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.

Central pressure could be affected by age, sex, heart rate, or additional systemic diseases. Also, importantly, antihypertensive agents are known to have different effects on central pressure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.

Fifty-one patients were excluded; 22 uncontrolled hypertension, 19 severe stroke, 10 refuse participation. General demographics and clinical characteristics for the patients were investigated and collected, and their stroke subtype was determined. All patients received standard stroke treatment at a comprehensive stroke unit until they became neurologically stable. Study candidates were screened at a general ward from 7 to 28 days after symptom. Patients were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to treatment with atenolol, valsartan, or fimasartan by a computer generated block card randomisation procedure. Treatment regimen to reach at target brachial BP (&#x0003c;140/90&#x02009;mmHg) was designated on the basis of the previous studies with a single dose scheme: 50&#x02009;mg atenolol; 80&#x02009;mg valsartan; and 60&#x02009;mg fimasartan. The study drugs were provided in the tablet form of same size, shape and colour containing atenolol, valsartan or fimasartan according to randomisation group. Treatment assignment was blinded in all participants, patients and their caregiver throughout the trial. After enrolment, patients took the assigned drug at the same time each day after their morning meal. When the target BP was not reached during follow up period, the drug dose was doubled. No other antihypertensive agents were permitted throughout the study. This trial was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Ajou University Medical Centre.

Deleterious vascular remodeling has been observed in the retina<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref></sup> and kidney<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref></sup> in hypertensive patients, which is explained by an increase of vascular resistance. Prior experimental<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup> and clinical studies<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref></sup> show that treatment with RAS blockades would be beneficial in not only cardiovascular disease but also in cerebrovascular disease. Cerebral ischaemia induces the overexpression of angiotensin II type 2 (AT<sub>2</sub>) receptor, which can lead to cerebral vasodilatation and other pleotropic effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref></sup>. Augmentation of this pathway can improve vasodilatory capacity and vascular reserve in the brain. Pulsatility index (PI) has been used as a noninvasive surrogate of the relevant arterial impedance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Therefore, the attenuation of cerebral pulsatility in our dataset might be a reflection of reinforcing the AT<sub>2</sub> pathway through selective AT<sub>1</sub> receptor block by ARBs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref></sup>. It is consistent with the previous experiments that showed selective RAS alterations in cerebral tissue<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par21">Plasma NT-proBNP level is attributed to increases in left ventricular stretch and cardiac afterload<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref></sup>, and it is an independent predictor of outcome in heart failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref></sup> and coronary artery disease<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref></sup>. In hypertensive patients, the role of BNP was not clear, several studies showed that RAS blockades decreased plasma BNP levels in patients without heart failure<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref></sup>. Our data demonstrated that fimasartan significantly decreased NT-proBNP levels as compared with atenolol and valsartan. There was also a significant association with the levels of NT-proBNP and AIx in this trial, which is consistent with the previous research<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. Moreover, there seems to be an associative trend between NT-proBNP level and overall contour change of the arterial reflection wave, both of which can be due to RAS alteration, even in a short-term ARBs administration. Therefore, our results&#x02013;namely, concurrent decreases of central BP, arterial reflection, cerebral pulsatilities and plasma NT-proBNP&#x02013;can be a surrogate evidence that ARB can be a more favourable choice for stroke patients with hypertension. Fimasartan, a recently developed selective AT<sub>1</sub> receptor blocker, is a pyrimidin-4(3&#x02009;H)-one derivative of losartan with the imidazole ring replaced<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref></sup>. This molecular change might enable higher binding affinity with longer half-life of 14.0 to 17.9&#x02009;hours for AT<sub>1</sub>, and several preclinical studies have shown target organ-protecting effects<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref></sup>. In addition, a recent randomised-controlled trial showed that fimasartan had better 24-hour BP profiles than valsartan due to different pharmacokinetics<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref></sup>. In this context, our data addresses that effective and sustained BP reduction in fimasartan group, which might influence on central vessel and targeted-end organ protections.</p><p id="Par22">This study has several limitations. Although our study is solidly based on central haemodynamic and biochemical surrogate markers, it has to be cautiously interpreted, as our conclusion may be hypothetical. Second, our investigation was based on non-invasive methods of haemodynamic measurement. Noninvasive measurements can be influenced by various factors including age, gender, height, and heart rate, therefore, its values may be indirect compared to other invasive methods of central and cerebral haemodynamics. However, such non-invasive methods provide easy and practical application to patients with ischaemic stroke and systemic hypertension, and assist in gaining clinical insight into the underlying pathophysiology. Finally, the results should be interpreted cautiously because our study population was relatively small. However, this was the first investigation for evaluating drug class effects under similar brachial BP control in hypertensive patients with ischaemic stroke. In the future, large-scale trial would be required for confirming the observations in this study.</p><p id="Par23">In conclusion, administration of ARBs can be more beneficial on central pressure and cerebral haemodynamic parameters under similar brachial BP control compared to atenolol in patients with ischaemic stroke. This trial supports the view that the benefits of ARB in cardiovascular prevention exist beyond BP lowering and that it provides additional therapeutic advantage for ischaemic stroke patients. In the future, these findings need to be confirmed in large-scaled and long-term trials with clinical outcome measures.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec18"><p>
