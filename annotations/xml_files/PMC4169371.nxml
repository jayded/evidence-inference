</p></sec></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is highly prevalent in northeastern India, particularly the state of Bihar and its bordering areas with Bangladesh and Nepal. The current standards of treatment, namely, miltefosine (oral) and pentavalent antimonials (parenteral) have long treatment durations and are faced with increasing resistance, decreased efficacy, low compliance and safety issues. In this regard, lipid formulations of amphotericin B (AmB) have become an attractive treatment option due to their high efficacy, shorter treatment regimens and favorable safety profiles. This Phase III study evaluated the efficacy and safety of preformed AmB lipid emulsion (ABLE) versus liposomal AmB (LAmB) (both 15 mg/kg single dose infusions) in the treatment of VL. ABLE showed favorable efficacy measured in terms of initial cure at Day 30/45, and overall clinical improvement. ABLE was well tolerated and its adverse event profile was consistent with previously documented findings. Based on the favorable efficacy and safety profile of ABLE, and considering the demographic profile of the population in the endemic region, a single dose treatment may offer advantages in terms of compliance, cost and applicability.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The study was sponsored by Department of Science and Technology Govt. of India.

Kala-azar is a major public health problem in the areas of its prevalence, principally India and its neighbors Bangladesh and Nepal. In India, the disease is highly prevalent in Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal and pockets of eastern Uttar Pradesh. Among these, Bihar is the most affected with &#x0003e;90% of cases <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Perry1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, of which 10% are fatal <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Leishmaniasis1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>.</p><p>Contrary to the severity, few drugs are available for its treatment and are further limited by safety, reduced effectiveness and challenges in administration. Use of pentavalent antimonials, the mainstay of treatment for over 70 years, has been limited by its resistance and toxicities <xref rid="pntd.0003169-vanGriensven1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. In India, almost 65% of previously untreated cases fail to respond promptly or relapse after treatment with antimonials <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. Efficacy of the first-line oral treatment, miltefosine (MF) has declined rapidly over the past decade (final cure rate: 96.7% in 1999, 94% in 2002, 82% in 2007, and 72% in 2011) and is also associated with gastrointestinal side effects <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Bhattacharya1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar2" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>. In addition, owing to its teratogenic effects, treatment with MF may require strict medical monitoring for treating women of child bearing age, which considering current demographic outlook of India is a significant factor <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Paramomycin, an aminoglycoside, had shown 94% cure rate but is associated with systemic hepatic toxicity; the current regimen of 21 daily injections is also a major disadvantage for routine clinical use <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sinha2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>.</p><p>Amphotericin B (AmB), currently a second line drug used for treatment of VL, is highly effective with cure rates of 97%; however, the administration of 15 intravenous injections (i.v.) over 30 days of hospitalization, coupled with infusion- and drug-related adverse effects <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Wasan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, has limited its wide-spread use. Liposomal formulations of AmB (LAmB) are better tolerated and thus preferable to conventional AmB <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar5" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar6" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Educational, social and economic background of patients in endemic areas entails therapy that does not bother patients with cost, undue compliance issues and long treatment duration, making a simplified treatment regimen a need of the hour. Thus, an affordable premixed AmB deoxycholate with lipid emulsion (ABLE) was developed (licensed in India) <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar7" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref> and can be a potential candidate for treatment and elimination in endemic countries.

To eliminate this endemic disease by 2015, a Tripartite Memorandum of Understanding agreement was signed in 2005 by the Governments of India, Nepal and Bangladesh wherein MF monotherapy was introduced as a first-line treatment <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Stauch1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. However, of late, efficacy of MF has been declining steadily (96.7% to 72%) and its teratogenic potential remains a major concern in these areas where women are from low income groups and direct counseling is difficult, which limits its use in settings where the directly observed treatment is possible <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar3" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar4" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003169-denBoer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Other long-term treatment options, namely AmB (15 i.v injections over 30 days), pose a remarkable burden on the patient as well as health infrastructure <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Wasan1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>. Thus, short-course effective treatment regimens are greatly needed for the treatment of VL.</p><p>In this study, in the mITT population, efficacy of single day infusions of ABLE 15 mg/kg/day was satisfactory with an initial cure rate of 95.9% compared with 100% for LAmB. The difference in the initial cure rate was statistically significant between the groups (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.028). However, this should be interpreted with caution, as in field settings LAmB is used as a single bolus dose of 10 mg/kg/day, compared to 15 mg/kg/day as was used in this study. This might have caused differences in the intended exposure to the treatment drug between groups. These results are in line with the results observed in a previous Phase II ABLE study <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar7" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>.</p><p>Weight gain and decrease in spleen size were similar in both groups. The ABLE group showed greater increase in Hb concentration (79.4%) compared to the LAmB group (65.6%). Overall, clinical improvement (Day 30) was comparable (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.6414) between the ABLE (98.9%) and LAmB groups (98.4%). Furthermore, the proportion of patients with no symptoms of relapse or showing no clinical signs of disease (definitive cure) was 85.9% in the ABLE group and 98.4% in the LAmB group.</p><p>The safety and tolerability of ABLE observed over 6 months duration was consistent with the earlier Phase II ABLE studies <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar7" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar8" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Infusion related pyrexia and chills were the most common drug-related adverse events in both groups. These were mainly attributed to non-administration of premedication. However, in the field and in most studies, the patients are given premedication to prevent infusion related reactions <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar9" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>. No patient showed signs and symptoms of nephrotoxicity and hepatotoxicity, which was consistent with results from previous Phase II studies <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar7" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar8" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Thus, the efficacy and safety results indicate that the treatment with ABLE is efficacious and safe.</p><p>Apart from efficacy and safety, which are important aspects of any drug or formulation, secondary aspects such as cost-effectiveness, affordability, better compliance and ease of availability must also be considered to assess the feasibility of its use. The necessity to assess secondary aspects of drug become even more important as VL mainly affects poor and neglected populations in East Africa and the Indian sub-continent <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Chappuis1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It is estimated that illness due to VL may result in loss of income for up to 60% of the total household cost <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Boelaert1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>. Thus, single-dose treatment regimens will not only reduce the hospital cost, but also drastically reduce the economic burden on the family <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Sundar6" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Additionally, it has been proposed that extensive use of AmB and its formulations for treatment of VL may aid in decreasing the incidence of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis, a potential reservoir of disease <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Thakur1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. However, it is necessary to closely monitor and counsel patients about infrequent cases of post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis that tend to occur post-treatment with novel AmB formulations <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Das1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Burza1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>.</p><p>In addition to poor economic conditions, co-infection with human immunodeficiency virus has changed the classical picture of VL in India, particularly in Bihar <xref rid="pntd.0003169-World1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Mathur1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Co-infected patients generally have poor response to the treatment, which leads to frequent relapses and high mortality <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Cota1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. In this context, it is imperative that such patients are diagnosed and treated appropriately through active case detection approaches as co-infected patients tend to transmit more virulent strains of VL.</p><p>In summary, novel formulations of AmB due to its high therapeutic index, short treatment courses and favorable safety profile have become an attractive treatment option <xref rid="pntd.0003169-denBoer1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. However, in India, which bears the highest burden of VL, LAmB is not yet registered and is imported under special license, which can be a limiting factor in its availability. Also, India is not a recipient of the LAmB donation initiative, which may further impact its availability to poorer patients <xref rid="pntd.0003169-Balasegaram1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>. In addition, in India, LAmB is available at a preferential price only in limited quantities through specific treatment channels, thereby limiting its access to several patients infected with the disease. On the other hand, the ABLE formulation has been registered in India and can be supplied in liberal quantities, locally. Thus, favorable efficacy and safety profile, treatment compliance, affordability and availability of ABLE formulation make it a strong candidate for treatment of VL and for inclusion into the VL elimination program.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this study, ABLE 15 mg/kg single bolus was found to be efficacious, safe and well tolerated in patients with VL. In addition, its ancillary properties such as favorable applicability and compliance (due to single dose administration), low cost and unrestricted supply, make it a suitable option for VL treatment in endemic countries.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pntd.0003169.s001"><label>Supporting Information S1</label><caption><p>
