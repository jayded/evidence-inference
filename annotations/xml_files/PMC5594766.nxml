This effect is more exaggerated when the patient has already preexisting diseases mainly coronary artery diseases, myocardial infarction, and intracranial aneurysm. Hence, to decrease this adverse effect of laryngoscopy and intubation, a number of drugs are used such as b-blockers, lignocaine, and opioids. In this study, we are going to study the effect of oral gabapentin, pregabalin, and clonidine for attenuation of the hemodynamic response due to laryngoscopy and intubation.</p><p>Gabapentin is structurally related to neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It is used for controlling seizers and controlling neuropathic pain, restless leg syndrome.</p><p>Clonidine is &#x003b1;<sub>2</sub>-adrenergic agonist. It is used in anesthesia for sedation, anxiolysis, and as adjuvant for regional blocks. It helps in attenuation of hemodynamic effect by blocking the central sympathetic outflow.</p><p>Pregabalin binds to same receptors as gabapentin and has a similar pharmacological profile. It is used for sedation, and anxiolysis is anesthesia.</p><p>The aim of the present study was to evaluate and compare the effect of clonidine and gabapentin and pregabalin in obtunding hemodynamic response to laryngoscopy and intubation in normotensive patients undergoing elective surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>M<sc>ETHODS</sc></title><p>The study was approved by Hospital Ethical Committee, and informed consent from all the participants was obtained. Ninety adult patients between 18 and 60 years are enrolled in the study. Patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Grade-I and Grade-II are included which are posted for elective surgery under general anesthesia. Patients with ASA Grade III and IV, difficult intubation are excluded from the study.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Study design</title><p>It was a prospective, randomized, and double-blind study. Randomization was performed by envelope method. All patients had undergone preanesthetic examination for detailed history, examination, and appropriate investigations. Patients were randomly allocated to three groups of thirty each. Each group received oral drugs 90 min before surgery with sip of water. Group A patients received pregabalin 150mg, Group B patients received gabapentin 900mg and Group C clonidine 200 &#x003bc;g. Pulse oximetry, noninvasive arterial blood pressure, electrocardiogram were the standard monitoring used in the operating room. Intravenous line is taken, and after preoxygenation for 3&#x02013;5 min, propofol 2 mg/kg was used as induction agent followed by succinylcholine 2 mg/kg. Patient is manually ventilated, after that, laryngoscopy and intubation were performed by trained anesthetics. The patient is maintained with oxygen, nitrous oxide, isoflurane, and atracurium thereafter. Sedation score and anxiety score were noted in preanesthetic room.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Anxiety score</title><p>
