In the United States, gastroenteritis accounts for more than 1.5 million pediatric outpatient visits and 200,000 hospitalizations annually<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</sup>. Current recommendations for the treatment of acute gastroenteritis focus primarily on the correction of dehydration and electrolyte abnormalities. Oral rehydration is safe and effective and is the preferred therapy in mild to moderate dehydration, whereas intravenous fluids are recommended in more severe cases<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Vomiting is a common symptom in children with gastroenteritis, but its treatment remains controversial<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</sup>. In the clinical practice antiemetic drugs are frequently used in children with gastroenteritis. A recent retrospective survey retrieved data from 4 national and international databases showed that prescription of antiemetic medication varied considerably<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>It is also a controversial topic in treatment of pediatric gastroenteritis. Antiemetics are commonly prescribed by physicians<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]</sup>, in particular, between 2% and 23% of children with gastroenteritis received prescriptions for antiemetic medications<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</sup> and many physicians believe that vomiting is a contraindication to oral rehydration therapy (ORT)<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Multiple medications have been used in an attempt to limit vomiting and facilitate oral rehydration but have not gained acceptance, because of their limited success and high rates of complicating adverse effects<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</sup>. According to previous studies administering promethazine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide can cause extrapyramidal reactions, lethargy, respiratory depression, and cardiac dysrhythmias<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>. Ondansetron is a 5-hydroxytryptamine subtype 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonist which has been documented to be an effective anti-emetic in preventing and treating Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PNOV) with few side effects<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Orally disintegrating ondansetron has been shown to be effective in preventing chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>. It has an excellent safety profile and is well tolerated by patients<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</sup>. Recently ondansetron has been studied for a possible use in acute gastroenteritis in children. Although it has shown great effectiveness in reducing vomiting when compared with other antiemetic drugs or placebo, it causes an increased incidence of diarrhea. Literature documenting ondansetron usage in gastroenteritis is limited and most studies focus on its application as an intravenous medication.</p><p>The aim of this study was to determine the effect of oral ondansetron in decreasing the vomiting due to acute gastroenteritis in children.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="S0002"><title>Subjects and Methods</title><p>Our study was double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial to compare the effect of a single dose oral ondansetron and placebo in decreasing vomiting due to acute gastroenteritis in children. We attempted to determine whether the use of oral ondansetron would facilitate ORT tolerance in dehydrated vomiting children with gastroenteritis and decrease the need for intravenous rehydration therapy. This investigation was conducted in the emergency department of Children's Hospital in Rasht, Iran between September 1, 2010 and March 1, 2011. The Ethics Committee of Guilan University of Medical Sciences approved the study.</p><p>We hypothesized that patients receiving ondansetron would tolerate ORT by oral rehydration solution (ORS) better than patients receiving placebo and lower proportion of them would require intravenous hydration therapy.</p><p>We enrolled a sample of patients with the clinical diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis and dehydration. All children with symptoms of gastroenteritis were screened for eligibility by the supervising physician. Specific inclusion criteria were: age between 1 and 10 years, clinical presentation of simple acute gastroenteritis, dehydration, onset of disease in preceding 24 hours prior to the study, at least one episode of vomiting in previous 6 hours, no fever or low grade fever (less than 38.2 &#x000b0;C). Exclusion criteria included: any antiemetic drug usage in last 24 hours, any chronic disease, and alarming signs such as headache, abdominal distention, severe dehydration or shock, severe diarrhea more than one episode in one hour, any previous unfavorable response to 5HT<sub>3</sub> receptor inhibitor drugs and any other situation in which ORT is not recommended.</p><p>After enrollment demographic features and clinical data like patient's name, age, sex, weight, height and telephone number were recorded. We used the World Health Organization protocol (The Treatment of Diarrhea, A manual for physicians and other senior health workers) to classify severity of dehydration and treat patients with ORS which was one of the main differences in our study because of extent of application in many developing and developed countries, our local policy and its feasibility for outpatient setup (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T0001">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="T0001" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Approximate amount of oral rehydration therapy to give in the first 4 hours<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</sup></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" style="background-color: #000080; color:white" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Age</th><th align="center" style="background-color: #000080; color:white" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Less than 4 months</th><th align="center" style="background-color: #000080; color:white" rowspan="1" colspan="1">4&#x02013; 11 months</th><th align="center" style="background-color: #000080; color:white" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12&#x02013; 23 months</th><th align="center" style="background-color: #000080; color:white" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2 &#x02013; 4 years</th><th align="center" style="background-color: #000080; color:white" rowspan="1" colspan="1">5 &#x02013; 14 years</th><th align="center" style="background-color: #000080; color:white" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15 years or older</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" rowspan="1" colspan="1">

Orally disintegrating ondansetron has been shown to be effective in preventing chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</sup>.

The oral dose was well tolerated and resulted in a reduction of more than 50 percent in both the proportion of children who vomited during oral rehydration and the proportion treated with intravenous fluids<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. In addition, Roslund demonstrated an improved success rate of ORT and a decreased need for intra venous fluid in patients with AGE treated with a single dose of oral ondansetron<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Furthermore, in this survey results showed no difference of vomiting episodes during ED stay and 48-hour follow up in the two groups and no significant reduction in hospital admissions in ondansetron group. However, Roslund et al and Freedman et al demonstrated fewer vomiting episodes in the ondansetron group and both demonstrated a slightly lower admission rate in the ondansetron group,<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Also, Ramoosk found that patients receiving ondansetron had significantly fewer emetic episodes (<italic>P</italic>=.001) and most of them did not vomit at all during the initial observation period in the emergency department (87% versus 65%, <italic>P</italic>=.004); on the other hand, a statistically significant difference was not found during a 48-hour follow-up period. In the ondansetron group, there were fewer admissions and shorter length of stay in hospital<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>According to previous studies traditional antiemetics such as promethazine, prochlorperazine, and metoclopramide reveal limited success and high rates of complicating adverse effects such as extra pyramidal reactions, lethargy, respiratory depression, and cardiac dysrhythmias<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</sup>.</p><p>Ondansetron was well tolerated in our study sample, and as mentioned, no evidence of complications was reported in ondansetron group.

Freedman et al reported a statistically significant increase in diarrhea during the ED stay in patients treated with ondansetron but did not evaluate the incidence of diarrhea during follow-up<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]</sup>. Furthermore, Ramsook et al did not detect a difference in diarrheal episodes during the ED stay but reported a statistically significant increase in diarrheal episodes in the 48 hours after ED discharge<sup>[<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</sup>.
