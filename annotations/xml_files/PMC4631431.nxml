The safety of IV ibuprofen as assessed in ten sponsored clinical studies is presented in this analysis. Overall, 1,752 adult patients have been included in safety and efficacy trials over 11 years; 1,220 of these patients have received IV ibuprofen and 532 received either placebo or comparator medication. The incidence of adverse events (AEs), serious AEs, and changes in vital signs and clinically significant laboratory parameters have been summarized and compared to patients receiving placebo or active comparator drug. Overall, IV ibuprofen has been well tolerated by hospitalized and outpatient patients when administered both prior to surgery and postoperatively as well as for nonsurgical pain or fever. The overall incidence of AEs is lower in patients receiving IV ibuprofen as compared to those receiving placebo in this integrated analysis. Specific analysis of hematological and renal effects showed no increased risk for patients receiving IV ibuprofen. A subset analysis of elderly patients suggests that no dose adjustment is needed in this higher risk population. This integrated safety analysis demonstrates that IV ibuprofen can be safely administered prior to surgery and continued in the postoperative period as a component of multimodal pain management.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>NSAID</kwd><kwd>surgical pain</kwd><kwd>fever</kwd><kwd>perioperative analgesia</kwd><kwd>critical care</kwd><kwd>multimodal pain management</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a well known and long history of use. Oral ibuprofen was approved in the USA over 40 years ago and has been a nonprescription drug for more than 30 years. IV ibuprofen (Caldolor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc., Nashville, TN, USA) was first approved in 2009 for the management of mild to moderate pain, moderate to severe pain in conjunction with narcotics, and for the reduction of fever in adults.<xref rid="b1-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It is the only IV NSAID approved for the treatment of fever in the USA. Since 2002, the safety and effectiveness of IV ibuprofen has been investigated in ten clinical studies, Phases II&#x02013;IV, conducted under a corporate investigational new drug application (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-8-753">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>Two other IV NSAIDs are currently available in the US market, ketorolac tromethamine injection (&#x0201c;ketorolac&#x0201d;, Toradol, Pfizer Inc., New York, NY, USA) and diclofenac sodium injection (&#x0201c;diclofenac&#x0201d;, Dyloject&#x02122;, Hospira Inc., Lake Forest, IL, USA). Ketorolac injection was approved in 1989 for the short-term management of moderately severe, acute pain requiring analgesia at the opioid level.<xref rid="b2-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Ketorolac is contraindicated for use in excess of 5 days, for minor or chronic pain, and for use in pediatric patients. Additional limitations on ketorolac administration include prohibitions against all preoperative use, in patients with active ulcers or who are otherwise at a high risk of bleeding, those with advanced renal impairment, and women who are nursing. Diclofenac sodium injection was approved in December 2014 for the management of mild to moderate pain or moderate to severe pain either alone or in combination with opiates.<xref rid="b3-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Diclofenac is only approved for use in adults and is contraindicated in patients with known moderate to severe renal insufficiency who may become volume depleted. Neither of these IV NSAIDs are indicated for the treatment of fever.</p><p>In general, NSAIDs have analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and antipyretic properties, and their use is associated with recognized gastrointestinal (GI) and cardiovascular (CV) risks which are generally believed to be derived from the relative level of cyclooxygenase 1 (COX1) or COX2 inhibition.<xref rid="b4-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b5-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> All three IV NSAIDs mentioned above are considered nonselective in terms of their COX1 and COX2 inhibition because they are capable of inhibiting both isoforms. However, Warner et al extensively investigated the COX1 and COX2 inhibitory capacity of over 40 NSAIDs using two in vitro assays, and their results permit ranking of these NSAIDs in terms of COX1 preference &#x02013; ketorolac &#x0003e; ibuprofen &#x0003e; diclofenac &#x02013; where ketorolac is the most COX1 selective, diclofenac is weakly COX2 selective (fourfold), and ibuprofen is essentially balanced (nonspecific).<xref rid="b6-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> These in vitro results suggest that ibuprofen may have a preferable safety profile over ketorolac in terms of GI complications and over diclofenac in terms of CV complications.<xref rid="b7-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> This hypothesis is supported by the clinical literature which demonstrates that ketorolac can be as much as fivefold more gastrotoxic than other NSAIDs.<xref rid="b8-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> A meta-analysis of 28 studies pooled the relative risk (RR) of GI complications following usage of individual NSAIDs and found that ibuprofen had one of the most favorable risk profiles (RR =1.8) as compared to diclofenac at 3.3 and ketorolac at 11.5.<xref rid="b9-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Further meta-analysis demonstrated that ibuprofen also had one of the lowest risk ratios for CV events, whereas diclofenac conferred a high risk of CV complications.<xref rid="b10-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> A retrospective chart analysis of 9,658 patients receiving inpatient NSAID therapy concluded that diclofenac and aspirin were the NSAIDs most commonly associated with the emergence of adverse events (AEs).<xref rid="b11-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>Until recently, limited data have been available on the use of IV ibuprofen in hospitalized patients. Additional Phase IV trials have been conducted following the approval of IV ibuprofen by the FDA in 2009. This review presents a cumulative analysis of the clinical safety data available regarding the use of IV ibuprofen for the treatment of pain and fever in hospitalized adults.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Study selection</title><p>The data in this cumulative safety analysis are derived from all published and unpublished, sponsored clinical studies investigating IV ibuprofen (Caldolor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc.) for the treatment of fever and/or pain in adult patients (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-8-753">Table 1</xref>). Eight clinical trials have been published previously. All studies were conducted under an active investigational new drug application and approved by the sites&#x02019; local independent ethics committees. All enrollees were at least 18 years of age, and written informed consent was obtained either directly from the participant or from his/her legally authorized representative.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>In each clinical trial, pain was assessed using a validated 10-point Visual Analog Scale (VAS),<xref rid="b12-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> and fever was defined as a core body temperature of 38&#x000b0;C (100.4&#x000b0;F) or above. Safety was assessed based on the frequency and severity of treatment-emergent AEs as well as changes in vital signs and laboratory parameters. Treatment-emergent AEs were defined as events that arose or worsened after the initiation of study drug. All AEs were standardized to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA) version 10.1 or higher preferred term and system organ class and subsequently summarized by treatment and age group. Abnormal laboratory values were summarized as either 1) AEs when deemed as such by the Investigator, 2) as population means over time, or 3) as markedly abnormal laboratory values. The ranges defining markedly abnormal are included with the discussion of each relevant laboratory parameter.</p><p>Vital signs were summarized descriptively by treatment group using both observed values and change from baseline values. Markedly abnormal vital signs (MAVS) were defined as measurements outside the following ranges. Systolic blood pressure was defined as either &#x0201c;high&#x0201d;, &#x02265;180 mmHg with a &#x02265;20 mmHg increase from baseline, or &#x0201c;low&#x0201d;, &#x02264;90 mmHg with a &#x02265;20 mmHg decrease relative to baseline. Markedly abnormal diastolic blood pressure was noted if it was &#x02265;105 mmHg with a &#x02265;20 mmHg increase from baseline. Markedly abnormal pulse rates were defined as either &#x0201c;high&#x0201d;, &#x02265;120 bpm (beats per minute) with a &#x02265;15 bpm increase from baseline, or &#x0201c;low&#x0201d;, &#x02264;50 bpm with a &#x02265;15 bpm decrease from baseline.</p><p>For all measures, baseline was defined as the last value obtained prior to the initiation of any study drug, and change from baseline is defined as the value at the named assessment time minus the baseline value. The generic term &#x0201c;study drug&#x0201d; refers to either IV ibuprofen, placebo, or active comparator, and patients treated for pain had access to rescue narcotics regardless of treatment allocation (eg, morphine). No transformations or imputations were applied to any safety data for the purposes of this analysis. All subjects who received at least one dose of any study drug are included, and all subjects were analyzed according to the actual drug received.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>An integrated safety database comprising data from the studies listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-8-753">Table 1</xref> was created. Each analysis dataset in the safety database was generated by combining the study data tabulation model tagged datasets from each individual study and adding required variables programmatically for standardization. Variables that were added include any that would be needed to generate combined analyses (eg, &#x0201c;treatment emergent&#x0201d; flags added to the AE dataset). The safety database contains the following datasets: subject level, AEs, exposure, laboratory results, and vital signs. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the populations and safety data from these ten studies. For the purposes of this analysis, descriptive statistics refers to the sample size (N), mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for any group variable. SAS software package version 9.2 was used and all analyses were subjected to formal verification procedures for accuracy and consistency. Due to differences in study design and data collection, not all analyses include all studies. Exceptions are noted with each figure or table.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec sec-type="intro|methods"><title>Study characteristics</title><p>All ten, company-sponsored, Phase II&#x02013;IV studies conducted with IV ibuprofen in adult patients were included in this analysis and comprise the clinical trial safety database for IV ibuprofen (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-jpr-8-753">Table 1</xref>). The studies were conducted between 2002 and 2014. There were eight controlled and two open-label designs. In the eight controlled studies, which were all randomized and double-blind, subjects received either IV ibuprofen (Caldolor<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>) or comparator &#x02013; IV ketorolac or placebo. Of the eight controlled studies, five evaluated the benefit of IV ibuprofen to treat pain (surgical), two to relieve fever, and one for the treatment of pain and fever. Doses of IV ibuprofen ranged from 100 to 400 mg for the indication of fever and up to 800 mg for pain. In the two open-label, surveillance trials, all subjects received IV ibuprofen. One of these studies investigated IV ibuprofen for pain (surgical) and one for pain (any etiology) or fever. Doses of IV ibuprofen were either 400 mg (fever) or 800 mg (pain) in these studies. Safety data in the form of serious AEs (SAEs) were available from all ten studies, whereas AE (nonserious) data were available from eight studies. Clinically significant laboratory parameters were collected in six studies. Safety sub-analyses were conducted based on the different administration conditions used in several of the studies. Four trials investigated a shortened infusion time for IV ibuprofen (ie, 5&#x02013;10 vs 30 minutes);<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> four studies allowed dosing prior to surgery.<xref rid="b17-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b20-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">22</xref></p></sec><sec><title>Patient population: demographics, exposure, and indications</title><p>For the purposes of this analysis, the safety population consisted of 1,752 adults who received at least one dose of any study drug. IV ibuprofen was administered to 1,220 (69.6%) patients, 452 (25.8%) received placebo, and 80 (4.6%) received IV ketorolac as an active control. Of the 1,220 subjects that received IV ibuprofen, 173 were treated for fever and 1,087 were treated for pain, with 40 of these patients being treated for both indications. Reasons for pain were both nonsurgical (N=100) and surgical (N=987) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-jpr-8-753">Figure 1</xref>). The etiologies of nonsurgical pain included, for example, abdominal, back, and burn and are summarized elsewhere.<xref rid="b19-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> Surgeries were predominantly gynecological or orthopedic in nature, and the most common procedure was hysterectomy (36.4%, <xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-jpr-8-753">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The mean age in years was similar between the treatment groups, 47 for patients receiving IV ibuprofen, 44 for placebo, and 46 in the active control group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-jpr-8-753">Table 3</xref>). While the majority of the study population were between the ages of 18 and 65 years (89%) and female (67%), there were 187 who were 65 years or older (defined as &#x0201c;elderly&#x0201d;). Of those patients &#x02265;65 years, 146 received IV ibuprofen, 34 received placebo, and 7 received IV ketorolac. Patient age was similarly distributed between all treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-jpr-8-753">Figure 2</xref>). The average weight was also similar between the treatment groups (range: 82.5&#x02013;88.5 kg).</p><p>On average, patients of either age stratum were treated with IV ibuprofen for 2 days with a maximum duration of 6 days (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jpr-8-753">Table 4</xref>). The mean dose of IV ibuprofen received over the course of treatment was 2,860 mg, and the maximum received was 16,000 mg. The distribution of the most common, average, cumulative amount of IV ibuprofen received was biphasic with the highest proportions of patients receiving either 400&#x02013;1,200 mg or 2,400&#x02013;4,800 mg (37% each) during their hospitalization. Adults aged 18&#x02013;64 years and elderly patients received similar amounts of IV ibuprofen for a similar duration.</p><p>Overall, 68% of patients received more than one dose of IV ibuprofen during their hospitalization, with five doses being the most common and 20 doses being the maximum (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t4-jpr-8-753">Table 4</xref>).

Subjects in all three studies who were randomized to receive IV ibuprofen continued IV ibuprofen therapy in the recovery period; similarly control subjects continued placebo.

Overall, subjects who received preoperative IV ibuprofen therapy experienced a similar frequency of AEs (91%) as those receiving intraoperative IV ibuprofen or placebo (86% and 89%, respectively). Patients did not experience an increase in hemorrhage when IV ibuprofen therapy was initiated prior to surgery (0%, vs 5.6% intraoperative, vs 6.7% placebo).

Mechanistically speaking, inhibiting the production of prostaglandins and thromboxane eliminates ligands which stimulate peripheral nociceptors to recognize pain and reduces the pro-inflammatory milieu at the wound, or incision, site. NSAIDs also exert antinociceptive effects in the central nervous system and these effects can be the result of central COX inhibition that reduces prostaglandin production in the spinal cord and brain as well as through COX-independent mechanisms (eg, G protein receptor inhibition).<xref rid="b25-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> Prostaglandin production by spinal COX enzymes has been shown to play a role in the initiation and maintenance of pain perception, and the resulting hyperalgesia can be both prevented and reversed by the administration of NSAIDs including ibuprofen.<xref rid="b27-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> The establishment of hyperalgesia is likely dependent on COX2 and the production of PGE<sub>2</sub>. Using arterial spin labelling imaging of the human brain, the work of Hodkinson et al confirms the analgesic effects of ibuprofen following surgery, demonstrates the activation by ibuprofen of regions in the brain associated with descending pain modulation, and suggests that ibuprofen only exerts central nervous system activity in the presence of inflammatory pain.<xref rid="b30-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Ibuprofen has also been shown to decrease pain perception in rats following spinal <italic>N</italic>-methyl-D-aspartate receptor activation involving nitric oxide.<xref rid="b31-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> Cumulatively, data from human and animal studies portray a complex mechanism for the analgesic effects elicited by NSAIDs, particularly ibuprofen, both centrally and peripherally.</p><p>The relative extent of COX1 or COX2 inhibition elicited by any given NSAID is also associated with adverse experiences common to the drug class. Broadly, these adverse experiences are GI, CV, hematological, and renal. As indicated by the reductions in nausea, vomiting, and constipation relative to placebo, GI complications were far less prevalent in the IV ibuprofen-treated population (37%) than in the placebo group (62%, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-jpr-8-753">Table 5</xref>). The GI events recorded in these clinical trials, but not summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="t5-jpr-8-753">Table 5</xref> (eg, diarrhea, abdominal discomfort, gastritis, etc), occurred at frequencies less than 1% in the IV ibuprofen group. It is unclear whether the reductions in GI complications in the IV ibuprofen group are due to the morphine sparing, analgesic, or anti-inflammatory properties of the drug, but clearly benefit patients regardless of mechanism. Cardiovascular AEs of any type were not highly represented in this analysis. Only 3% of IV ibuprofen-treated patients experienced some type of cardiac event, similar to placebo (2%). With the exception of tachycardia (IV ibuprofen 1%, placebo 2%), no single CV event occurred in as much as 1% of either treatment group. This favorable CV profile may be due to the balanced inhibition of COX1 and COX2 isoenzymes by ibuprofen. Similarly, the cumulative data from the studies included in this analysis demonstrate that there was no increase in anemia or hemorrhagic events and no decrease in hemoglobin, hematocrit, or platelet counts in patients treated with IV ibuprofen relative to those receiving placebo. Additionally, patients receiving IV ibuprofen before surgical incision had a similar rate of bleeding-related events as did those who initiated therapy intraoperatively and both of these were similar to placebo. Finally, the data from this analysis did not indicate an increase in renal impairment in IV ibuprofen-treated individuals as assessed by AE terms, SCr, or BUN levels. Indeed, the only AE that was represented more frequently in the IV ibuprofen-treated group was infusion site pain. Previous studies of IV analgesics demonstrate a rate of infusion site reactions ranging from 5% to 29%.<xref rid="b33-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b36-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> The rate of infusion site reactions in this cumulative analysis (5%) is consistent with other IV non-narcotic analgesics. Administering the drug into a large lumen vein (eg, antecubital vs hand) may decrease infusion site discomfort in subjects who are sensitive to infusions.</p><p>The most recent practice guidelines for acute pain management &#x02013; eg, surgical pain &#x02013; were released by the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) in 2012. In this guideline, the ASA notes that there are multiple undesirable outcomes resulting from the under-treatment of pain due to surgery. These include thromboembolism, pulmonary complications, extended hospital or intensive care unit length of stay, unplanned readmission for pain management, suffering, impaired quality of life, and the development of chronic pain syndromes.<xref rid="b37-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> Among the many recommendations made were the preoperative initiation of therapy (a single agent) in anticipation of postoperative pain and the employment, whenever possible, of multimodal techniques (two or more agents, preferably with different mechanisms of action). In the opinion of the ASA, one component of multimodal therapy should be a continual (around-the-clock) NSAID regimen, particularly in the postoperative period, unless otherwise contraindicated. Four studies in this analysis began IV ibuprofen therapy prior to surgical incision and the cumulative safety data indicates that the safety of preoperative dosing is comparable to that of intraoperative and postoperative dosing. This observation suggests that IV ibuprofen could routinely be initiated prior to surgery and continued through the recovery period. For extended surgeries (&#x02265;6 hours), the anesthesiologist can administer additional doses of IV ibuprofen intraoperatively maintaining prostaglandin inhibition and minimizing postoperative inflammation and pain. Furthermore, the dosage strength of IV ibuprofen can be tailored to the needs of the individual patient as both 400 and 800 mg dosing schedules are included in the product labelling with no limitation on duration. Because improvement in pain as measured by patient-reported VAS score has been demonstrated as a dose-dependent effect,<xref rid="b38-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> the ability to titrate any analgesic to maximize pain relief while minimizing undesirable effects is an important benefit of IV ibuprofen.</p><p>The ASA guidelines also address certain patient populations &#x02013; particularly elderly, the critically ill, or those who are otherwise cognitively impaired. Elderly patients were considered to be more susceptible to the adverse outcomes of under-treatment, and the under-treatment of elderly patients was deemed a widespread phenomenon. No recommendations were made regarding specific agents to be used in elderly populations. It is important to note that elderly patients who received IV ibuprofen also experienced far fewer AEs overall (59%) than did those receiving placebo (94%). In addition to less nausea, vomiting, and constipation, elderly individuals who received IV ibuprofen experienced proportionately less anemia, hypotension, pruritus, dyspepsia, deep vein thrombosis, dysuria, and anxiety than their placebo-treated counterparts. Alleviation of these symptoms is an important consideration in this vulnerable population known to be undertreated.<xref rid="b39-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Therapies that require self-administration (ie, patient controlled analgesia) were deemed unsuitable for critically ill, cognitively impaired, and communicatively impaired patients. These special groups may require additional therapies to ensure acceptable pain management. IV ibuprofen is well suited to satisfy many of the recommendations of the ASA including initiation of therapy prior to surgery, continual administration through recovery, elderly use, and controlled administration to critically ill and cognitively impaired patients. The potential benefits of multimodal analgesia include reducing the overall pharmaceutical load on a patient (especially narcotics) thereby increasing the safety of the total anesthesia protocol, decreasing recovery time and hospital stays, and of course, better pain management.<xref rid="b24-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Narcotics which bind to opioid receptors are prescribed for the treatment of both acute and chronic pain. The common side effects associated with opioid administration are well known and include constipation, nausea, vomiting, sedation, and dizziness. Constipation has been noted to occur with as little as one dose of morphine and may effect up to 95% of patients receiving opioid therapy. Constipation is a potentially serious complication which can result in decreased patient compliance and therefore inferior pain control, hemorrhoid formation, rectal pain, bowel rupture, and potentially death. Less common adverse effects include respiratory depression, reduced gastric motility, bladder dysfunction (eg, urinary retention), immunological depression (both adaptive and innate), hormonal dysfunction (opioid endocrinopathy), sleep disturbances, and CV complications (eg, vasodilation, hypotension, bradycardia). Over time, tolerance, hyperalgesia (increased pain sensitivity), and addiction or physical dependence can develop. It is generally recommended that opioids be used in conjunction with other analgesic approaches (pharmaceutical and otherwise) and for the shortest time possible.<xref rid="b40-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> Thus, limiting use of opioid analgesics by any means can increase overall patient safety in the hospital setting. Multiple meta-analyses clearly demonstrate that members of the NSAID drug class confer an opioid sparing effect which is a safety benefit when opioid-associated AEs and the potential for addiction are considered. The extent of the reduction in narcotic use by any given NSAID would be dependent on multiple factors including, but not limited to, the extent of preexisting central sensitization (duration of pain) and the pain level experienced by the patient &#x02013; even under sedation. Thus, when assessing the extent of morphine sparing reported by a clinical trial, the minimum baseline pain score (eg, VAS) required for eligibility must be taken into account. Due to the nature of the approved indications for IV ibuprofen, clinical studies enroll subjects with mild to moderate pain and above (ie, VAS &#x02265;30 mm, 100 mm scale). Alternatively, studies of IV diclofenac or ketorolac focus on moderate to severe pain and exclusively enroll subjects with a baseline VAS of &#x02265;50 mm. Thus, the extent of morphine sparing cannot be compared between the two clinical programs. Alternatively, the conclusion which can be made is that despite the inclusion of a portion of patients with lower baseline pain scores (who may never require narcotics), the use of IV ibuprofen prior to and during surgery is consistently associated with reductions in narcotic use across studies &#x02013; up to a 74% reduction when integrated into multimodal pain management regimens (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001).<xref rid="b21-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> This is a substantial reduction when considered as an absolute value and even more so when the potential dilution of the morphine-sparing effect by inclusion of patients with lower baseline pain is considered.</p><p>This analysis demonstrates that IV ibuprofen has a favorable safety profile in comparison to placebo with morphine rescue. In comparison to patients who received placebo, fewer IV ibuprofen-treated patients experience AEs overall (placebo, 85% vs IV ibuprofen 60%). A few of these improvements are consistent with the antipyretic and analgesic effects of NSAIDs, whereas others may indicate potential treatment benefits that go beyond pain and fever reduction, such as opioid sparing and alleviation of inflammatory processes during disease and wound healing.<xref rid="b4-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Indeed, easing the three most common AEs encountered in these trials &#x02013; nausea, vomiting, and constipation &#x02013; contributes substantially to patient satisfaction, recovery time, and minimizing the use of other pharmacological agents.<xref rid="b41-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>Preventing central sensitization is a primary goal of multimodal pain management and NSAIDs have been shown to function both peripherally and centrally in nociception. In the ascending pain cascade, NSAIDs would act at the peripheral nociceptors to eliminate pain-inducing ligands and pro-inflammatory mediators. Additionally, NSAIDs also act centrally both in the spinal dorsal horn, to inhibit PGE<sub>2</sub> production via COX2, and in the brain by activating medullary and cortical (eg, posterior cingulate cortex and orbitofrontal cortex) regions involved in the descending inhibitory pain cascade.<xref rid="b28-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b30-jpr-8-753" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> An agent such as IV ibuprofen would permit the anesthetist to maintain a constant level of prostaglandin inhibition over the course of a prolonged surgery and to continue that dosing regimen in the postoperative period. To maximize effective analgesia, a multimodal approach &#x02013; including an agent such as IV ibuprofen that is capable of inhibiting the perception of pain peripherally and centrally in combination with other synergistic analgesics &#x02013; is likely the best treatment option for many patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Overall, IV ibuprofen demonstrates a favorable safety profile resulting in fewer AEs relative to subjects who received placebo with morphine rescue, with the exception of infusion site reactions. In clinical trials, administration of IV ibuprofen has been accomplished in as little as 5&#x02013;7 minutes and has been administered prior to surgical incision with no increase in AEs relative to patients receiving doses over 30 minutes either intra- or postoperatively. Patients receiving IV ibuprofen require less morphine and experience less pain than do their placebo-treated counterparts with no measurable increases in surgical blood loss, perioperative CV, renal, or respiratory adverse effects. Our results echo those of previously published meta-analyses indicating a low RR for ibuprofen (1.8) vs diclofenac (3.3: 183% increased risk) or ketorolac (11.5: 639% increased risk). Thus, IV ibuprofen can be safely given prior to surgery and continued in the postoperative period as a component of multimodal pain management.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>Dr Stephen R Southworth is a consultant for Cumberland Pharmaceuticals Inc. and has served as an investigator and participant in the Speaker Bureau.
