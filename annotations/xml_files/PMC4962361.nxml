Introduction</title><p>Ulcerative colitis [UC] is an inflammatory disease of the large bowel characterised by relapsing and/or remitting gastrointestinal and systemic symptoms, which include bloody diarrhoea and rectal urgency.<sup><xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Primary goals of UC management are induction and maintenance of disease remission, including healing of the mucosa, to improve patients&#x02019; health and quality of life.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> With no known cure for UC, most patients will need lifelong maintenance medical therapy to help prevent disease relapse.<sup><xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> In a prospective trial by Meucci and colleagues,<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> patients with mild-to-moderate UC relapse received induction treatment with a combination of oral and topical mesalazine. If patients were in clinical <italic>and</italic> endoscopic remission [Mayo score &#x02264; 1], the observed 1-year incidence of relapse was 23% compared with a relapse rate of 80% in patients who attained only clinical, but not endoscopic, remission. Similarly, in patients with moderate-to-severe UC relapse who were treated with infliximab in the Active Ulcerative Colitis Trial [ACT]-1 and ACT-2,<sup><xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> colectomy risk was significantly lower if patients had a Mayo endoscopy subscore &#x02264; 1 than if the mucosa was more severely affected [Mayo score &#x02265; 2].</p><p content-type="indent">For patients with active mild-to-moderate UC, mesalazine [5-aminosalicylic acid; 5-ASA] has an established efficacy and a favourable safety profile; therefore, it has been recommended as first-line therapy.<sup><xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> Multimatrix mesalazine is a once-daily [QD], oral formulation of 5-ASA for induction and maintenance of remission in mild-to-moderate UC.<sup><xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> In two phase 3, placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised studies, multimatrix mesalazine was shown to be safe and effective in the induction of complete [clinical and endoscopic] remission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> A subsequent long-term maintenance study of multimatrix mesalazine treatment demonstrated high clinical and endoscopic remission rates in a subset of patients from the combined phase 3 induction studies who had achieved complete [clinical and endoscopic] remission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> A phase 4, open-label study also demonstrated efficacy of multimatrix mesalazine in maintaining quiescence in patients with UC,<sup><xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> and another phase 3 study showed that multimatrix mesalazine was not inferior to a twice-daily [BID], delayed-release formulation of mesalazine in endoscopic maintenance of remission.<sup><xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">Although multimatrix mesalazine has demonstrated efficacy in induction and maintenance of remission in UC, little is currently known about the effect of the success of induction treatment on long-term outcomes. In addition, dose reduction during UC maintenance is frequently employed as a therapeutic approach to reduce the number of pills patients have to take, or it can merely be a consequence of poor adherence. This strategy has not been formally studied in a prospective fashion. This study [MOMENTUM trial; ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01124149] was designed to determine whether patients who achieved complete remission with mucosal healing after induction therapy with multimatrix mesalamize had better long-term outcomes compared with those who attained only partial remission.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>2.1. Patients</title><p>Participants were aged &#x02265; 18 years and had an established diagnosis of UC by earlier sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy with compatible histology, or were newly diagnosed with UC. Disease activity was assessed using a modified UC&#x02013;Disease Activity Index [UC-DAI]. The UC-DAI consists of 4 parameters [each scored from 0&#x02013;3; maximum score = 12]: rectal bleeding, stool frequency, rectosigmoidoscopy, and Physician&#x02019;s Global Assessment [PGA]. The standard UC-DAI was modified so that an endoscopy score of 1 [mild disease] did not include friability, which was scored as 2 [moderate disease], as previously described.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Eligible patients had active disease [total modified UC-DAI of 4 to 10], with an endoscopy score &#x02265; 1 and PGA &#x02264; 2. Patients could receive stable maintenance therapy of 5-ASA &#x02264; 3.2g/day [excluding multimatrix mesalazine] or the equivalent dose of sulphasalazine. This treatment was discontinued at study start. Pregnant women were excluded. Additional exclusion criteria included: onset of flare on mesalazine &#x0003e; 6 weeks before the study [no time limit for flare onset if untreated], Crohn&#x02019;s disease, proctitis [inflammation extent &#x02264; 15cm from anus], bleeding disorders, active peptic ulcer disease, asthma and known hypersensitivity to mesalazine, previous colonic surgery, moderate/severe renal and/or hepatic impairment, and previous biologic [eg anti&#x02013;tumour necrosis factor] use. Stool cultures were performed during screening and, if positive for enteric pathogens, the patient was ineligible.</p><p content-type="indent">The study protocol, informed consent document, and all patient recruitment information were approved by the institutional review board or independent ethics committee at each site.

A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint was also conducted at final on-treatment assessment [FoTA], defined as data from Month 12 or an early withdrawal visit. A second sensitivity analysis of the maintenance data was conducted on the patient population, with biopsies that confirmed histologically active UC at baseline [maintenance phase positive baseline biopsy population].

Discussion</title><p>This prospective study is the first to examine the scheduled dose reduction of 5-ASA in UC patients. We explored maintenance outcomes in patients with UC treated with an induction regimen of multimatrix mesalazine 4.8g/day, then switched to maintenance phase at 2.4g/day. The primary endpoint was met, as a significantly higher proportion of patients in complete vs partial remission at the start of the maintenance phase were in complete remission 12 months later. These results were supported by sensitivity analyses on the primary endpoint, as well as results from the maintenance phase secondary endpoint analyses.</p><p content-type="indent">Our study indicates that the outcomes following mesalazine induction are predictive of long-term outcome. Half of the patients who achieved complete remission during induction with high-dose multimatrix mesalazine were able to maintain complete remission after 12 months of treatment with a reduced dosage, a success rate almost twice as high as in the patients entering maintenance in partial remission. Nonetheless, one in four patients attaining partial remission after induction reached complete remission 12 months later. In addition, &#x0003e; 40% of patients in the partial remission group had symptom scores of 0 at Month 12, and &#x0003e; 60% of patients in the partial remission group demonstrated mucosal healing at Month 12. It is possible that some of the observed difference between the groups is due to overlap of bowel irritability; this is a common challenge in symptom-based assessments of disease activity in UC. However, non&#x02013;symptom-based measures [eg, endoscopy] also resulted in significant group differences, suggesting that underlying inflammation was a primary factor in differentiation. These findings highlight the importance of long-term mesalazine treatment for patients with UC and suggest that, contrary to previous and non&#x02013;evidence-based assertions, 2.4g/day of multimatrix mesalazine during maintenance may be beneficial for both those in complete and those in partial remission, following induction at higher doses.</p><p content-type="indent">It is well appreciated that both patients and physicians dose reduce mesalazine while in maintenance phase. This study showed that complete remission was a significant predictor of successful dose reduction in the maintenance phase; patients attaining that endpoint may be most suitable for this strategy. Conversely, patients without complete remission, including mucosal healing, would probably benefit from an additional period of high-dose mesalazine treatment, additional topical treatment, or even escalation to other classes of therapies. These patients may also benefit from combination treatment with aminosalicylate enemas and potentially topical or even oral corticosteroids.</p><p content-type="indent">There are studies that have explored the benefit of higher-dose mesalazine for maintenance, and we believe that these studies add information regarding potential treatment considerations for patients with a more complex disease course, who have not achieved complete remission within 8 weeks or who relapse after dose reduction. The continued use of high-dose mesalazine is supported by a recent retrospective study that examined the efficacy of 4.0g/day maintenance therapy with mesalazine [PENTASA<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>] in Japanese UC patients who had achieved clinical improvement or remission<sup><xref rid="CIT0016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup>; in this study, fewer patients who received long-term [ &#x0003e; 105 days] vs short-term [&#x02264; 105 days] maintenance treatment relapsed [29.8% vs 48.3%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05], and the median time to relapse was also longer in the long-term treatment group. Another retrospective study comparing low- [2.4&#x02013;2.8g/day] vs high-dose [4.4&#x02013;4.8g/day] mesalazine maintenance treatment among UC patients found no significant differences in flare risk between groups when adherence to medication was high or moderate,<sup><xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> suggesting that adherence may be more important for reducing flare risk than the dose used for maintenance therapy. The importance of achieving mucosal healing for long-term outcomes is supported by the results of a study by Meucci and colleagues, who demonstrated that patients achieving clinical but not endoscopic remission following 6 weeks of oral [4g/day] and topical [2g/day] mesalazine treatment experienced significantly higher cumulative relapse rates after 1 year compared with those who achieved both clinical and endoscopic remission [80% vs 23%; <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001].<sup><xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>
</p><p content-type="indent">Another implication of our study findings for clinical practice is that endoscopic assessment appears to play a pivotal part in patient management, since it is an essential tool to evaluate the mucosa and guide the clinician to reach the treatment target of mucosal healing. Future mesalazine studies should explore dynamic and repeated interval dosing to allow for treatment adjustments based on long-term clinical and endoscopic stability. For example, it is unclear whether those in partial remission could benefit from a longer cycle of high-dose induction, or whether those on 2.4g/day maintenance treatment who flare could benefit from a short interval of increased mesalazine dosing post-relapse.</p><p content-type="indent">The safety results from both the induction and the maintenance phases indicated that multimatrix mesalazine was well tolerated. Types and frequencies of TEAEs were similar between complete and partial remission groups. The safety profile was consistent with previous multimatrix mesalazine clinical studies, and no new safety signals were identified. In previous phase 3 induction studies,<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> as well as the associated maintenance study,<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> the safety profile of multimatrix mesalazine was similar to that of the placebo arms in the induction studies.<sup><xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> In the previous induction studies [combined analysis], the proportion of patients experiencing TEAEs was 32.4% for those on multimatrix mesalazine 4.8g/day, with headache being the most commonly reported [3.4%].<sup><xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> By comparison, in the induction phase of the current study, 28.2% of patients on multimatrix mesalazine reported TEAEs, with headache again being the most commonly reported [2.1%]. In the earlier phase 3 maintenance study, 37.9% of patients experienced TEAEs, mostly of mild or moderate intensity. The most commonly reported TEAEs were worsening UC [10.7% and 7.7% in the 2.4g/day single- and divided-dose cohorts, respectively] and gastrointestinal disorders.<sup><xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> In the maintenance phase of the current study, 37.2% of those in complete remission at Month 0 reported TEAEs, with UC [7.7%] being the most commonly reported.</p><p content-type="indent">Some limitations of the study include that this was an open-label study without a placebo control, which may have introduced sampling bias into the results. Also, the subjective component of the UC-DAI score may have introduced variability between investigator assessments, and subsequent classification of patients who are in endoscopic remission. Additionally, it remains unclear how previous mesalazine dosing affected the long-term outcomes of these patients, as study patients could have received up to 3.2g/day mesalazine before study entry. Finally, we did not use independent assessment of endoscopic recordings, an approach that has recently become standard in modern UC trials but was not yet common practice at the start of this study. As the same endoscopist performed both procedures in the patient, this may have introduced unconscious bias related to improvements. However, the blinding and randomisation design may have ameliorated this limitation.</p><p content-type="indent">The data obtained from the current study confirm that long-term maintenance with multimatrix mesalazine is safe and efficacious in patients with mild-to-moderate UC. Those who begin maintenance treatment in complete remission have improved long-term outcomes compared with those who begin maintenance treatment in partial remission.</p></sec><sec><title>Funding</title><p>This work was supported by Shire Development LLC.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of Interest</title><p>DR has received financial support for research from AbbVie, Elan, Warner Chilcott, and Prometheus; received lecture fees from Merck; and consulted for AbbVie, Janssen, UCB, Elan, Shire, Exagen, Prometheus, and Takeda.
