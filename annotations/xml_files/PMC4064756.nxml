With the wide-scale introduction of prenatal screening programs, the issue of second trimester abortion has become increasingly relevant, in particular for women whose pregnancies are complicated by a serious fetal anomaly (<xref rid="CIT0002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>). Prostaglandins and their analogues are widely used for medical Terminationof pregnancy. Misoprostol is a PGE1analogue available in a tablet form that is stable at room temperature and inexpensive (<xref rid="CIT0003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Two common routes of misoprostol administration are sublingual and vaginal; but they have different pharmacokinetics and effectiveness. Sublingual misoprostol reaches its peak concentration in a short time due to rapid absorption and has higher bioavailability; the vaginal route causes more prolonged regular uterine contractions. The vaginal route has less adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea after administration (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>). Therefore in this paper we have compared the sublingual route to the vaginal route in the administration of misoprostol for second-trimester termination.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="S0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Our study is a double blinded randomized clinical trial that was performed in Alzahra hospital of Rasht (IRAN), from September 2012 to January 2013. The study was approved by the ethics committee of Guilan University of Medical Sciences. Informed consent was obtained from patients. Indications for second trimester termination were intra uterine fetal death, chromosomal abnormalities, fetal anomaly and legal abortion based on maternal reasons. Exclusion criteria were contraindications to prostaglandins use (bronchial asthma, cough, appearance of skin signs, glaucoma),women with previous uterine surgery and cesarean section, multiple pregnancies, parity &#x0003e; 3, vaginal bleeding and placenta previa. Totally 268 pregnant women (between 12 and 24 weeks) were admitted. Four cases from vaginal and four cases from sublingual group withdrew before the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Fig. 1</xref>). Neither the investigator nor the patients were blinded to the treatment group. Women were randomly assigned to group A and B(130 patients in each group). Group A was given 400 &#x000b5;g sublingual misoprostol and vaginal placebo and group B was given 400 &#x000b5;g vaginal misoprostol and sublingual placebo at 4 hours interval (maximum of five doses) in 24 hours. The desire outcome was fetus expulsion and if did not occur, the same regimen was repeated 24 hours after the start of the first dose of misoprostol. A structured form was used to record age, previous obstetrics history ( miscarriage, parity, gravidity), the time interval between misoprostol application and fetus expulsion, the number of tablets required, side effects such as fever, chills, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, needing to analgesics and patient&#x02018;s preference on the routes of application. Analysis was done using the SPSS 16.0 statistical package. This study was done with financial support of Vice chancellor of research Guilan University of Medical Sciences.</p><fig id="F0001" position="float"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow chart for the progress through the trial</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JFRH-8-041-g001"/></fig><sec id="S20003"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed by using SPSS version16, All outcomes were assessed using Chi-squared test and independent t-test and mann-whitney.

But in our study no significant differences were seen in the success rate of fetus expulsion in 24 and 48 hours in both groups. Finally, TANG ET AL&#x02018;s study suggest that both routs of application are effective in second-trimester termination but, regarding to the side effects and patients acceptability, sublingual misoprostol is a better option.</p><p>Results of Delavari&#x02018;s study, that compared vaginal and sublingual routs by giving 400 &#x000b5;g misoprostol every 6 hours,reported that there were similar effects in second-trimester termination. The median induction to abortion period was 16 hours that is longer than our study(&#x0003c;15 hours) which is maybe due to longer interval between drugs application (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>).</p><p>Similar toBartusevicus&#x02018;s study (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), our study demonstrated that induction to abortion period is significantly shorter in the sublingual group and this group needed lower dose of drug for abortion. It can be due to different pharmacokinetics profile of two routes. Because of absent intestinal-hepatic passage in vaginal application, it seems that drug activity and bioavailability is higher in vaginal route (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>),but one study that investigated pharmacokinetics of vaginal and sublingual misoprostol, demonstrated that maximum plasma concentration was higher in sublingual application (<xref rid="CIT0001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>). Sublingual misoprostol can achievesthe higher peak concentration and bioavailability very quickly. Sustained and long-lasting effect is seen in vaginal absorption (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>), but the absorption is disturbed by local factors such as vaginal bleeding (<xref rid="CIT0007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>).</p><p>Some previous studies suggested that side effects such as fever, chills, diarrhea and vomiting are more common whit the sublingual route of administration(<xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>),but our study was not supported these findings. In our study, similar to Von Hertzen H&#x02018;s study (<xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>), the side effects were comparable in the two groups.</p><p>It seems that sublingual administration is a more preferable way of giving misoprostol (<xref rid="CIT0013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="CIT0015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). In our study,all patients experienced both vaginal and sublingual routes(misoprostol and placebo) and higher percentage of women preferred the sublingual route (74.6% versus 25.4%). The sublingual route appears to be more convenient and less uncomfortable.</p><p>This study concludes although both vaginal and sublingual routes have similar effectiveness and side effects in second-trimester termination, but sublingual route is a better option because of its quicker response and better acceptability.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This investigation was based on a thesis submitted by the third author to the Guilan University of Medical Sciences.
