Offering cervico-vaginal self-sampling for human papillomavirus testing (HPV self-sampling) to non-participants can increase screening participation. However, the effect varies substantially among studies, especially depending on the approach used to offer HPV self-sampling. The present trial evaluates the effect on participation in an organized screening program of a HPV self-sampling kit mailed directly to the home of the woman or mailed to the woman&#x02019;s home on demand only, compared with the standard second reminder for regular screening.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The CHOiCE trial is a parallel, randomized, controlled, open-label trial. It will include 9327 women aged 30&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years who are living in the Central Denmark Region and who have not participated in cervical cancer screening after an invitation and one reminder. The women will be equally randomized into three arms: 1) Directly mailed a second reminder including a HPV self-sampling kit; 2) Mailed a second reminder offering a HPV self-sampling kit, to be ordered by e-mail, text message, phone, or through a webpage; and 3) Mailed a second reminder for a practitioner-collected sample (control group). The primary outcome will be the proportion of women in the intervention groups who participate by returning their HPV self-sampling kit or have a practitioner-collected sample compared with the proportion of women who have a practitioner-collected sample in the control group at 90 and 180&#x000a0;days after mail out of the second reminders. Per-protocol and intention-to-treat analyses will be performed. The secondary outcome will be the proportion of women with a positive HPV self-collected sample who attend follow-up testing at 30, 60, or 90&#x000a0;days after mail out of the results.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The CHOiCE trial will provide strong and important evidence allowing us to determine if and how HPV self-sampling can be used to increase participation in cervical cancer screening. This trial therefore has the potential to improve prevention and reduce the number of deaths caused by cervical cancer.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Current Controlled Trials <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02680262?term=HPV+self+sampling&#x00026;rank=1">NCT02680262</ext-link>.

Yet, the effectiveness of such programs is challenged by suboptimal participation and coverage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], and more than half of all invasive cervical cancers are diagnosed among women who are under- or unscreened [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is therefore crucial to identify ways to improve screening participation, e.g. by removing existing barriers to regular screening.</p><p>In the Danish organized screening program, the overall participation rate, defined as having a screening test within 365&#x000a0;days after an invitation, is currently 65&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. This percentage has been decreasing slightly in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Earlier studies show sociodemographic inequalities in screening participation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Thus, a Danish study identify several barriers to participation, including lack of knowledge about screening and cervical cancer, discomfort during pelvic examinations, fear of cancer, practicalities in private life, and in access to testing facilities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Some of these barriers may be overcome if self-sampling at home is an option which, however, is not currently the case in the Danish screening program.</p><p>Recent research advocates the use of high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) testing over cytology because it is more sensitive in detecting cervical intraepithelial neoplasia of grade 2 or worse (CIN2+) and provides better protection against cervical cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Furthermore, hrHPV testing enables women to self-sample cervico-vaginal material; self-collected samples have shown sensitivity for detection of CIN2+ that is comparable to that of clinician-collected samples if validated Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-tests are used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Self-sampling also appears to improve screening participation. Hence, a meta-analysis showed that mailing women a test-kit for self-sampling at home, including pre-stamped envelopes for mailing of the sample to a laboratory for HPV testing, increased screening participation compared with women receiving standard invitation for regular screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The participation rate for women offered self-sampling varies widely among trials, ranging from 10&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] to 39&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] with a pooled 12.6&#x000a0;% absolute increase in participation compared with standard invitation when self-sampling kits were mailed directly to all women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Three other trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] used an opt-in approach for offering self-sampling, i.e. women were mailed an invitation to order a kit by phone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], or by mail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>], or to pick it up at a pharmacy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. One of these trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] showed a 12.3&#x000a0;% increase in participation among long-term non-participants, but the two other trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>] showed no positive effect on participation. Moreover, in the pooled analysis, these trials showed only an insignificant 0.2&#x000a0;% participation increase compared with women receiving standard invitations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Thus, more studies are needed to explore the effect and acceptability associated with other more timely and modern opt-in approaches for offering self-sampling (websites, e-mails, and text messages). To our knowledge, no previous studies have evaluated the effect on participation of offering self-sampling, either directly mailed or using timely opt-in procedures as compared with a standard second reminder.</p><p>Therefore, in the efforts to reduce barriers to cervical cancer screening and to increase participation, we will conduct a randomized, controlled effectiveness trial to evaluate the effect of two different approaches for offering HPV self-sampling to women who did not participate in the cervical cancer screening program despite an invitation and one reminder.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial design</title><p>CHOiCE (Cervical HOme-based CancEr screening) is a parallel, randomized, controlled, open-label trial nested into a population-based, organized cervical cancer screening program conducted in the Central Denmark Region.

</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Study setting</title><p>Denmark has a total of 5.6 million inhabitants, with 1.5 million women in the target population for cervical cancer screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Organized cervical cancer screening was introduced in the 1960s in some Danish counties and non-systematically implemented in the rest of the country until nationwide coverage was achieved in the late 1990s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. The policy and organization of cervical cancer screening are defined nationally, but the responsibility for running the screening program lies with the regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Denmark is divided into five regions one of which is the Central Denmark Region (23&#x000a0;% of the Danish population) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Since 2007, women aged 23&#x02013;49 years have been invited for cervical cancer screening every third year, while women aged 50&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years are invited every fifth year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Shortly before 3 or 5&#x000a0;years have passed since a woman&#x02019;s last registered cervical cytology result, she is sent an invitation advising her to book an appointment with a GP for a pelvic examination at which a liquid-based cytology specimen is collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. If the responsible Department of Pathology does not receive a cervical cytology specimen for analysis, up to two reminders will be sent 3 and 6&#x000a0;months after the initial invitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Women who do not respond to invitations or reminders will receive a new invitation in the next screening round, unless she has declined participation. For women aged 23&#x02013;59&#x000a0;years, the primary screening test is liquid-based cytology; while an hrHPV-DNA check-out test is recommended for women aged 60&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In the Danish Cervical Cancer Screening Program, all testing is free of charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>Routinely, all cervical cytology results, HPV test results, and histological diagnoses from cervical biopsies as well all other pathology specimens are registered in the national Danish Pathology Data Bank (DPDB) under the woman&#x02019;s unique Civil Personal Registration (CPR) number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The DPDB also keeps track of which women are due to receive invitations and reminders to participate in screening.</p><p>In the Central Denmark Region, all samples in the Cervical Cancer Screening Program are analyzed by the Department of Pathology, Randers Regional Hospital. Invitations and reminders are routinely handled by the Department of Public Health Programs, Randers Regional Hospital.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Participation and randomization</title><p>Participants are restricted to women aged 30 to 64&#x000a0;years living in the Central Denmark Region who have not participated in cervical cancer screening after an invitation and one reminder.

The eligible women&#x02019;s unique 10-digit CPR number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], including birthdate will be extracted as this allows us to follow, e.g. the women in Danish health registers. A CPR number is assigned to every Danish citizen upon birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Data will be extracted in Excel format and transferred to the REDCap system for storage and automated randomization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Participants will be assigned randomly to the three arms of the trial in a 1:1:1 ratio as per a computer-generated randomization schedule following simple randomization procedures.

The nature of the intervention and allocation ratio precludes the masking of the participants and study staff.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Interventions</title><p>Women in intervention group 1 will be mailed a modified second reminder, a leaflet entitled <italic>Facts</italic>, <italic>benefits, and drawbacks about HPV self-sampling</italic> and a self-sampling kit. The leaflet provides information about HPV and cervical cancer including benefits and drawbacks of HPV self-sampling compared with regular screening. The kit includes a brush device (Evelyn Brush, Rovers Medical Devices B.V, Oss, Netherlands), which should be used to collect a cervico-vaginal sample for subsequent hrHPV testing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>], written and drawn instructions on how to obtain and mail the sample, and a pre-stamped return envelope addressed to the Department of Pathology, Randers Regional Hospital, where the hrHPV testing will be performed. The instructions show how the woman should label the brush device with an attached laboratory specimen barcode. The woman is urged to mail the return envelope on the day the sample is taken. Women in intervention group 2 receive the same material as those in intervention group 1, except for the kit, which will be mailed to the women only on demand. Additionally, the leaflet for this group contains information on how to order the kit (by e-mail, text message, phone, or through a study webpage (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.hjemme-us.rm.dk">www.hjemme-us.rm.dk</ext-link>).

The test identifies HPV16, HPV18 and 12 other hrHPV types (31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66 and 68) in a single pool. Results are either 1) hrHPV-negative, 2) hrHPV-positive (HPV16, HPV18 and/or other hrHPV types), or 3) unsatisfactory. An unsatisfactory result includes specimens with a negative &#x003b2;-globin result, a sample damaged in transit, incorrect labelling, or insufficient material for analysis. The hrHPV test results of the self-collected samples will be registered in the DPDB.</p><p>Cervical cytology specimens obtained by GPs will be analyzed using the standard procedure used in the Central Denmark Region, i.e. microscopy as the primary procedure for control group women aged 23&#x02013;59&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. In case of detection of Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance (ASC-US) among women aged&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;30&#x000a0;years, an HPV DNA analysis will be performed using Cobas 4800 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. For women aged 60&#x02013;64&#x000a0;years, the primary analysis of the cervical cytology is Cobas 4800 HPV DNA analysis, and microscopy will be used as triage in case of hrHPV-positive test results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. When cervical cytology is made as follow-up on hrHPV-positive test results following self-sampling (see below), the specimens will be analyzed by microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Follow up after self-sampling</title><p>Women tested by use of self-sampling receive a written test result by ordinary mail.

Nearly half (45&#x000a0;%) of all newly diagnosed cervical cancers in Denmark are found among under-screened women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. Numerous other countries are facing a similar situation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Strategies to improve participation are important priorities for the Cervical Cancer Screening Program, and new strategies are needed to target women who have not participated in cervical cancer screening despite invitations for regular screening [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. HPV self-sampling is a valid screening tool that has the potential to overcome known barriers to regular screening as evidenced by trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] showing that self-sampling can improve screening participation, although the effect varied substantially between countries. In addition, high compliance to follow-up recommendations among self-sample hrHPV-positive women is necessary to achieve the wanted benefit of the intervention and a meta-analysis by Verdoodt et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] found that appropriate follow-up was achieved only in 82&#x000a0;% of women with a hrHPV-positive test result. Evidence from Denmark is therefore necessary to inform policy makers before introducing self-sampling.</p><p>The planned study gains validity from the fact that all Danish women have a unique CPR number and that all activities in the Danish healthcare system, including those related to cervical cancer screening, are registered using this number. This enables linkage to e.g. information on previous screening history which allows us to determine the capacity of self-sampling to recruit under- or unscreened women. The DPDB is a nationwide database that holds detailed, highly valid records on all pathology specimens, including cervical cytologies and HPV tests of provider-collected and self-collected samples from all Danish pathology departments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Another strength of the study is that the self-sampling procedure is embedded directly into a population-based, well-run organized screening program. Women accept to have their sample analyzed only by submitting it to the pathology department. Thus, the routines of this study can be transferred directly to daily routines with results that are expected to be similar to those of the present study. As the Central Denmark Region comprises a mix of urban and rural areas, we will also be able to disclose whether there are true urban-rural differences in the effect of self-sampling as suggested in an Italian trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. This may, in turn, afford us with better opportunities for transferring the results to other regions. Furthermore, we include a wider variety of more timely opt-in approaches than earlier studies using opt-in approaches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This may increase the effect of this procedure as compared with direct mailing of a test-kit. Overall, we therefore expect to be able to introduce an approach that is more cost-effective than earlier described approaches.</p><p>It is a limitation in our study that we use only one type of sample device, as differences in participation rates may hinge on the sample device chosen. However, two trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>] have compared the effects of a lavage and a brush self-sampling device on screening participation. These trials found a slightly higher participation with the brush device; i.e. the same brush device as used in our study. Another limitation is that the intervention is designed to target only hard-to-reach women by seeking to overcome barriers related to seeking a physician for a cervical cytology specimen. Other previously described barriers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] are not targeted in this study; but such barriers will clearly need to be investigated in future research.</p><p>The obtained results will be compared with the results of other self-sampling trials. Of particular interest is to study trials performed in countries with organized screening programs. We will seek to explain any discrepancies in the results with reference to differences in the study designs, interventions, study populations, and settings.</p><p>As the trial is an effectiveness study nested into a routine screening program, the findings will provide strong and important evidence allowing us to determine if and how HPV self-sampling can be used to improve screening participation. The trial therefore has the potential to improve cervical cancer prevention and to reduce the number of deaths caused by cervical cancer.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>Not applicable.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>This study was funded by the Health Research Fund of the Central Denmark Region, the Health Foundation, the LSB Foundation, the Family Hede Nielsen&#x02019;s Foundation, the Krista and Viggo Petersen&#x02019;s Foundation, and the Aragon Foundation.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Not applicable.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>MT is the principal investigator of the study and is responsible for conducting the study overall.
