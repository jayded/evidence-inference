Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry was performed for protein profiling of these samples.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Chronic LBP (CLBP) is the most frequent cause of activity limitation in adults under the age of 45
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Common causes of LBP include disc degeneration, lumbar disc herniation (LDH), lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar instability syndrome, and waist soft tissue lesions
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Clinically, only a small proportion (~20%) of LBP cases can be attributed with reasonable certainty to a pathologic or anatomical entity, because most of the signs and symptoms are not specific and are difficult to distinguish among diseases that exhibit LBP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In addition, there exist a significant number of cases of CLBP of unknown origin. Therefore, an accurate diagnosis of the cause of LBP represents a great challenge to orthopedists.</p><p>Disc degeneration can cause persistent pain and is believed to be a major cause of CLBP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Clinical disease resulting from this pathological process is known as discogenic low back pain (DLBP). DLBP and LDH are the two most common causes of CLBP, accounting for ~40% and ~30% of all cases of CLBP, respectively
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In contrast to LDH, DLBP is not accompanied by radicular symptoms or radiological evidence of excessive activity of nerves or segments
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Given that DLBP is clinically featured with many subjective symptoms, numerous risk factors, but has few objective positive markers and unclear pathogenesis, its diagnosis is often elusive
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Discography is currently the main diagnostic modality for DLBP; however, its reliability is controversial because discographic results rely heavily on the reproduction of the patient&#x02019;s pain and the operator&#x02019;s judgment and is therefore largely influenced by subjective factors. In addition, discography can cause many complications due to its invasive nature
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Thus, there is an intense debate over discography as a diagnostic tool to distinguish DLBP from other forms of CLBP and a more accurate, reliable and non-invasive diagnostic method is required.</p><p>DLBP is caused by a variety of pathologic processes, including degeneration, endplate damage and inflammation, which stimulate the intradiscal nociceptors while the disc periphery remains intact
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Normally there is a high density of blood vessels and nerves in the outer 1/3 of the annulus fibrosus, but not inside the disc. Degenerated intervertebral disc induces crack formation in the endplate and the outer 1/3 of the annulus fibrosus due to biomechanical reasons. As disc degeneration progresses, nascent vascular nerve endings grow inward along the fissure to form inflammatory granulation tissue that leads to the distribution of vessels and nerves inside the disc, even within the nucleus pulposus
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. During this process, biochemical, metabolic, inflammatory and immuno-reactive products from damaged cells can enter the bloodstream and alter the blood protein spectrum
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Since certain serum proteins can serve as diagnostic markers for the disease that causes their release from cells
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], serum proteomic profiling of DLBP will provide a means to identify diagnostic biomarkers for this clinical entity. Identification of objective biomarkers in serum that can aid in differential diagnosis would be of great clinical benefit.</p><p>Most serum proteins, including disease biomarkers, are often present in small amounts and are difficult to detect using conventional methods
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. Capture of low-abundance proteins is critical for facilitating marker discovery. Bead-based fractionation can greatly enrich low-abundance proteins and selectively separate certain peptides according to different chemical chromatographic surfaces on the outer layer of magnetic beads. The combination of bead-based fractionation with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) has been widely used for disease detection and biomarker identification using human body fluids (e.g., blood and urine), and carries advantages such as minimal invasiveness, high efficiency, low cost, and easy manipulation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The more sophisticated techniques, such as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) and linear trap quadrupole orbitrap MS, allow the direct identification of peptide sequences. Currently, there have been no reports of the use of these techniques for disease detection and biomarker identification in patients with DLBP.</p><p>In the current study, we conducted a MALDI-TOF-MS analysis of serum samples from patients with DLBP, chronic LDH, or CLBP of unknown origin, and normal controls, with an aim to establish diagnostic models for classification of these different entities and identify serum biomarkers for differentiation of DLBP from other forms of LBP.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Patients and serum sample collection</title><p>This study included three groups of patients: those with DLBP (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60), CLBP of unknown origin (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60), or chronic LDH (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;60).

Peptides were isolated from the serum using a magnetic beads-based weak cation exchange (MB-WCX) kit (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Magnetic beads with C8-functionality were divided into 5-&#x003bc;L aliquots in a 96-well microtiter plate, which was placed on the magnetic beads separation device (MPC-auto96, Dynal, Oslo, Norway) with the magnet down. Ten microliters of MB-WCX binding solution and 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of serum sample were added to the beads and carefully mixed using the mixing feature of the robot. The sample was incubated for 30&#x000a0;seconds and the magnet was lifted, followed by a 30-second waiting interval to settle the magnetic beads. The supernatant was removed and the magnet was lowered again. The magnetic beads were washed three times with MB-WCX washing solution provided with the kit, lifting and lowering the magnet as required. The peptides were eluted from the beads with 10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of 50% acetonitrile (ACN) and 2&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the elute was transferred to a fresh 348-well microtiter plate (Greiner, Frickenhausen, Germany). The remaining elute (6&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L) was transferred to an auto sample vial containing 54&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of water and stored for later use. Fifteen microliters of a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (0.3&#x000a0;g/L in ethanol:acetone 2:1) was added to the 1-&#x003bc;L elute in the 348-well microtiter plate and mixed carefully. One microliter of this mixture was spotted in quadruplicate on a MALDI AnchorChipTM (Bruker Daltonics).</p></sec><sec><title>MALDI-TOF MS</title><p>MALDI-TOF-MS measurements were performed using an Ultraflex TOF/TOF instrument (Bruker Daltonics) equipped with a SCOUT ion source, operating in linear mode. Ions formed with a N2 pulse laser beam (337&#x000a0;nm) were accelerated to 25&#x000a0;kV. For MALDI-TOF-MS analysis, 1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of the above diluted purified serum peptide was mixed with 0.5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of matrix solution and allowed to dry onto the MALDI sample plate (600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;M AnchorChip&#x02122;, Bruker Daltonics) according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions. Two peptides were also included in the matrix solution for internal calibration: 10 pmol/mL angiotensin II and 10 pmol/mL ACTH18-39 (Bruker Daltonics). Laser desorption was targeted randomly on the sample plate and samples were measured using an Autoflex III MALDI-TOF mass spectrometer (Bruker Daltonics), operating in positive ion linear (reflection) mode. Ionization was achieved by irradiation with a 50&#x000a0;Hz nitrogen laser. Spectra were the mean of 100 ionizations with fixed laser power in linear geometry mode and mass maps were obtained in reflectron mode. The spectra were calibrated externally with a mixture of protein/peptide standards in the range of 1,000 to 12,000&#x000a0;Da (Bruker Daltonics). The criteria for peak detection were: signal/noise ratio &#x0003e;5.2&#x000a0;Da peak width filter, and maximum peak number of 200. For data bank analysis, all spectra were processed by automatic baseline subtraction, peak detection, recalibration, and peak area calculation according to the predefined parameter settings. The intensities of the peaks of interest were normalized against the peak intensity of the ACTH internal standard. These mass shifts were corrected by the FlexAnalysis&#x02122; software after alignment with the two internal standards.</p></sec><sec><title>Identification of differential peptides</title><p>Peptide extracts were dried and re-suspended in 15&#x02013;20&#x000a0;mL of 5% formic acid for further MS/MS analysis using a LTQ mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, USA). Typically, 5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L of peptide extracts were actually injected for analysis. For LTQ mass spectrometer analysis, the peptide extracts were loaded at 15&#x000a0;mL/min for 6&#x000a0;minutes on a nanoAcquity&#x02122; column, followed by eluting and separating on a nanoAcquity&#x02122; UPLC&#x02122; column, using 90&#x000a0;minute gradients with 95% water, 5% ACN, 0.1% formic acid (solvent A); and 95% ACN, 5% water, 0.1% formic acid (solvent B) at a flow rate of 300&#x000a0;nL/min. The samples were run in data-dependent mode, where each full MS scanning was followed by three consecutive MS/MS scans of the three most abundant peptide molecular ions (typically doubly and triply charged ions), which were selected consecutively for collision-induced dissociation. The MS survey scans (300&#x02013;2,000&#x000a0;Da) were carried out and the acquisition cycle consisted of a survey scan at the highest resolving power (100,000). Dynamic exclusion was used with a series of parameters and the acquired MS/MS data were processed using BioworksBrowser 3.3.1.

Taking these into account, three differential peptides (1692.71&#x000a0;m/z, 1886.86&#x000a0;m/z and 1779.28&#x000a0;m/z) were selected for peptide identification. By comparing areas of the selected peptide peaks, we found that the peptides to which 1779&#x000a0;m/z and 1692.71&#x000a0;m/z corresponded showed similar expression patterns (Figure&#x000a0;
<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>), with the lowest expression level in DLBP, followed by CLBP, N and LDH. Their expression levels differed significantly different between DLBP and the other three groups (<italic>Ps</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 for all), but not between CLBP of unknown origin, LDH and N.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. There is currently an urgent need to discover biomarkers for diagnosis of DLBP and classify it from other forms of CLBP. In the present study, we used the MALDI-TOF-MS technology to perform protein profiling of serum samples from patients with DLBP, chronic LDH, or CLBP of unknown origin, and healthy controls. By paired comparison analysis of protein peaks between the four groups of subjects, we identified a series of peaks showing significant differential expression between different groups. We then compared the discriminative ability of representative differential peptide peaks to classify different groups of subjects and constructed diagnostic models using peptide peaks showing different peak area to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy. We found that the accuracy of classification of DLBP <italic>vs.</italic> CLBP was not very high in the blind test (forecasting ability, 67.24%; sensitivity, 70%), although a higher accuracy was observed for classification of DLBP <italic>vs</italic>. LDH and LDH <italic>vs</italic>. N (forecasting abilities, ~90%; sensitivities, &#x0003e;90%). Finally, we pursued a further investigation of three representative differential peaks and identified the peaks at 1779&#x000a0;m/z and 1692&#x000a0;m/z as peptides of complement C3, and the peak at 1886&#x000a0;m/z as a human fibrinogen peptide. These results benefit not only the diagnosis of CLBP but also the understanding of the differences of different forms of CLBP. The ability to distinguish between different causes of LBP and the identification of serum biomarkers may be of great value in diagnosing different causes of DLBP and predict treatment efficacy.</p><p>The primary purpose of this study was to distinguish DLBP from CLBP of other causes and identify serum markers for DLBP. However, the fewest statistically differential peptide peaks were detected between DLBP and CLBP of unknown origin, and the diagnostic model developed based on differential peptides had the lowest accuracy in the blind test (sensitivity, 70%), although more statistically differential peptide peaks were detected and more accurate diagnostic models developed in other pairwise comparison analyses. In patients with CLBP (including those with DLBP), pain can be caused by multiple factors, including both discogenic factors and factors outside the spinal canal
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Since current diagnosis of DLBP relies on discography, its low sensitivity might have resulted in the misdiagnosis of some cases of DLBP as CLBP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This may be the main reason for poor performance of models for classification of DLBP vs. CLBP in this study.</p><p>In our study, two differential peaks (1779&#x000a0;m/z and 1692&#x000a0;m/z) were identified as peptides of complement C3. Complement C3 is a central molecule in the complement system and plays a very important role in inflammatory and immune responses
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Interestingly, the complement system has been implicated in cartilage degradation, and C3 has been found to be aberrantly increased in synovial fluids from individuals with osteoarthritis
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. However, serum levels of complement C3 were decreased in our patients with DLBP. The clinical implications of this finding remain unclear. Given that complement C3 levels are significantly decreased in patients with different types of autoimmune diseases
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>], and that inflammation secondary to an autoimmune response to the nucleus pulposus has been implicated as a primary pain source in DLBP
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>], we speculate that dysregulation of the complement system has a key role in the pathogenesis of DLBP.</p><p>Fibrinogen is a 340&#x000a0;kDa glycoprotein composed of three polypeptide chains. It is a major player in the mediation of inflammatory responses and inhibition of nerve fiber growth and tissue repair processes
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Our finding that serum levels of fibrinogen were significantly increased in patients with DLBP indicates a close relationship between fibrinogen and DLBP. Since the development of DLBP involves inflammation, nerve growth and tissue repair, it appears reasonable to surmise that elevated expression of fibrinogen may be involved in the pathogenesis of DLBP. Future studies are required to address the precise role of fibrinogen in the pathogenesis of DLBP.</p><p>Both DLBP and LDH are degenerative disc diseases. In our study, paired comparison analysis led to the identification of 23 significantly differential peaks between DLBP and LDH. The diagnostic models developed based on these differential peaks showed a good classification performance between the two groups. These findings suggest that DLBP and LDH appear not to share a similar pathogenesis. Consistent with this, some DLBP patients suffered pain for more than 300&#x000a0;months but did not develop LDH until the recent attack.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the ClinProt system is effective in screening differential serum peptides between different forms of CLBP and searching for markers to develop diagnostic models for these diseases. The identification of complement C3 and fibrinogen as two potential serum biomarkers for DLBP will shed light on the further understanding of the pathogenesis of DLBP. In addition, the presence of a significant number of differential peaks between DLBP and LBP suggests they appear not to share a similar pathogenesis. However, there is still a gap between our findings and their application in clinical practice. Future multi-center, controlled studies with larger sample sizes are required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the two identified serum biomarkers in the diagnosis of DLBP.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ACN: Acetonitrile; CLBP: Chronic low back pain; GA: Genetic algorithm; LBP: Low back pain; LDH: Lumbar disc herniation; MALDI-TOF-MS: Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry; MB-WCX: Magnetic beads-based weak cation exchange; MS/MS: Tandem mass spectrometry; N: Normal controls; ODI: Oswestry disability index; QC: Fast classification algorithm; SD: Standard deviation; S/N: Signal/noise; SNN: Neural network algorithm; VAS: Visual analogue scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>All authors declared there were no conflict interests involved.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>YGZ made substantial contributions to the conception and design, acquisition of data, analysis and interpretation of data, and drafting of the manuscript; TMG carried out the WCX magnetic bead analysis and MALDI-TOF MS.
