Peficitinib 50, 100 and 150&#x02005;mg each showed statistically significantly higher ACR20 response rates compared with placebo, and response rates increased up to 150&#x02005;mg with a statistically significant dose response. The total incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar between the placebo (64.3%) and peficitinib 25, 50, 100 and 150&#x02005;mg groups (70.9%, 64.9%, 52.7% and 67.2%, respectively). TEAEs occurring more frequently in the peficitinib group compared with the placebo group included nasopharyngitis, increased blood creatine phosphokinase and diarrhoea.

The study objective was to evaluate the efficacy, safety and dose response of a novel oral JAK inhibitor, peficitinib monotherapy. After a 4-week screening period, patients were equally assigned to a placebo or peficitinib 25, 50, 100, 150&#x02005;mg group, and the study drug was orally administered once daily after breakfast for 12&#x02005;weeks. After the 12-week treatment period, efficacy and safety assessments were performed, and a follow-up was also conducted 4&#x02005;weeks after the end of treatment to confirm the incidence of AEs.

We designed this study to treat the patients with a peficitinib monotherapy, which usually demonstrates clear efficacy dose responses compared with DMARD background therapy. Once-daily oral administration of peficitinib for 12&#x02005;weeks reduced RA symptoms statistically, according to the measured efficacy variables in this study, including the ACR response and DAS28-CRP score. A statistically significant dose response was observed in the primary efficacy variable of the ACR20 response rate at week 12 (or at early termination), and the differences from the placebo group were 12.9%, 20.9%, 43.8% and 54.8% in the peficitinib 25, 50, 100 and 150&#x02005;mg groups, respectively.</p><p>Results of the secondary efficacy variables, such as ACR50/70 response rates and DAS28-CRP supported the results for the primary efficacy variable to some extent. In general, the peficitinib 100 and 150&#x02005;mg groups showed a statistically significant improvement in the secondary efficacy variables compared with the placebo group. Peficitinib was also suggested to improve RA patients&#x02019; activities of daily life in HAQ-DI. Serum matrix metalloproteinase-3, known as a predictor of joint destruction in RA,<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> showed clear dose-dependent change up to the 150 mg group (see online <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ard.bmj.com/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1136/annrheumdis-2015-208279/-/DC1">supplementary figure</ext-link> S2).</p><p>Sensitivity analysis using the non-responder imputation method was also performed for the efficacy variables of ACR20, 50 and 70 response rates, and the results were similar to the primary results of ACR response rates using LOCF method (data are not shown). ACR response rates in the peficitinib 100 and 150&#x02005;mg groups were comparable with past clinical trials of anti-TNF monotherapies conducted in Japan. On the other hand, efficacy of peficitinib in combination with MTX has not been demonstrated in Japan. The efficacies of peficitinib are now confirmed in more detail by ongoing phase III studies designed with a combination with DMARDs including MTX, larger number of study patients and longer treatment period (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02308163 and NCT02305849).</p><p>Peficitinib showed acceptable safety profile in short-term treatment of 12&#x02005;weeks. No apparent dose dependency was observed in the incidence of &#x02265;grade 3 TEAEs or serious TEAEs across the placebo and peficitinib groups. The most frequently reported AEs were nasopharyngitis, aggravation of RA due to lack of efficacy, gastrointestinal events and CPK elevation, but no serious infection was observed in this study. However, it is very important to carefully evaluate the safety of peficitinib in future studies, especially adverse effects related to the suppression of immune functions such as infections, because it has been demonstrated that the JAK inhibitor tofacitinib reduced the T cell stimulatory capacity of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> and inhibited human B cell activation in in vitro study.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Herpes zoster occurred in total four patients (6.3/100 patient-year) in peficitinib groups with no dose dependency, and the incidence rate is comparable with the tofacitinib treated Asian patient (7.6/100).<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, we think that more cautious consideration and measurement for this event are needed, after considering the safety results of ongoing phase III studies of peficitinib. Laboratory changes related to lipids (HDL and LDL), CPK, serum creatinine, platelet counts and neutrophil counts were observed, consistent with observations with the other JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Decreases in the platelet and neutrophil counts were thought to be related to the inhibition of the JAK signal pathway.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> However, a mean decrease in haemoglobin, which may attribute to JAK2 inhibition, was not observed even in the highest dose groups and mean haemoglobin levels were dose-dependently increased up to the highest dose in this 12-week treatment study.</p><p>In conclusion, peficitinib reduced RA symptoms statistically, and a dose response was observed in the ACR20 response rate. Peficitinib showed acceptable safety profile in short-term treatment of 12&#x02005;weeks. The findings of this phase IIb study support the two ongoing phase III studies of peficitinib for RA treatment option.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Web supplement</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2015-208279-s1.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1482" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank the patients who were involved in this study, and the study investigators and team staffs.
