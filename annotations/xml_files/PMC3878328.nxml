However, the desired reduction of ischemic event recurrence is accompanied by an increased incidence of bleeding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Initially tolerated as an inherent complication of anti-ischemic treatment, major bleeding is now recognized as a predictor of mortality and adverse ischemic outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In fact, NSTEACS patients who develop major bleeding have a two- to ten-fold increase in mortality after a one-year follow-up [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. In the Acute Catheterization and Urgent Intervention Triage Strategy (ACUITY) trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] involving 13,819 NSTEACS patients submitted to an early invasive strategy and randomized for antithrombotic treatment with unfractionated heparin (UFH) plus IIb-IIIa glycoprotein receptor inhibitor (GPI), bivalirudin plus GPI or bivalirudin alone, the prognostic impact of major bleeding was comparable to that of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) in subsequent mortality (11.7% versus 9.1%, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. Randomized clinical trials involving NSTEACS patients show major bleeding rates varying from 2% to 5% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], approaching the prevalence of refractory ischemia, AMI or deaths observed in these studies. A publication of the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Acute Coronary Treatment and Intervention Outcomes Network Registry Get with the Guidelines (NCDR ACTION Registry-GWTG) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>], a representative registry of real world practice, has evaluated 72,699 unselected patients with NSTEACS and 48,943 patients with ST-segment-elevation AMI evaluated at 360 North American hospitals between January 2007 and June 2009. Authors have reported a major bleeding rate of approximately 9% among NSTEACS patients and 12% among those with ST-segment-elevation AMI, primarily influenced by the presence of comorbidities such as older age, female gender, chronic renal failure, as well as the use of invasive techniques [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><sec><title>Bleeding and vascular complications related to arterial access</title><p>Because arterial puncture followed by sheath insertion using the modified Seldinger technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>] has become the standard method used to perform invasive cardiovascular procedures, vascular access has become a major site of bleeding complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. According to the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE), the most frequent bleeding sites were gastrointestinal (31.5%) and those related to vascular access (23.8%), with the latter being more prevalent among patients submitted to invasive strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In a joint analysis of 17,393 acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients submitted to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) and included in the studies Randomized Evaluation in PCI Linking Angiomax to Reduced Clinical Events (REPLACE) - 2, ACUITY and Harmonizing Outcomes with RevascularIZatiON and Stents in Acute Myocardial Infarction (HORIZONS-AMI), the bleeding prevalence by Thrombosis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) criteria was 5.3%, of which 2.1% (38.6%) were related to vascular access [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Strategies to prevent bleeding and vascular complications</title><sec><title>Radial technique</title><p>Among the strategies to decrease vascular complications after invasive coronary procedures, the radial approach is an established one [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Although it has been adopted by only a few centers, it provides more comfort to patients, allows early ambulation, decreases hospital stay and shows less vascular puncture site complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. In a comparative randomized trial between radial and femoral techniques involving 7,021 ACS patients submitted to invasive techniques, both techniques were shown to be safe and effective for PCI, with similar incidences of death, AMI, stroke and major bleeding at 30&#x000a0;days (3.7% versus 4.0%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.50) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. However, the radial approach displayed significantly decreased vascular complications, including pseudoaneurysm, large hematomas, arterio-venous fistula and limb ischemia requiring surgical intervention (1.4% versus 3.7%; <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.0001).</p><p>Given the small number of training centers that use the radial technique, the uncertainties concerning the learning curve which would be associated with a higher failure rate and more radiological exposure, and the lack of large-scale multicenter studies that can reproduce the excellent results obtained by highly experienced centers, the femoral approach remains the most popular for invasive coronary procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Percutaneous vascular closure devices</title><p>Although the real prognostic significance of preventing vascular access complications and minor bleedings has not yet been established, the occurrence of vascular access complications is associated with poor patient adherence to the antiplatelet therapy after hospital discharge and is a major and known predictor of ischemic complication recurrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. Strategies to decrease femoral access vascular complications have been frequently evaluated and implemented, such as the use of smaller diameter endovascular devices, early arterial sheath removal, fluoroscopy or ultrasound-guided femoral puncture and the choice of antithrombotic agents with better safety profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>].</p><p>Since 1995, percutaneous femoral vascular closure devices (VCD) were introduced to decrease vascular complications, hemostasis and ambulation times of patients submitted to invasive procedures by femoral access. Although these devices have been rapidly incorporated into interventionist practice, they have shown conflicting results regarding their safety and efficacy, motivating a class III recommendation as a strategy to decrease vascular complications in a recent position taken by the American Heart Association [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>Three meta-analyses that compared VCD and manual compression from 2004 have reported conflicting results regarding their safety. Koreny <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>] grouped data from 30 randomized trials involving 4,000 patients and showed a decrease of 17&#x000a0;minutes to obtain hemostasis with VCD, at the expense of a non-significant increase in hematomas, bleeding, arterio-venous fistulas and pseudoaneurysms. Nikolsky <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] identified 30 randomized and observational studies in 37,066 patients where VCD were associated with increased vascular complications compared with manual compression, particularly using the VasoSeal (Datascope Corp., Montvale, NJ) device. Conversely, Vaitkus <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>] described in a meta-analysis involving 15 randomized trials and 5,084 patients a decrease in vascular complications favoring the new technology, particularly when using AngioSeal (St. Jude Medical, St. Paul, MN) and Perclose (Abbott Vascular, Redwood City, CA) devices, an observation that has been validated by results of large multicenter observational registries published subsequently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>In summary, different VCD, although not demonstrating a class effect, clearly provide more comfort to patients, decreasing hemostasis and bed rest time. However, the inconsistency of data proving their safety limits their routine adoption as a strategy to prevent vascular complications, requiring evidence through adequately designed randomized studies. The hypothesis of this investigation is that among NSTEACS patients submitted to an early invasive strategy and randomized to the femoral or radial approach, the percutaneous femoral vascular closure device would decrease the prevalence of vascular complications at the puncture site, thus fulfilling the non-inferiority criteria compared with radial access.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>The ARISE study</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>ARISE is a national, multicenter, non-inferiority randomized clinical trial comparing the radial versus femoral approach using VCD to decrease vascular complications related to an arterial puncture site among NSTEACS patients submitted to an early invasive strategy (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Immediately after procedure completion, the sheath is initially pulled by approximately 2&#x000a0;cm. The device is applied to the patient with the green marker (located in the center of the larger balloon) positioned exactly at the puncture hole to aid in the location, visualization and control of possible bleeding. The balloon is inflated with an adequate syringe injecting 15&#x000a0;mL of air with simultaneous and total sheath removal, resulting in the absence of active bleeding. From the fourth hour and at each subsequent hour (fifth and sixth hours), 5&#x000a0;mL of air is slowly removed, maintaining the balloon connected to the syringe and controlling the plunger with the thumb. If bleeding occurs during any stage of device removal, the volume of air needed for homeostasis is again injected, repeating the process 60&#x000a0;minutes later. If device failure occurs, homeostasis will be obtained using a compressive dressing with a porous elastic adhesive bandage (Tensoplast, Smith &#x00026; Nephew, London, UK).</p></sec><sec><title>Femoral approach</title><p>The AngioSeal VCD, comprising an absorbable collagen sponge and absorbable polymer anchor with polylactic and polyglycolic acid connected by an absorbable self-adjustable suture, will be used for hemostasis. The device seals the arteriotomy hole between its two major components, the anchor and collagen sponge. Hemostasis is primarily obtained through mechanical means that is supplemented by collagen platelet aggregation-inducing properties. The device will be released according to the manufacturer&#x02019;s recommendations. First, an insertion introducer together with a femoral artery arteriotomy hole locator will be positioned using a 0.035-inch-guidewire. Once blood reflow by the distal edge of the set is confirmed, the guidewire and insertion introducer are removed, keeping the arteriotomy locator in position. Next, the repair and hemostasis device are inserted through the locator, exposing the anchor in the intraluminal space. The retreat of this second set places the anchor against the internal puncture hole. Maintaining the retreat, the collagen sponge is then released in the external puncture hole at the same time that the anchor is sustained, resulting in effective and safe hemostasis by preventing intra-arterial collagen release. Total set removal is achieved using an absorbable suture wrapped in a plastic tube to manually compact the collagen sponge against the arterial wall. After the appearance of an opaque mark, the suture is cut, the compacting tube exerting compression may be removed, and the remaining suture is cut close to the skin. If the device fails, homeostasis will be obtained by manual compression. Patients will be allowed to walk immediately after the radial procedure, and one hour after bed rest in the supine position after the femoral procedure with AngioSeal.</p><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> illustrates possible antithrombotic treatment.

Twenty additional patients may be added to the final population to correct any subsequent loss of follow-up. This non-inferiority margin was derived from a trial that demonstrate the benefit of radial approach on the reduction of major vascular complications (hazard ratio, 0.37; 95% confidence interval, 0.27 to 0.52) as compared with femoral approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. The non-inferiority margin of 0.15 was chosen in order to avoid a loss of greater than half the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval (0.27).
