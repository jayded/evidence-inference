The majority of randomized controlled trials and other studies have shown substantially reduced neurocognitive impairment when an ultrabrief pulse width of approximately 0.3 milliseconds (ms) was used compared with a brief pulse width (0.5&#x02013;2.0ms; <xref rid="CIT0022" ref-type="bibr">Pisvejc et al., 1998</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Mayur et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Spaans, Verwijk, et al., 2013</xref>). However, results from some studies also suggest that efficacy may be reduced, with lower response and remission rates, slower speed of improvement, and a greater number of treatments required (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">2012</xref>, <xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">2013</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Niemantsverdriet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Spaans, Verwijk, et al., 2013</xref>). In this double-blind, randomized controlled trial, ultrabrief pulse right unilateral (RUL) ECT dosed at 8 times seizure threshold was compared with brief-pulse RUL ECT dosed at 5 times seizure threshold. The dose for RUL ECT was informed by our prior research (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2008</xref>) and we estimated that RUL ECT at 8 times seizure threshold would be required to achieve comparable efficacy. We hypothesized that, when given at a higher relative dosage level, ultrabrief pulse RUL ECT would result in comparable efficacy to brief-pulse RUL ECT, but retain cognitive benefits. A related but separate study of bilateral ECT using the same overall study design (also registered under NCT00870805) will be reported separately.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3"><title>Study Design</title><p>Depressed inpatients from Wesley Hospital, the Melbourne Clinic, and St George Hospital (Sites) who were prescribed RUL ECT by their treating psychiatrists were assessed for trial inclusion. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants, and the trial was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committees of the University of New South Wales, the Melbourne Clinic, and South Eastern Sydney Illawarra Area Health Service. The trial followed a prospective, double-blind, parallel-group experimental design. Using a computer-generated random number sequence, stratified by trial site, participants were randomly assigned to receive RUL ECT with a brief (1.0ms) or ultrabrief pulse width (0.3ms). At doses of 500&#x02013;1000 milliCoulombs, pulse width had to be increased to a maximum of 0.7ms in order to achieve higher absolute electrical doses because of machine limitations. ECT treatment condition was indicated on treatment sheets by a code, such that participants, their treating psychiatrist, and all clinical staff, other than the psychiatrist administering ECT, were blind to treatment assignment. All participants remained under the care of their own treating psychiatrist during the trial period, and decisions concerning the number of ECT treatments received, the decision to switch electrode placements, and concurrent medications were determined clinically by that psychiatrist.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Sample Size</title><p>The minimum sample size required for this study was calculated in two ways. Firstly, a non-inferiority analysis was undertaken, based on the assumption that a difference in end-of-treatment depression scores of 25% or less between the ultrabrief and brief pulse&#x02013;width groups would not be of high clinical significance. End of ECT depression score for brief pulse RUL ECT was estimated at 10 (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale), based on data from a prior randomized, double-blind trial (<xref rid="CIT0014" ref-type="bibr">McCall et al., 2002</xref>). If there were 42 subjects per group the upper limit of the 95% confidence interval would fall below the maximal value consistent with non-inferiority. Secondly, a power analysis based on expected differences in retrograde amnesia between the two groups was conducted. In the trial of <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al. (2008)</xref>, brief and ultrabrief RUL ECT groups differed in outcomes on the Columbia Autobiographical Memory Interview by approximately 0.8 standardized units (<italic>z</italic>-scores). As our study examined ultrabrief ECT at higher doses relative to seizure threshold, a smaller (though still important) difference between the two groups in retrograde amnesia scores was expected. Power analysis based on a difference equivalent to an effect size of 0.6 found that 45 subjects per group would be required to have an 80% chance of showing this difference at <italic>p</italic> = 0.05. Allowing for 10% dropouts, the study aimed to recruit a minimum sample of 99 participants.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Participants</title><p>One hundred and two psychiatric inpatients were recruited for this study with the following inclusion criteria: aged &#x02265;18 years; DSM-IV Major Depressive Episode; Montgomery-&#x000c5;sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; <xref rid="CIT0017" ref-type="bibr">Montgomery and Asberg, 1979</xref>) score &#x02265;25; no diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, or rapid cycling bipolar disorder; no ECT in the last 3 months; no drug or alcohol abuse or dependence in the last 6 months; no past or current neurological illness or injury; score &#x02267;24 on Mini Mental State Examination; English proficiency sufficient to undertake cognitive testing.</p><p content-type="indent">The intention-to-treat sample comprised 95 participants who received at least one ECT treatment and had at least one post-baseline mood rating (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Figure 1</xref> Consort diagram).

Secondly&#x02014;once reoriented&#x02014;they were tested on recall of six words learned 5&#x02013;10 minutes prior to ECT treatment, and recognition of eight faces learned 5&#x02013;10 minutes prior to ECT treatment.

Response was defined as &#x02265;50% improvement in MADRS scores over the treatment course and remission was defined as MADRS &#x0003c;10 after the final ECT.

A possible influence on the main results is that of missing data. For example, across weeks 1&#x02013;4 some 34% of data points are missing, and of these 90% follow dropout, which, in almost all cases, is due to improvement. These data are not missing at random we cannot ignore the implications. Models for change over time which incorporate information about dropout have been proposed (<xref rid="CIT0004" ref-type="bibr">Enders, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0018" ref-type="bibr">Muthen et al., 2011</xref>).

Estimates of the key regression&#x02014;linear trend on type of ECT&#x02014;remained quite similar in size and non-significance across the models, suggesting that the dropout due to improvement was not affecting the estimates.</p><p content-type="indent">Covariates were selected based on their predictive utility in univariate analyses of variance (ANOVAs) with MADRS scores after the third ECT, after the sixth ECT, and after the final ECT used as dependent variables.

Following this, age, study site, number of ECT treatments received, melancholic features, psychotic features, Maudsley treatment resistance score, whether participants were taking a benzodiazepine during their ECT course, and commencement of a new antidepressant during the course were included as covariates. Number of adequate antidepressant courses failed, whether participants were taking an antidepressant during their ECT course, commencement of a new antidepressant medication during the ECT course, and polarity of depression were assessed but not included.</p><p content-type="indent">To examine whether there were any differences in mood outcomes at specific time points, between-subject analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs) were used to examine change in MADRS scores at Week 1, Week 2, after the final ECT and at one week, one month, and six month follow-ups, controlling for the same covariates in addition to baseline MADRS score. The proportion of responders and remitters in each group were compared using chi-square tests.</p><p content-type="indent">To investigate differences in performance on the cognitive test battery at set time points, ANCOVAs were analyzed for all tests except the AMI-SF using scores after six ECT treatments, at the end of the treatment course, one month, and six months after the end of the treatment course, controlling for baseline test score, MADRS score at time of testing, and predicted premorbid IQ; ANCOVAs of test results after the end of the treatment course also controlled for the number of ECT treatments. AMI-SF scores were analyzed similarly, except that consistency scores (% consistency of recall of answers reported at pre-ECT baseline) were analyzed instead of raw scores controlling for baseline scores. Acute word recall and recognition of faces at the third and sixth ECT treatments were analyzed using ANCOVAs controlling for pre-ECT immediate word recall and face recognition.

To date, three randomized controlled trials have compared ultrabrief- and brief-pulse RUL ECT at the same dose relative to seizure threshold (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Mayur et al., 2013</xref>; Spaans, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Verwijk, et al., 2013</xref>). The largest study (Spaans, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Verwijk, et al., 2013</xref>) found slightly lesser efficacy in the ultrabrief pulse group, whereas the two smaller studies (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Mayur et al., 2013</xref>) found no significant difference. Possible explanations are that inadequate power in the smaller studies accounted for the lack of significant differences found, or that differences in study sample characteristics may explain apparent discrepancies between findings. For example, participants who are highly ECT responsive (older age, psychotic depression; <xref rid="CIT0009" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2011</xref>; Spaans, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Koh, et al., 2013</xref>) are likely to respond well to either ultrabrief- or brief-pulse RUL ECT, with no difference in outcomes, whereas differences in treatment outcomes may be more evident in less ECT-responsive participants. Data from a prospective non-randomized study (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2008</xref>), naturalistic reports (<xref rid="CIT0021" ref-type="bibr">Niemantsverdriet et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0010" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2012</xref>), and a large clinical sample (<xref rid="CIT0006" ref-type="bibr">Galletly et al., 2013</xref>) also suggest slightly reduced efficacy for ultrabrief-pulse RUL ECT, even when it was given at a slightly higher dosage compared to brief-pulse RUL ECT. Finally, a formal speed-of-response analysis suggested that more treatments are required to attain response when an ultrabrief pulse was used in RUL ECT (<xref rid="CIT0011" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p content-type="indent">The current study used a different dosing approach for the two treatments, to test if the cognitive advantage for ultrabrief-pulse RUL ECT reported in earlier studies would still be demonstrated when it was given at a dose level likely to achieve comparable efficacy to brief-pulse RUL ECT: i.e., a proof-of-concept test of whether overall efficacy/cognitive effects outcomes are superior. The higher dosage relative to seizure threshold (eight times versus five times) did indeed lead to comparable efficacy between the groups, with no difference found in mean changes in depression scores, proportion of responders and remitters, or speed of response (number of ECT treatments required, comparison of depression scores at time points across the ECT course).</p><p content-type="indent">Overall, response and remission rates are lower than those reported in other randomized controlled trials of ultrabrief RUL ECT (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0012" ref-type="bibr">Mayur et al., 2013</xref>; Spaans, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Verwijk, et al., 2013</xref>). Several factors may explain this. The sample in this study may be less ECT responsive. For example, a lower percentage of this sample had psychotic depression, compared with the Sackeim and Spaans studies (<xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2008</xref>; Spaans, <xref rid="CIT0028" ref-type="bibr">Verwijk, et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, the decision to end the ECT course based on clinical judgement rather than predetermined remission criteria (as in the Sackeim and Spaans studies) may have led to premature termination of ECT for some participants (<xref rid="CIT0023" ref-type="bibr">Prudic et al., 2004</xref>). It is possible that the overall lower response and remission rates may have masked any efficacy differences between the treatment groups.</p><p content-type="indent">The follow-up data on mood outcomes should be interpreted with caution, given the attrition in sample numbers and presence of naturalistic clinical care over the follow-up period. Nevertheless, the data provide preliminary support for meaningful clinical improvement with ultrabrief-pulse RUL ECT that outlasts the immediate treatment period.</p></sec><sec id="s16"><title>Cognitive Outcomes</title><p>Better memory functioning was demonstrated in the ultrabrief group. This was evident in testing of acute post-ECT effects at sessions three and six. The ultrabrief group was significantly better at recall of words and recognition of faces learnt prior to ECT, and faster in attaining reorientation after ECT.</p><p content-type="indent">Of all the domains of cognitive functioning tested in the main cognitive battery (orientation, processing speed, fronto-executive function, verbal and visual anterograde memory, retrograde autobiographical memory) the ultrabrief group had superior outcomes only in orientation and retrograde autobiographical memory. This is, however, an important finding, as loss of past personal memories can be persistent and often is the side effect of most concern to patients (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2007</xref>). It should be noted that the ultrabrief group had a slightly higher premorbid IQ at study outset, which may have reduced their susceptibility to cognitive impairment with ECT (<xref rid="CIT0024" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2007</xref>). The analyses accounted for this baseline difference, but it is nevertheless an important caveat in the interpretation of cognitive results.</p><p content-type="indent">Overall, this study supports prior reports that ultrabrief-pulse ECT is associated with better cognitive outcomes (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2008</xref>), though increasing the dosage of ultrabrief-pulse RUL ECT relative to brief-pulse RUL ECT diminished its overall cognitive advantage, as reflected in the lack of significant differences in the majority of cognitive outcomes, in contrast to earlier reports, which also found superior outcomes in global cognitive performance and anterograde memory function (<xref rid="CIT0008" ref-type="bibr">Loo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="CIT0025" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s17"><title>Seizure Threshold</title><p>Seizure threshold increased by 57% in the ultrabrief group and by 19% in the brief pulse group over the first six treatments. The difference may be related to the different dosage levels used for treatment (i.e., treating at a higher relative suprathreshold dose, eight times versus five times, may lead to a more rapid rise in seizure threshold). Importantly, this finding suggests that ECT practitioners may need to consider dose increases across a course of ultrabrief-pulse RUL ECT in order to maintain sufficiently suprathreshold dosing, as this study demonstrates that substantial increases in seizure threshold may occur.</p></sec><sec id="s18"><title>Limitations and Strengths</title><p>A limitation of the study is that electrode placement, concurrent medications, and number of ECT treatments were determined clinically rather than by operationalized criteria. Although the statistical analyses controlled for these factors, it is possible that this may have biased study results. Loss to follow-up after the acute treatment period limits the study&#x02019;s capacity to address potential differences in durability of benefit and in long-term cognitive effects. Strengths of the study include the relatively large sample size and the detailed cognitive testing.</p><p content-type="indent">Overall, this study supports the hypothesis that, when given at adequate dosing, ultrabrief-pulse RUL ECT may have comparable efficacy to brief-pulse RUL ECT, but with lesser cognitive side effects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s19"><title>Supplementary Material</title><p>For supplementary material accompanying this paper, visit <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ijnp.oxfordjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1093/ijnp/pyu045/-/DC1">http://www.ijnp.oxfordjournals.org/</ext-link>
