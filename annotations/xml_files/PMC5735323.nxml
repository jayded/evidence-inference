It is a sham-controlled trial in which 30 eligible patients will be randomly allocated in a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio to one of three groups: verum acupuncture (VA) group 1 (3 times weekly for 4 weeks); VA group 2 (twice weekly for 4 weeks); or sham acupuncture group (SA; twice weekly for 4 weeks). SA will consist of nonpenetrating acupuncture. Outcome measures will include the Visual Analogue Scale for itch, SCORing Atopic Dermatitis, and Eczema Area and Severity Index to evaluate AD symptoms improvement along with the Patient Oriented Eczema Measure and Dermatology Life Quality Index to assess quality of life. Measures will be collected at baseline, once weekly during the treatment period, and after a 4-week follow-up period. Blood collection will be at baseline and 4 and 8 weeks after treatment and compared with healthy controls. Illumina sequencing will be used to profile microRNA expression in each group to explore candidate microRNA biomarkers for specific effects of acupuncture in patients with AD.

Background</title><p>The prevalence of atopic dermatitis (AD), a chronic relapsing inflammatory skin disease characterized by eczematous and intensely pruritic skin lesions [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], is increasing worldwide [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. In South Korea, about 13% of children and 3% of adults were reported to be diagnosed with AD in a 2008&#x02013;2011 survey [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Pruritus associated with AD often induces sleeping problems and patients with AD frequently complain of a lowered health-related quality of life; for example, daily activities and/or personal relationships may be restricted [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>].</p><p>First-line therapy of AD is based on the use of emollients and other systemic and/or topical treatments: topical corticosteroid (TCS) and calcineurin inhibitors are recommended as topical management; antimicrobials, systemic immune-modulators, allergen-specific immunotherapy, and phototherapy are used for systemic management [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. However, other complementary and alternative therapies are commonly used by many patients with AD when conventional treatments yield unsatisfactory relief or produce side effects [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>In Korea, patients with AD have frequently used Traditional Korean Medicine, such as acupuncture and herbal medicine, for symptom management [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; however, there have been only a small number of clinical studies of AD treatment with acupuncture and herbal medicine and even fewer studies investigating the therapeutic effect of acupuncture alone [<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. This may explain why a recent systematic review failed to include any randomised clinical trials (RCTs) of acupuncture as treatment of AD [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Nevertheless, previous reports have demonstrated that acupuncture exerts an antipruritic effect on pruritogen-induced scratching behaviour in an animal model and on allergen-induced itch in patients with AD [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Considering its potential antipruritic effect, this highlights the need for rigorously designed and conducted trials in acupuncture field [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>To overcome some weaknesses of previous studies and to determine whether acupuncture helps AD symptom management, we will conduct a randomised, sham-controlled feasibility trial comparing two different doses of active acupuncture treatment with a sham acupuncture control. We aim to establish the feasibility of recruitment and to determine key features, including optimal acupuncture treatment dose and outcome measures, to inform a large-scale RCT in patients with AD. Additionally, we will explore novel biomarker candidates that may be associated with the antipruritic effect of acupuncture.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2.

Randomisation and Allocation Concealment</title><p>After signing the written consent, participants will undergo a screening test to confirm eligibility. The baseline characteristics including demographics, physical examination, medical history, and severity of AD signs will be used to screen the eligible participants according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Individuals with AD will be randomly assigned to one of three groups via block randomisation. Healthy volunteers will not be assigned to a treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>An independent statistician will produce random numbers with the PROC PLAN of SAS 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) and transfer them to the Acupuncture and Meridian Science Research Centre (AMSRC) at Kyung Hee University, where each random number will be sealed in a sequentially numbered opaque envelope by a staff member who is otherwise not involved in this study.</p><p>At the beginning of the randomisation process, the investigator will call the independent staff in the AMSRC to receive the screening number of the participant. Then the AMSRC staff screening ID and treatment assignment will be documented in the trial master file.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.7"><title>2.7. Blinding and Code Breaking</title><p>Participants and the outcome assessor will be blinded to the treatment allocation in this trial. Since it is impossible to blind the Korean Medicine Doctors (KMDs) who will give acupuncture treatments, they will be excluded from performing the outcome measurements or analysing data. To ensure participant blinding, an eye patch will be applied to patients during the acupuncture treatment, and they will be unable to see the practice procedures. All the acupuncture treatments, regardless of group assignment, will utilise the Park sham device (AcuPrime Co., Ltd., Exeter, UK), which is applied at the acupoints to block participants from seeing whether or not the acupuncture needles penetrate the skin [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. The acupuncture needles and device will be maintained in place for 15&#x02009;min in all treatment groups. If a participant has a serious adverse event and immediate cessation of acupuncture treatment is required, the blinding code will be broken.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8"><title>2.8. Interventions</title><sec id="sec2.8.1"><title>2.8.1. Acupuncture Treatment</title><p>The acupuncture treatments were based on the revised STandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture (STRICTA) 2010 recommendations (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>) [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Both manual acupuncture and intradermal acupuncture treatment will be given. The acupuncture protocols reflect everyday clinical practice in Korean Medicine.</p><p>In this study, manual acupuncture treatment is composed of fixed acupuncture treatment and additional acupuncture treatment: partially individualised acupuncture treatment will be performed on the basis of the traditional meridian theory and consensus by experts in acupuncture and AD. The number of applied acupoints per patient per session ranges from 6 to 19: 6 basic points and 10 optional points (3 optional points can be applied bilaterally). All participants with AD will receive acupuncture needling at 6 fixed points: LI11, ST36, and PC6, bilaterally. The optional points include ST43, GB41, LI2, TE3, SI3, TE6, SI2, BL66, LR3, and SP3. The optional acupoints will be added in accordance with individual signs or symptoms, contralaterally to the applied signs or symptoms: ST43 and GB41 for gastric stuffiness or dyspepsia; LI2 and GB41 for tenderness around ST25, diarrhoea, or constipation; TE3 and SI3 for fullness in the chest and hypochondrium; TE3 and TE6 for lower abdominal pain plus tenderness on the chest centre; SI3 and GB41 or SI2 and BL66 for lower abdominal pain, dry skin, or heat in the upper body and cold in the lower body; and LR3 and SP3 for pain in hypogastric region with darkness of the sublingual collateral vessels. A study coordinator will ask participants about symptoms that might require additional acupuncture treatment to reduce the bias. Regardless of group assignment, all manual acupuncture treatment will be performed using Park sham devices to maintain participant blinding. The acupuncture treatment will be done with disposable sterilised stainless needles (40&#x02009;mm length and 0.25&#x02009;mm diameter; Dongbang Acupuncture Inc., Bundang, Seongnam, Korea) or Park sham acupuncture needles (AcuPrime Co., Ltd., Exeter, UK) according to the assigned groups. Manipulation technique will be performed to elicit &#x0201c;de qi&#x0201d; sensation. The needle will be inserted up to 5 to 30&#x02009;mm depending on acupoints and retained for 15 minutes.</p><p>After removal of needles, intradermal needles using 1.5&#x02009;mm press tack needles (Haeng Lim Seo Won Medical Co., Korea) will be given to three acupoints per participant per session: LI11 bilaterally and auricular-Shenmen contralaterally. This is aimed at mitigating AD-related pruritus with LI11 and reducing anxiety level with auricular-Shenmen [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>, <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Participants will be instructed by study staff to press the applied press tack needles located on LI11 for 3 minutes when they feel severe pruritus.</p><p>All acupuncture treatments will be carried out by the same KMD, who was trained for 10 hours to guarantee that he could perform the acupuncture treatments identically according to the predefined protocol.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8.2"><title>2.8.2. Verum Acupuncture Group 1 (VA1)</title><p>Participants assigned to the VA1 will receive 12 acupuncture sessions over 4 weeks, that is, 3 days/week. A telephone interview will take place two weeks after the end of treatment to collect data on the severity of pruritus symptoms, amount of TCS used, and adverse effects. Participants' final visit will occur 4 weeks after the end of treatment. No other intervention will be permitted during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8.3"><title>2.8.3. Verum Acupuncture Group 2 (VA2)</title><p>Participants assigned to the VA2 will receive 8 acupuncture sessions over 4 weeks, that is, 2 days/week. A telephone interview will be given two weeks after the end of treatment to collect data on the severity of pruritus symptoms, amount of TCS used, and adverse effects. Participants' final visit will occur 4 weeks after the end of treatment. No other intervention will be permitted during the study period.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.8.4"><title>2.8.4. Sham Acupuncture Group (SA)</title><p>Participants assigned to the SA group will receive 8 acupuncture sessions over 4 weeks, that is, 2 days/week. Sham acupuncture treatment will be conducted on 6 control points: a point 1 to 2&#x02009;cm proximal and 1&#x02009;cm medial to LI7, a point 1&#x02009;cm proximal and 1&#x02009;cm medial to LI11, and a point 1&#x02009;cm proximal and 1&#x02009;cm lateral to ST36, each bilaterally. Instead of intradermal needles, the same sized stainless steel rings without needles, that is, nonpenetrating intradermal needles, which were designed and validated for blinding for our study, will be attached to three control points: a point 1&#x02009;cm proximal and 1&#x02009;cm medial to LI11, bilaterally, and finger point in the ear, contralaterally [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. Unlike VA1 and VA2, fixed acupuncture treatments will be given, but questions about symptoms, TCS, and adverse effects will be asked to participants in this group. A telephone interview will also be given two weeks after the end of treatment to collect data on the severity of pruritus symptoms, amount of TCS used, and adverse effects. After the 4-week treatment period, participants will return for a final visit at 4 weeks after the end of treatment, identical to VA1 and VA2.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec2.9"><title>2.9. Compliance and Discontinuation</title><p>During the study period, each patient will receive either 12 or 8 treatment sessions according to their group assignment. Since frequent hospital visits may be the burden to participants and may induce them to withdraw from the trial, we identified a minimum number of treatments to be considered compliant, as follows: at least 10 sessions of 12 should be completed for VA1, and at least 6 sessions of 8 should be completed for VA2 and SA. For dropouts who did not fulfil the aforementioned compliance criteria, last available data will be taken for the analysis.</p><p>The study coordinator will maintain regular contact and encourage participants to complete all treatment sessions and follow-up visits. Should a participant withdraw consent, any data collected from the participant will be kept in files safely for 3 years and then will be discarded.</p></sec><sec id="sec2.10"><title>2.10. Outcome Measures</title><p>One research nurse who is otherwise not involved in this study will conduct a series of outcome measures: its schedule is depicted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab2">Table 2</xref>. There will be no separation between primary and secondary outcomes since it is an exploratory study to evaluate the independent effectiveness of acupuncture to treat AD and to collect outcome data for further study.</p><p>Participants with AD will complete all the outcome measures; healthy controls will submit to blood collection and complete the Cold-Heat, Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale (CES-D), and state-trait anger expression inventory (STAXI) questionnaires.</p><sec id="sec2.10.1"><title>2.10.1. SCORAD Index</title><p>SCORAD is a widely used tool for assessing severity of AD.

The SCORAD index contains 6 items to evaluate AD intensity: erythema, excoriation, oedema or papulation, lichenification, oozing or crust, and dryness. The extent of the lesions is evaluated as a percentage of entire external surface of the human body with the rule of nine. The SCORAD grades the intensity and extent of affected skin and the participant rates their subjective symptoms with VAS (0 = no itch or sleep loss, to 10 = worst imaginable itch or sleep loss).</p></sec><sec id="sec2.10.2"><title>2.10.2. Itch VAS</title><p>The itch VAS is one of the components of the SCORAD index, and it will be particularly applied to assess the severity and reduction of pruritus in this trial. Participants whose itch VAS score is less than 30 or higher than 80 will be excluded because we assumed that they will have lower desire for antipruritic therapy or need more potent treatment [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2.10.3"><title>2.10.3.

We will utilise an algometer to standardise and quantitatively describe the abdominal examination [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Using an algometer (Wagner Instruments, Greenwich, CT), one operator will apply pressure to 3 acupoints (CV17, CV12, and ST25) vertically against the surface.

Discussion</title><p>A recent systematic review failed to identify any RCTs on acupuncture as treatment for AD, as it has not been extensively researched [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We describe a protocol for a randomised, sham-controlled feasibility trial comparing two VA groups with different treatment schedules with SA to assess the effectiveness of acupuncture in individuals with AD, to be conducted in clinical settings in Korea. The aims are to evaluate whether the proposed acupuncture treatments warrant further investigation for improvement of symptoms, mental health, and quality of life and whether a relationship can be established between certain biomolecules and the development of AD by comparing levels in the blood of individuals with AD to healthy controls.</p><p>Determining an optimal dose of acupuncture treatment involves complex decision making [<xref rid="B68" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>, <xref rid="B69" ref-type="bibr">69</xref>]. Clinical practice and patients' acceptability should be carefully considered when comparing two different dosages/schedules (3 days weekly versus 2 days weekly for 4 weeks). Our study results will elucidate which regimen produces maximal effectiveness and which schedule participants prefer, which is of importance to practitioners and educators.</p><p>We will limit enrolment to individuals with mild to moderate AD. Since KMDs usually treat severe cases with more intensive combinations of treatment, such as acupuncture and herbal medicine or acupuncture and hospitalisation, we selected acupuncture alone in order to detect differences between treatments without introducing other confounders; in addition, rescue medication will be permitted as we believe that this strategy reflects real world practice.</p><p>A battery of outcome measures will be used in our study since it is exploratory in nature. We will investigate the effects of acupuncture treatment on AD symptom improvement with a particular focus on antipruritic effect, measured using itch VAS, SCORAD, EASI, and POEM. Information on rescue medication use and quality of life will also be collected. For pattern identification in Korean Medicine, the AD pattern and Cold-Heat questionnaires, along with PPT, will be administered. CES-D and STAXI will examine potential anxiolytic and stress-relieving effects of acupuncture. Through credibility testing, the feasibility of participant blinding to treatment assignment will be thoroughly examined. Some may argue that nonspecific effects may unnecessarily increase in our trial by the increased attention due to a variety of outcome measures. The outcome measures, however, will be given to the participants in all three groups which will make it unlikely for one specific group to experience a larger nonspecific benefit due to the increased attention. We will nevertheless carefully examine whether there will be additional nonspecific benefits in any group and the feasible outcome measures will be selected to work for a main trial. Finally, our study will provide valuable data regarding treatment of AD with acupuncture, but also relative to identifying potential biomarkers associated with its development.</p><p>Establishing an adequate sham control is essential in an RCT of acupuncture. We will utilise a nonpenetrating sham acupuncture and nonpenetrating intradermal needles as a control group, which receive sham treatment twice a week for 4 weeks. There has been a long debate about the specific effect of acupuncture: acupuncture works mainly via a placebo effect [<xref rid="B70" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]; or tested sham acupuncture controls so far may not be completely inert [<xref rid="B71" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>, <xref rid="B72" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. The sham control in our study was designed to minimise a specific physiological effect that may be induced by needle insertion and to avoid specific acupuncture points in the body and the ear. In addition, the number of treatment sessions in the control group was set as twice weekly to minimise other nonspecific benefits such as doctor-patient interaction and the Hawthorne effect; this is feasible due to appropriate blinding techniques.</p><p>Attempts have been made to identify biomarkers in order to measure the specific effects of acupuncture and to better understand its mechanism of action [<xref rid="B73" ref-type="bibr">73</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B75" ref-type="bibr">75</xref>], but no reliable marker has yet to be established due to the lack of sensitivity and/or specificity. Recently, attention has increasingly focused on serum circulating miRNAs as reliable noninvasive or minimally invasive biomarkers because they are abundant, extremely stable in blood, and differentially expressed in various diseases [<xref rid="B76" ref-type="bibr">76</xref>]. Hence, we propose exploring novel miRNA-based candidates in association with the antipruritic effect of acupuncture, providing new opportunities to identify valuable biomarkers for the specific effects of acupuncture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="supplementary-material-sec"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="f1"><caption><p>SPIRIT 2013 Checklist: Recommended items to address in a clinical trial protocol and related documents.</p></caption><media xlink:href="1926806.f1.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" orientation="portrait" id="d35e892" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This research was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea funded by the Korean Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (NRF-2015M3A9E052338).</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AD:</term><def><p>Atopic dermatitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AMSRC:</term><def><p>Acupuncture and Meridian Science Research Center</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ANOVA:</term><def><p>Analysis of variance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CES-D:</term><def><p>Centre for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Cold-Heat:</term><def><p>Cold-heat pattern identification based on diagnosis in Traditional Korean Medicine</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>EASI:</term><def><p>Eczema Area and Severity Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>DLQI:</term><def><p>Dermatology Life Quality Index</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ELISA:</term><def><p>Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPA:</term><def><p>Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>IA:</term><def><p>Intradermal acupuncture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>Itch VAS:</term><def><p>Visual Analogue Scale for itch</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>KMD:</term><def><p>Korean Medicine Doctor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MA:</term><def><p>Manual acupuncture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>miRNA:</term><def><p>MicroRNA</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>POEM:</term><def><p>Patient Oriented Eczema Measure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PPT:</term><def><p>Pain Pressure Threshold</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PTN:</term><def><p>Press tack needle</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SA:</term><def><p>Sham acupuncture group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SCORAD:</term><def><p>SCORing Atopic Dermatitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STAXI:</term><def><p>State-trait anger expression inventory</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>STRICTA:</term><def><p>STandards for Reporting Interventions in Clinical Trials of Acupuncture</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TCS:</term><def><p>Topical corticosteroid</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA:</term><def><p>Verum acupuncture group</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VAS:</term><def><p>Visual Analogue Scale</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA1:</term><def><p>Verum acupuncture group 1</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>VA2:</term><def><p>Verum acupuncture group 2.</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><sec><title>Ethical Approval</title><p>This study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee at Kyung Hee University Korean Medicine Hospital (KOMCIRB-160212-HRBR-004).
