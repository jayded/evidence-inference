In the USA, for example, the leading cause of death is coronary heart disease (CHD), a CVD in which narrowing of the heart's blood vessels by &#x0201c;atherosclerotic plaques&#x0201d; (fatty deposits that build up with age) slows the blood supply to the heart and may eventually cause a heart attack (myocardial infarction). Other types of CVD include stroke (in which atherosclerotic plaques interrupt the brain's blood supply) and heart failure (a condition in which the heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body). Smoking, high blood pressure, high blood levels of cholesterol (a type of fat), having diabetes, and being overweight all increase a person's risk of developing CVD. Tools such as the &#x0201c;Framingham risk calculator&#x0201d; take these and other risk factors into account to assess an individual's overall risk of CVD, which can be reduced by taking drugs to reduce blood pressure or cholesterol levels (for example, pravastatin) and by making lifestyle changes.</p></sec><sec id="s4f1a2"><title>Why Was This Study Done?</title><p>Inflammation (an immune response to injury) in the walls of blood vessels is thought to play a role in the development of atherosclerotic plaques. Consistent with this idea, several epidemiological studies (investigations of the causes and distribution of disease in populations) have shown that people with high circulating levels of markers of inflammation such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen are more likely to have a stroke or a heart attack (a CVD event) than people with low levels of these markers. Although these studies have generally lumped together fatal and nonfatal CVD events, some evidence suggests that circulating inflammatory markers may be more strongly associated with fatal than with nonfatal CVD events. If this is the case, the mechanisms that lead to fatal and nonfatal CVD events may be subtly different and knowing about these differences could improve both the prevention and treatment of CVD. In this study, the researchers investigate this possibility using data collected in the Prospective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk (PROSPER; a trial that examined pravastatin's effect on CVD development among 70&#x02013;82 year olds with pre-existing CVD or an increased risk of CVD because of smoking, high blood pressure, or diabetes).</p></sec><sec id="s4f1a3"><title>What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</title><p>The researchers used several statistical models to examine the association between baseline levels of IL-6, CRP, and fibrinogen in the trial participants and nonfatal CVD events (nonfatal heart attacks and nonfatal strokes), fatal CVD events, death from other types of CVD, and deaths from other causes during 3.2 years of follow-up. Increased levels of all three inflammatory markers were more strongly associated with fatal CVD than with nonfatal CVD after adjustment for treatment allocation and for other established CVD risk factors but this pattern was strongest for IL-6. Thus, a unit increase in the log of IL-6 levels increased the risk of fatal CVD by half but increased the risk of nonfatal CVD by significantly less. The researchers also investigated whether including these inflammatory markers in tools designed to predict an individual's CVD risk could improve the tool's ability to distinguish between individuals with a high and low risk. The addition of IL-6 to established risk factors, they report, increased this discriminatory ability for fatal CVD but not for nonfatal CVD.</p></sec><sec id="s4f1a4"><title>What Do These Findings Mean?</title><p>These findings indicate that, at least for the elderly at-risk patients who were included in PROSPER, inflammatory markers are more strongly associated with the risk of a fatal heart attack or stroke than with nonfatal CVD events. These findings need to be confirmed in younger populations and larger studies also need to be done to discover whether the same association holds when fatal heart attacks and fatal strokes are considered separately. Nevertheless, the present findings suggest that inflammation may specifically help to promote the development of serious, potentially fatal CVD and should stimulate improved research into the use of inflammation markers to predict risk of deaths from CVD.</p></sec><sec id="s4f1a5"><title>Additional Information</title><p>Please access these Web sites via the online version of this summary at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000099">http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1000099</ext-link>.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The MedlinePlus Encyclopedia has pages on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/007115.htm">coronary heart disease</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000726.htm">stroke</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000171.htm">atherosclerosis</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>MedlinePlus provides links to many other sources of information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/heartdiseases.html">heart diseases</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/vasculardiseases.html">vascular diseases</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/stroke.html">stroke</ext-link> (in English and Spanish)</p></list-item><list-item><p>Information for patients and caregivers is provided by the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=1200000">American Heart Association</ext-link> on all aspects of cardiovascular disease, including information on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4648">inflammation and heart disease</ext-link>

Recently we reported that whilst CRP was associated with subsequent combined nonfatal and fatal vascular events in the elderly at risk, the C-statistic was moderately (albeit significantly) increased with addition of CRP to traditional risk factors <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Sattar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

Obviously these CVD events share common aetiology, but the question may be asked as to whether the nature of the event differs only in severity or whether there are subtle differences in underlying mechanisms that lead to fatal events versus nonfatal outcomes. Insensitivities to such clinically important questions in many reports through study design, limited endpoint acquisition, and analysis may be one reason that acute phase response-associated inflammatory risk markers predict CVD events moderately in many prospective studies.</p><p>Comprehensive investigation of these questions is required to extend trends noted, but rarely commented upon, in other studies. For instance, in the Scottish Heart Health Study, plasma fibrinogen showed at least as strong an association with total mortality as with risk of CHD <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Woodward1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, a finding subsequently confirmed in the Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Similar findings have been reported for blood viscosity (of which fibrinogen is a determinant) <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Woodward2" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>, IL-6, and CRP <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Gruenewald1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. These potential differences and their implications are not widely appreciated by the vascular community. Additionally, simultaneous and comprehensive investigation of associations of these separate endpoints, including in particular separation of fatal and nonfatal CVD, with a range of inflammatory markers is required but is lacking. Potential differences may have implications both for our understanding of the role of inflammation in CVD aetiology, and for the development of future risk scores based on risk for fatal CVD events.</p><p>In PROSPER <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, a clinical trial of pravastatin in the elderly at risk, with more than 850 incident CVD events including 190 fatal CVD events, we had the potential to explore for differential associations of IL-6, CRP, and fibrinogen with subsequent prespecified vascular events (fatal versus nonfatal), as well as examine whether such associations were independent of traditional risk factors.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The protocol of PROSPER has been published elsewhere <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Shepherd2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>, and the methodology and outcome of the main trial has also been published <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Shepherd2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Participants</title><p>Between December 15, 1997, and May 7, 1999, we screened and enrolled individuals from Scotland, Ireland, and The Netherlands. Briefly, men and women aged 70&#x02013;82 y were recruited if they had either preexisting vascular disease (coronary, cerebral, or peripheral) or increased risk of such disease because of smoking, hypertension, or diabetes. Their plasma total cholesterol was required to be 4.0&#x02013;9.0 mmol/l and their triglyceride concentrations less than 6.0 mmol/l.

IL-6 was assayed on a saved biobank of baseline samples in 2007 using a high-sensitivity ELISA (R&#x00026; D Systems) with inter- and intra-assay CVs of &#x0003c;6&#x00025; and a sensitivity of &#x0003c;0.16 pg/ml.

All samples were processed by technicians blinded to the identity of samples, and results entered into a master database, which the PROSPER statistics division in Scotland (Robertson Centre, University of Glasgow) is custodian of.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>The distribution of IL-6 (pg/ml) and CRP (mg/dl) was positively skewed and a logarithmic transformation was used. Baseline characteristics were compared between participants with and without the primary endpoint (as defined in original study) using the two-sample <italic>t</italic>-test for continuous variables and the chi-squared test for categorical variables. The influence of IL-6, CRP, and fibrinogen on the endpoints of interest&#x02014;extended herein to include nonfatal CVD events, fatal CVD events, fatal other CV events, or non-CVD death&#x02014;were investigated using Kaplan-Meier curves (for IL-6) and Cox proportional hazards models, adjusting for randomized treatment and baseline covariates (continuous variables: age, low-density lipoprotein [LDL] cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein [HDL] cholesterol, blood pressure, BMI, log triglyceride; categorical variables: gender, country, smoking status, history of diabetes, use of antihypertensive therapy, history of CHD, history of peripheral arterial disease [PAD], and history of stroke or TIA). Log IL-6, log CRP, and fibrinogen were analysed by 1-unit increments within the population, and hence represent a continuous measure, providing maximum power for detecting an association. Results are reported as number (percentage [&#x00025;]) of events and hazard ratio (HR) of a given endpoint (95&#x00025; confidence interval [CI]) for each unit increment. The validity of the proportional hazards assumption was assessed by plots of Cox-Snell residuals and Martingale residuals with no evidence of significant departures observed. In addition, IL-6 associations with endpoints were also analysed by comparing extreme thirds of the population based on IL-6 expression in the whole cohort. A similar method was previously reported for CRP <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. A competing risks model was constructed to test the difference in the HRs for nonfatal versus fatal CVD events.

For the purpose of the present analysis, only the first event was included.</p><p>Baseline characteristics of participants who did and did not have a primary endpoint (defined in the original trial <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Shepherd2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> and previous CRP analysis <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Sattar1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> as &#x0201c;CHD or stroke death or nonfatal MI or stroke&#x0201d;) are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pmed-1000099-t001">Table 1</xref>. This table shows results broadly expected in an elderly at risk cohort, with significant differences between cases and noncases (i.e., those without an event) in many (but not all) conventional risk factors. Participants who had a primary vascular event during study follow-up were slightly older (6 mo on average), more likely to be male, and to have a history of diabetes, CHD, peripheral arterial disease, stroke or TIA, but less likely to have been taking pravastatin. Baseline HDL cholesterol, but not triglyceride or LDL cholesterol, were lower among subsequent cases. As expected, levels of IL-6 and CRP were also higher among the case than control population. Fibrinogen levels were not significantly different in the primary endpoint group. IL-6 concentrations were generally higher than levels seen in other middle-aged cohorts <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, but levels are in keeping with older age groups from a general population cross sectional study <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Welsh1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>, which is commensurate with the current cohort's general age and state of health.

Conventional risk factors predicted risk of fatal CVD (C-statistic 0.699) and fatal other CVD (0.698) to a similar degree, although the predictive ability for nonfatal CVD was lower (0.630). Addition of IL-6 to traditional risk factors did not significantly increase discriminative predictive ability in the nonfatal CVD group (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.20), although CRP did so modestly (&#x0002b;0.003, <italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.023).

The results show that IL-6, CRP, and to a lesser extent, fibrinogen are more closely linked to risk of fatal MI or stroke (i.e., fatal CVD) than to nonfatal vascular events in the elderly at risk. In other words, we suggest that inflammatory markers are linked more closely to risk of death from CVD causes than to risk of nonfatal CVD events. We believe our findings may be a key feature of the inflammatory-vascular risk paradigm, which has been previously overlooked in the literature, but one that may have both important biological, clinical, and health implications.</p><sec id="s4a"><title>PROSPER Results in Context of the Literature</title><p>Our key observation of a stronger link of inflammatory markers with fatal CVD compared to nonfatal CVD significantly extends suggestive (but inconclusive) observations from previous reports, including studies in middle-aged and elderly individuals <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Woodward1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Clarke1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Lowe1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Woodward3" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, of potentially stronger associations between inflammatory markers with CVD death. While the body of evidence from these other studies has alluded to this possibility, our study is the first we are aware of to systematically and simultaneously show inflammatory markers (including IL-6 and CRP) are more strongly associated with fatal than nonfatal vascular events. We therefore suggest that combining both fatal and nonfatal CVD events as a single endpoint may make inappropriate assumptions about a common aetiology, whereas in reality subtle but important differences in risk factor patterns, perhaps particularly with regard to inflammatory markers, exist.</p><p>We note that the significantly stronger association with fatal CVD was particularly marked for IL-6 in PROSPER, which is a novel observation. Our results for fibrinogen are consistent with and significantly extend a previous report from the Fibrinogen Studies Collaboration; the results section reports a borderline (<italic>p</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.05) higher HR of 2.68 (95&#x00025; CI 2.36&#x02013;3.03) per 1 g/l increase in fibrinogen for risk for fatal CHD compared with an HR of 2.30 (95&#x00025; CI 2.10&#x02013;2.52) for risk of a nonfatal MI <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh3" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, but there was no further discussion on this finding. Interestingly, we found fibrinogen to be the least discriminatory between fatal and nonfatal CVD, and IL-6 to be most discriminatory. A similar collaborative meta-analysis of individual prospective data for CRP did not explore such differences, but does discuss the possibility of early publication bias in the CRP literature <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. Of note, earlier prospective studies for CRP were more likely to include only fatal CVD endpoints than later studies <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Harris1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Jager1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Strandberg1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, perhaps helping to explain some of the stronger associations seen for CRP with CVD outcomes in earlier reports. Furthermore, this phenomenon may not be limited to traditional inflammatory markers of the acute phase response. For instance, neopterin, a marker of macrophage activation, also showed trends to be more strongly related to risk of death alone (HR for upper quarter versus lower three quarters, 1.86 (95&#x00025; CI 1.24&#x02013;2.77) versus its association with acute MI (HR 1.35, CI 1.03&#x02013;1.79) in a population with prevalent vascular disease <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Ray1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Aetiological Relevance</title><p>One interpretation of our findings is a possible mechanistic role for inflammation in the promotion of serious vascular disease, which is more likely to lead to death. Inflammation marker levels are associated with risk of death in the acute setting <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Marsik1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Smith1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, and it may be that elevated baseline inflammation increases the risk (or is associated with an increase in risk) that leads to more incident vascular events being fatal. The mechanisms for this observation require further study, but could include chronic low-grade inflammation being associated with a lowered buffering capacity to cope with the stress of a significant vascular insult, a greater likelihood of any vascular insult to be accompanied by a fatal cardiac arrhythmia or more diffuse myocardial necrosis <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Honda1" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>, or indeed a greater clotting potential, or a combination of mechanisms. The search for such mechanisms will be stimulated by our findings. Among the inflammatory markers IL-6 seemed to show more marked associations with fatal CVD than CRP or fibrinogen, although epidemiological studies alone cannot infer causality. The recent availability of IL-6 blocking agents in autoimmune diseases <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Smolen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref> may help promote relevant research in this area and there is increasing need to test whether inflammation blockers lessen vascular risk, or otherwise, in a range of differing populations. Alternatively, inflammatory markers may not be causally related to vascular death; our findings could also be consistent with the hypothesis that elevated levels of inflammatory markers are an indicator of subclinical disease (vascular or otherwise) and lifestyle circumstances that promote death from several causes <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Lowe1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. To this end all inflammatory markers were, as expected, also independently associated with non-CVD mortality.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Clinical Relevance</title><p>CRP as a CVD risk factor is once again in sharp focus post JUPITER trial <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Ridker1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Ridker2" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, but there is continued debate about its inclusion in CVD risk assessment <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Welsh2" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. However, the differential pattern of association of CRP (and IL-6) with fatal versus nonfatal events is not at all considered as a potentially important feature in prior literature, but may need consideration by relevant guideline committees. For example, recently devised SCORE risk charts for European-wide use, devised by a European guidelines committee <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Graham1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, is designed to predict risk of 10-y CVD fatality rather than combined fatal and nonfatal CVD. Thus, the use of CRP or other inflammatory markers in CVD risk assessment, if ever widely adopted, may well be more suited to prediction of fatal CVD events. For instance, Zethelius et al. recently demonstrated significant improved ability of four biomarkers including CRP (others NT-proBNP, cystatin C, and troponin I) to usefully enhance prediction of CVD death beyond traditional risk factors <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Zethelius1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>. However, these authors appeared not to be aware of the possibility that their superior predictive results may have been influenced by their use of only a fatal CVD endpoint. Accordingly, our findings may help improve future research of novel CVD risk factors for clinical use. Of course the exploration of our conclusions, if confirmed, should help also in maintaining future health.</p><p>Our findings may also hold particular relevance to patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a chronic inflammatory condition, recently shown to be linked to a greater likelihood of sudden death compared to non-RA patients <xref rid="pmed.1000099-MaraditKremers1" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, and a greater 30-d case fatality rate following MI <xref rid="pmed.1000099-VanDoornum1" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. Thus, improved understanding of the mechanisms linking inflammation markers to fatal CVD events may ultimately improve clinical management not only in the low grade setting but also in the high grade inflammation arena of auto-immune conditions. In this respect, IL-6 blocking agents are now licensed for clinical use in RA <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Smolen1" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>, and are likely to be used in future large trials to tease out causal pathways and net vascular effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Generalisability of PROSPER</title><p>We examined the dataset for peculiarities that might render our findings atypical, but found no such evidence. First, the baseline associations of inflammatory markers with each other and with other risk factors in this population are broadly in keeping with expectations. Second, the observed adjusted risk associations of IL-6 and CRP with the combined nonfatal and fatal CVD endpoint are broadly consistent with findings from recent important meta-analyses including younger populations <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh2" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Similarly, PROSPER findings on other risk factors (e.g., leptin <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Welsh3" ref-type="bibr">[40]</xref>) or risk criteria (e.g., metabolic syndrome <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Sattar2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>) are also in line with observational studies conducted in younger populations <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Sattar2" ref-type="bibr">[41]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Sattar3" ref-type="bibr">[42]</xref>. Third, our findings for CRP in terms of modest improvement in prediction of the traditionally examined combined fatal and nonfatal CVD endpoint, beyond conventional risk factors, are in line with recent reports from the Cardiovascular Health study group <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Cao1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> and the MONICA Augsburg study <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Koenig1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> where this variable only modestly improved prediction of CVD events beyond that of conventional risk factors. Fourth, all three inflammatory markers, measured independently, showed similar associations. Fifth, our findings for IL-6 and CRP were similar in unadjusted and adjusted analysis and thus unlikely to be biased by adjustment by other CVD risk factors. Sixth, the results were also not influenced by randomized treatment. Finally, the endpoint ascertainments were of high quality given that PROSPER was a clinical trial with adjudication committees with rigorous endpoint criteria.</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Study Limitations</title><p>Although this is a large study with a large number of events, it has insufficient power to further analyse the &#x0201c;fatal other CVD&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;non-CVD mortality&#x0201d; groups by subgroups of events such as MI versus stroke. The study comprised elderly at risk patients (largely secondary prevention), and we cannot exclude the possibility that this group may show more marked differences in the magnitude of association of inflammation markers with fatal versus nonfatal CVD events as compared with studies in middle-aged populations, although, as discussed above, the extent of other data suggests PROSPER findings are generally consistent with those in younger cohorts. Although PROSPER is a high vascular risk population, participants were otherwise clinically healthy, as per trial exclusion criteria (e.g., no diagnosed prevalent cancers at baseline <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Shepherd1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Shepherd2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>). The study only had up to an average of 3.2-y follow-up, although short follow-up may be appropriate in elderly populations. We recognize the study is more relevant to reveal novel associations rather than test prediction but nevertheless, on the basis of our findings others should now retest their risk factor data to check for differential prediction of fatal versus nonfatal events. The study was conducted in the context of a randomized trial of statins <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Shepherd2" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>&#x02014;however, there was no interaction between active and placebo group status for the main analyses in the present report. We did not adjust for regression dilution because of lack of repeat measurement for parameters but note that IL-6 associations with fatal CVD events in particular may be considerably strengthened since this molecule exhibits greater intra-individual variability in its circulating concentrations than does CRP. In this regard, that baseline IL-6 levels demonstrated the greatest differential association between fatal and nonfatal CVD events is remarkable, and of potentially considerable clinical significance. IL-6 is also a more credible causal factor for vascular disease than is CRP. Finally, we recognise that although our findings were consistent for all three inflammatory markers, others will need to replicate our work in prospective cohorts that have all the required endpoints and baseline measurements. In addition, further validation by meta-analysis <xref rid="pmed.1000099-Danesh5" ref-type="bibr">[43]</xref> may soon be possible, whereas Mendelian randomization techniques could be used to examine for potential causal associations <xref rid="pmed.1000099-DaveySmith1" ref-type="bibr">[44]</xref>,<xref rid="pmed.1000099-Lawlor1" ref-type="bibr">[45]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We show that three markers of low grade inflammation (in particular IL-6 and CRP), are more strongly associated with fatal CVD events than nonfatal vascular events.
