They had either not taken anti-diabetic drugs or been on short-term (1 month) treatment that had been stopped for 3 months. None of the patients had a history of unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, liver function impairment, renal function impairment, haematological diseases, chronic hypoxic diseases (emphysema and cor pulmonale), intestinal surgery and infectious disease.</p><p>After 4 weeks run-in phase, patients randomly received metformin hydrochloride (1500 mg/d) or acarbose (300 mg/d), with 24-week monotherapy and 24-week add-on therapy with insulin secretagogues if needed. Bayer Healthcare (China) provided acarbose, and Double Crane Phama provided metformin. According to 2007 Chinese management guideline, add-on therapy with insulin secretagogues was began at 24 weeks when the HbA1c was higher than 7%, or FBG was higher than 7 mmol/L. After 24-weeks monotherapy, five patients in acarbose group and three patients in metformin group received insulin secretagogues.

However, it was still unclear whether the above mentioned therapeutic efficacy was diversified under the pathological condition of obesity. Our present study showed that the reduction of HbA1c levels and the proportion of patients with HbA1c of 6.5% or less were similar in different BMI status after acarbose and metformin treatment. So the glucose-decreasing effect of acarbose was similar to metformin in Chinese patients newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes regardless of patient's weight.

In the present study, Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes had a greater percentage of overweight. Besides, the mean ages of overweight and obese diabetic patients were younger than normal weight patients. As body weight and BMI increased, insulin resistance became more pronounced and the prevalences of hypertension and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease also got higher. The impact on weight is one of important aspects for evaluating the clinical value of hypoglycemic drugs. Our study demonstrated that acarbose and metformin respectively leaded to a significant and modest decrease of body-weight in different BMI status, and greater weight loss corresponded to higher BMI. Interestingly, acarbose showed a slimilar weight-loss effect with metformin. Our results about metformin were consistent with others <xref rid="pone.0105698-Fontbonne1" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105698-Knowler1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. But acarbose only results in slight weight loss of diabetic patients in other previous studies <xref rid="pone.0105698-Hanefeld2" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The difference of weight loss about acarbose may be related to high carbohydrate diet habits and genetic backgrounds of Chinese people. As the &#x003b1;-glucosidase inhibitor, acarbose shows an obvious advantage to Chinese diabetic patients.

Metformin's contribution to weight loss may be explained through the reduction of carbohydrates absorption and ghrelin levels after glucose overload, the induction of a lipolitic and anoretic effect, and the improvement of insulin sensitivity <xref rid="pone.0105698-Glueck1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105698-Mannucci1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Insulin resistance plays a critical mechanism in the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and related complication <xref rid="pone.0105698-Kim1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>. Metformin is widely believed to be a stronger insulin sensitizer than acarbose, especially in obese patients <xref rid="pone.0105698-Rojas1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>. Metformin improves insulin sensitivity indirectly by reducing weight and regulating lipid metabolism, and also directly by stimulating insulin signaling pathway and the expression of insulin receptors and GLUT4 <xref rid="pone.0105698-Salman1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105698-Zhai1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Our present study showed that acarbose and metformin have similar therapeutic efficacy on insulin resistance in overweight and obese diabetic patients. High carbohydrate diet makes Chinese prone to postprandial hyperglycemia, which is the main feature of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. Postprandial hyperglycemia causes insulin resistance by many mechanisms, including enhancing advanced glycation end products and oxidative stress, promoting production of inflammatory factors and disturbing insulin signaling pathway <xref rid="pone.0105698-Azuma1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105698-Zhang1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Thus, acarbose may improve insulin sensitivity by reducing postprandial blood glucose levels <xref rid="pone.0105698-Azuma1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, and the decrease of weight maybe also associated with the insulin sensitizing effect of acarbose. It's worth noting that normal weight diabetic patients presented obvious insulin resistance and metformin significantly ameliorated insulin resistance of normal weight diabetic patients, but acarbose did not present a similar improvement.</p><p>In the aspect of improvement on components of metabolic syndrome, acarbose and metformin also revealed some beneficial effects. Our study was consistent with others <xref rid="pone.0105698-Karamanos1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105698-Monami1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref> and showed that acarbose and metformin treatment causes a slight decline of plasma TC and non-HDL-C in the three BMI groups. Acarbose decreased TG more intensively as compared with metformin in overweight and obesity groups. The proportion of patients with optimal LDL-C levels with metformin treatment was higher than acarbose in obese patients. Acarbose has a beneficial effect on lipid profile through multiple mechanisms, including the reduction of plasma glucose levels, insulin resistance and body weight <xref rid="pone.0105698-Jensen1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. The several clinical trials have shown the blood pressure lowering effects of acarbose and metformin <xref rid="pone.0105698-Rosenbaum1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105698-Uehara1" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. In the present study, acarbose and metformin decreased diastolic blood pressure of obese patients, and had no effect on systolic blood pressure. Insulin resistance may contribute to hypertension by increasing activity of sympathetic, renal sodium retention and vascular smooth muscle tone and proliferation <xref rid="pone.0105698-Verma1" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, so the effect of acarbose and metformin on blood pressure could be related to decreased body weight and insulin resistance. Except through glucose-lowering and insulin resistance-improving, metformin has a direct effect on lipid metabolism by inhibiting mitochondrial complex I and promoting AMPK-dependent catabolic pathways <xref rid="pone.0105698-Zheng1" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0105698-Foretz1" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>. The activation of AMPK inactivates acetyl-CoA carboxylase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA reductase, inhibits the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c (SREBP-1c), which results in a decrease of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis <xref rid="pone.0105698-Kohjima1" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Acarbose and metformin decreased HbA1c levels similarly regardless of BMI status of Chinese patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes. Acarbose and metformin resulted in a significant and modest improvement of anthropometric parametres in different BMI status. Thus, our results provide new clinical evidence to support the idea that acarbose treatment may contribute a similar effect to plasma glucose control compared to metformin in Chinese diabetic patients, even in obesity patients.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The Chinese Diabetes Society was involved in study design and implementation.
