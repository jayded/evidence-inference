More young people spend a majority of their spare time in the digital devices [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130544.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. College students are the vanguard of the first cohort of young people, and sedentary lifestyle becomes prevalent among college students globally [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. A report from American College Health Association indicated that only 43.6% college students reported vigorous physical activity for 20 minutes or moderate activity for 30 minutes on only 3 or fewer days of the previous 7 days [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0130544.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Participation in large amounts of sedentary lifestyle is associated with multiple health problems such as impaired lipid profiles and glucose uptake [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. As a result, college students may be at increased risk for the metabolic syndrome and susceptible to serious chronic diseases later in life [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, mental health problems in college students are increasing steeply due to peer pressure and environmental changes, and becoming a worldwide public health burden [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the United States, mental disorders accounted for nearly half of the disease burden for young adults [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. These mental health problems are associated with poorer academic achievements, instable intimate relationship, even suicide [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, only a small part of college students with mental distress ask for and receive adequate attention [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. It is well established that physical inactivity in young adults are directly linked to mental distress [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Therefore, physical activity may play an important role in the management of mild-to-moderate mental distress [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p><p>Regular physical activities or exercises have been demonstrated to benefit participants&#x02019; physical, mental, and social well-being [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. Recent studies showed that exercise for 8 to 12 weeks was effective for promoting physical fitness and mental health, and improving body composition in college students [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. Baduanjin exercise, translated as the &#x02018;eight section of brocades&#x02019;, is one of many traditional Chinese Qigong exercises for health promotion. It includes eight separate, delicate, and smooth exercise movements, and each movement benefits different physical parts of body or particular organs [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Baduanjin exercise can promote Qi function through the whole exercise of body posture, movement, breathing, and meditation&#x02014;that means using the natural energies to optimize and balance internal energy with the coordination of body, breath, and mind [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Current studies have suggested that Baduanjin training appeared to have substantive benefits for older adults [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A few studies for young adults also indicated that Baduanjin exercise provides potential benefits on reducing depression, stress and anxiety, building self-control and healthy mind, and enhancing physical function [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. However, due to the methodological limitations in previous studies, whether Baduanjin exercise can be recommended as an effective exercise to enhance college students&#x02019; health is still unknown. The purpose of this trial is to systematically evaluate the effect of Baduanjin exercise on physical and psychological outcomes of the college students in China.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Methods and Design</title><sec id="sec008"><title>2.1 Study design</title><p>This was a randomized, single-blind, parallel-controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Baduanjin exercise for the physical and mental health of college students.

The left and right lumbar rotation strength in female participants with Baduanjin exercise had a moderate improvement comparing to female controls at end of additional 12-week follow-up period with a mean improvement of 56.92N and 45.36N versus 44.88N and 34.83N, respectively (<italic>P</italic> = 0.066, and <italic>P</italic> = 0.042) (<xref rid="pone.0130544.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).

However, significant benefits were not observed over the additional 12-week follow-up period, which indicated there was no long-term benefit to practice Baduanjin exercise. No adverse event related to Baduanjin exercise was reported during the intervention period, which suggested this form of exercise is safe.</p><p>As one of the most common forms of traditional Chinese qigong exercises, Baduanjin exercise is not only easy to learn, but also has less cognitive demanding [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. It has been considered as a popular community exercise to promote health in China [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. According to traditional Chinese medicine theory, good health means the unison and balance of the body and spirit. The benefits of regular Baduanjin exercise are expressed through adjusting breathing to make the process of smoother, unifying mind and breathing, strengthening muscles and tendons to make the body more flexible and the unison of mind and body [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In view of sport medicine and traditional Chinese medicine, practitioners should focus on their lumbar function, and it stresses &#x02018;take the waist as the axis&#x02019; when practicing [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. It is therefore expected to enhance participants&#x02019; lumbar muscle strength. In this trial, the increments of lumbar muscle strength in college students for 12 weeks of regular Baduanjin exercise are higher than those with usual exercise, however, the statistical significant difference was not observed between groups. The explanation may be that the college students in control group were already involved in high-intensity sport activities such as basketball, badminton, and ping-pong, etc. However, the enhance on lower limb proprioception function after 12 weeks of Baduanjin exercise in college students was higher than controls.</p><p>Studies in community-dwelling older population indicated that a Baduanjin exercise program could modulate blood lipid metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and sleep quality [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. However, there are few studies focusing on its effect among young adults, especially college students. A previous study with 24 enrolled college students demonstrated an improvement on blood pressure, heart rate, lung capacity, weight, and hand grip strength after 12-week Baduanjin exercise [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The significant changes on vital capacity and heart rate were reported in another study with 200 college students [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. Both studies were not randomized controlled trials, therefore it is difficult to generalize the study findings. In this randomized parallel controlled study comparing with usual exercise, the significant changes of vital capacity, blood pressure, heart rate, and hand grip force between groups were not observed. However, the effect of Baduanjin exercise on cardiorespiratory endurance, flexibility and explosive force of lower limb had obvious improvement over 12-week regular practice.</p><p>Baduanjin exercise can be described as a combination of Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism and traditional Chinese medicine. The key point when practicing is thought to be regulation of the mind. Therefore, it requires practitioner to remove all thoughts and focus on a certain region of the body to feel the flow of Qi through the body [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Through the practice of Baduanjin exercise, one can expect to improve, strengthen, and gain spiritual cultivation. A previous study found that regular Baduanjin exercise with 3 times per week and 60 min per time for 8 weeks had a positive trend to improve self-image and reduce psychologic distress comparing with the inactive controls [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Another study from female university students suggested that Baduanjin exercise could decrease depression, fatigue, anger and tension symptoms measured by SCL-90 scale substantially, and improve self-respect, energy and emotional state after a 6-month intervention [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. In the present trial, self-symptom intensity score in Baduanjin exercise group had a mean reduction of 7.3 points, and a mean reduction of 5.96 points in control group after 12 week exercise, but the difference was not significant between groups. Other psychological outcomes, such as stress, self-efficacy, self-esteem, mood and mindfulness, quality of life, and quality of sleep, were not different between groups either. We thought that the original activities habit practiced by the included participants, such as basketball, badminton, and ping-pong sport, might have a similar effect on psychological outcomes of college students as Baduanjin exercise. However, we did find the attention measured by the Schulte Grid test was improved with a mean shorten 7.5 second in participants over a 12 weeks of regular Baduanjin exercise comparing with controls (<italic>P</italic> = 0.034). This finding may be due to the fact that the exercisers were required to concentrate on adjusting breathing to make unity of mind and breathing when Baduanjin exercise was practicing.</p><sec id="sec024"><title>Study strengths and limitations</title><p>This trial focused on a unique college student population and we used a rigorous randomized, parallel-controlled design with a relatively large sample to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Baduanjin exercise on physical and mental health. We arranged two qualified physical teachers serving as the Baduanjin exercise instructors in order to ensure the standardization of exercise training for participants. Participants in Baduanjin exercise group were gathered to do the exercise at a fixed setting and time. To control confounding factors, all participants were required to record their daily physical activity. Furthermore, the result evaluators and statistical analysts were blinded to ensure the authenticity and objectivity of the trial results. We conducted this trial according to the protocol strictly to control the quality. Therefore the internal validity of the results in this trial was achieved.</p><p>Several limitations occurred in this trial. Ideally, everyone involved in an RCT should be blinded, but this is not always feasible in the non-pharmacological trials [<xref rid="pone.0130544.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Although the participants and exercise instructors are not blinded and the psychological outcome measures are self-report, the assessment of the related physical fitness outcomes, lumbar muscle strength and lower limb proprioception function, and the statistical analyses were performed by research staffs blinded to the treatment allocation. Second, all participants were recruited in one medical university with a greater proportion of female participants, and not controlled intensity, frequency and types of usual activities in two groups, and a relative inadequacy of adherence rate in Baduanjin exercise group. 18 participants had 75% attendance rate or less, and only 40 participants attained more than 85% attendance rate in Baduanjin exercise group. Third, the physical activity was self-report that has inherent limitations such as recall bias or social desirability. In addition, because the effect size between BDJ and Con groups was lower than anticipated, it was possible the study power was overestimated. All of which may affect the efficacy of Baduanjin intervention. Nonetheless, excellent protocol adherence, strictly performance supervision, no significant loss to follow-up and withdrawn, and the use of adjusted analyses strengthen the findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Summary</title><p>In conclusion, this study demonstrates that regular Baduanjin exercise may improve lower limb proprioception function and cardiorespiratory endurance, enhance flexibility, explosive force of lower limb as well as attention in a college student population.
