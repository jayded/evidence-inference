Although the efficacy of OXC appears to mirror that of CBZ <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, OXC has a markedly different metabolic and pharmacokinetic profile that simplifies its use clinically. As opposed to oxidation, OXC undergoes rapid and almost complete reductive metabolism to the active metabolite 10-monohydroxy derivative (MHD; licarbazepine). Because it is the predominant moiety in plasma, MHD is largely responsible for the drug's clinical activity. Oxcarbazepine is converted presystemically to S- and R-licarbazepine enantiomers (80% : 20%) that are virtually indistinguishable in terms of their biological activity <xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>. Reductive metabolism of OXC avoids the generation of reactive epoxides and reduces the potential for interactions with AEDs that induce the cytochrome P450 system. Pharmacokinetics of MHD are linear and dose proportional from 300 to 2400&#x000a0;mg <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. Efficacy as adjunctive therapy is likewise dose related for dosages ranging from 600 to 2400&#x000a0;mg/day <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p><p>In the only placebo-controlled study in adults with immediate-release OXC (OXC-IR) as adjunctive therapy, 67% of patients assigned to 2400&#x000a0;mg/day OXC-IR discontinued due to adverse events <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, demonstrating that poor tolerability may limit the maximum clinically relevant dosage to 1200&#x000a0;mg/day in most patients. As noted in U.S. product labeling for OXC-IR, &#x02018;daily doses above 1200&#x000a0;mg/day show somewhat greater effectiveness in controlled trials, but most patients were not able to tolerate the 2400&#x000a0;mg/day dose, primarily because of CNS effects' <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. The OXC-IR study reported a significant correlation between mean trough MHD concentrations and the incidences of the most common adverse effects, that is, dizziness, diplopia, somnolence, vomiting, nausea. Adverse effects have also been shown to correlate with peak plasma concentrations, particularly MHD concentrations &#x02265;30 &#x003bc;g/ml <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Although these adverse effects may be transient, occurring twice daily within 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;h after dose administration with b.i.d. OXC-IR dosing, they nonetheless can persist throughout the dosing interval <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. Adverse effects with OXC-IR administration, including intermittent events associated with peak plasma MHD concentrations, can often be ameliorated by administering the same total daily OXC-IR dosage more frequently in smaller doses, for example, by switching from b.i.d. to t.i.d. administration <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>. These observations strongly suggest the potential for improved tolerability with an extended-release (ER) OXC formulation that reduces peak plasma MHD concentrations with less frequent dosing.</p><p>SPN-804 (Oxtellar XR&#x02122;, Supernus Pharmaceuticals) is a novel extended-release OXC tablet using a matrix delivery technology to overcome the low, pH-dependent solubility of OXC in aqueous solutions. A dissolving drug-polymer core releases OXC continuously over a 24-hour dosing interval to produce a smoother plasma concentration profile. The MHD concentration peaks 7&#x000a0;h after dosing, is sustained for an extended period, and gradually declines over the remainder of the dosing interval, beginning approximately 12&#x000a0;h after a dose. With once-daily SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg, MHD exposures and peak MHD concentrations are &#x0223c;19% lower and trough MHD concentration is &#x0223c;16% lower than with OXC-IR 600&#x000a0;mg b.i.d <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. The PROSPER study was designed as a placebo-controlled Phase 3 study to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of once-daily SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg and 2400&#x000a0;mg as adjunctive therapy in adults with inadequately controlled partial-onset seizures. Dosages were selected based on a similarly designed Phase 3 dose-ranging study of OXC-IR b.i.d. as adjunctive therapy in adults with refractory partial-onset seizures receiving one to three concomitant AEDs <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>This was a multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT00-772603) conducted between November 2008 and April 2010 at 88 sites in eight countries in North America (United States, <italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>25; Mexico, <italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>13; Canada, <italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>2) and Eastern Europe/Russia (Poland, <italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>18; Russia, <italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>16; Bulgaria, <italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>10; Croatia, <italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>6; Romania, <italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>5). The study was designed with an 8-week prospective observation phase to establish baseline seizure frequency, which was followed by a double-blind treatment period comprised of a 4-week titration phase, 12-week maintenance phase, and 3-week interval for blinded conversion to open-label treatment or tapering to baseline therapy.</p><p>For the double-blind period, patients were randomized 1:1:1 to one of three treatment groups with study drug administered once daily as placebo, SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg, or SPN-804 2400&#x000a0;mg. Randomization was managed by a centralized interactive voice response system, with the vendor using a pseudo-random number generator to produce study drug kit numbers for the randomization schedule. At each visit, study sites accessed the voice response system for instructions on the individual kit number to use. Study drug blinding was maintained with identical 600-mg SPN-804 or placebo tablets and packaging in blister cards. During the double-blind treatment period, patients and all personnel involved with the study's conduct or interpretation remained blinded to study drug codes. Personnel involved in plasma assays for evaluating population pharmacokinetics did not have access to the randomization schedule and were not otherwise involved in the study's conduct.</p><p>Study drug was administered under fasting conditions as four tablets once daily. During titration, the dose was increased weekly in 600-mg increments. Dosages of concomitant AEDs and vagal nerve stimulator (VNS) settings remained constant throughout the study. After week 4, study drug could be down-titrated if needed by discarding the last tablet on each blister pack row, thereby blindly reducing the dose only in the SPN-804 2400-mg group (reduced to 1800&#x000a0;mg/day). After maintaining the target dose for 12&#x000a0;weeks, patients who chose to enroll in the open-label follow-on study were titrated to once-daily SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg in a blinded fashion; all other patients were tapered off study medication before the final study visit. During the 16-week blinded treatment phase for data analysis, study visits were scheduled for days 1 (end of baseline/randomization), 29 (end of titration), 57, 85, and 113 (end of maintenance phase).</p><p>The study was performed in accordance with the International Conference on Harmonization Good Clinical Practice guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki, European Medicines Agency requirements, and the US Code of Federal Regulations. The protocol, amendments, and informed consent were reviewed and approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities in each country and Institutional Review Board or Independent Ethics Committee at each site. Patients provided written informed consent before study participation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients</title><p>Patients aged 18&#x02013;65&#x000a0;years with partial-onset seizures with or without secondary generalization according to the 1981 International League Against Epilepsy Classification of Epileptic Seizures <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> were enrolled. Seizure descriptions for the first three patients screened by each study site were submitted for the Epilepsy Study Consortium review in order to verify seizure classification; review of information for additional patients was required if initial classifications were incorrect. Patients had to have an average of at least three seizures monthly (28&#x000a0;days) during the 8-week screening period despite ongoing treatment with stable doses of one to three AEDs with/without adjunctive VNS. Partial-onset seizures without discognitive features (simple partial) had to have a motor component to be countable (See Appendix S1).</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Efficacy</title><p>Efficacy was assessed using seizure counts from patient-maintained seizure diaries as well as Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) and the Quality of Life in Epilepsy (QOLIE-31) questionnaires. Seizure frequency was calculated as the total number of seizures reported in the seizure diary for the study phase divided by the number of days on which patients recorded data, multiplied by 28. The primary endpoint was the median percent change from baseline in monthly (28-day) seizure frequency for the 16-week treatment period in an intent-to-treat population with analyzable seizure data. Secondary endpoints included responder rate (proportion of patients with &#x02265; 50% seizure frequency reduction), proportion of patients seizure free, and changes in PGIC and QOLIE-31 scores. Data for patients who discontinued early were included in analyses up to their discontinuation, using data recorded through their last visits in the blinded treatment phase.</p></sec><sec><title>Tolerability and safety</title><p>Assessments included monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Affairs (MedDRA), neurologic/physical examinations, clinical laboratory values, vital signs, and ECG tracings.</p></sec><sec><title>Pharmacokinetics and concentration&#x02013;response analysis</title><p>Blood samples were drawn at maintenance phase visits to determine OXC and MHD concentrations for population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with nonlinear mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM). Samples were obtained at separate visits for trough (predose), 1, 2, 4, and 7&#x000a0;h post-dose concentrations. OXC and MHD concentrations were determined with a validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry assay with a quantification limit of 0.005 and 0.05&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml, respectively. Pharmacokinetic variables derived from the population PK analysis included apparent oral clearance (CL/F), maximum (C<sub>max</sub>), and minimum/trough (C<sub>min</sub>) concentrations for OXC and MHD. Data from the population PK analysis were applied to seizure frequency data to evaluate the concentration&#x02013;response relationship in subgroups defined by C<sub>min</sub> plasma MHD concentrations (&#x02265;10 vs &#x0003c;10&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/ml) estimated from population PK analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>Sample size was calculated using the methods proposed by Noether et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> for nonparametric tests (i.e., Wilcoxon rank-sum test), based on the observed differences for placebo vs OXC-IR in a similarly designed study <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Calculations suggested that 120 patients per treatment group would provide over 80% power to detect a difference of 24&#x02013;32% between placebo and once-daily SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg and over 95% power to detect a difference of 31&#x02013;42% between placebo and once-daily SPN-804 2400&#x000a0;mg, each at a two-sided 0.025 level for an overall type 1 error rate of 0.05.</p></sec><sec><title>Analysis sets</title><p>Efficacy was assessed in the intent-to-treat population with analyzable seizure data, that is, all randomized patients with seizure data for &#x02265;21 consecutive days in the baseline phase who received at least one dose of study drug, had at least one on-treatment visit, and &#x02265;14 consecutive days of seizure diary data after study drug receipt. For patients who discontinued early, seizure data through the last visit during the blinded treatment phase were used for determining seizure frequency. The safety population was all randomized patients who had received at least one dose of study drug. Patients assigned to SPN-804 2400&#x000a0;mg who were down-titrated to 1800&#x000a0;mg/day were included in the 2400-mg group for all analyses.</p></sec><sec><title>Primary efficacy analysis</title><p>For seizure frequency analysis, monthly (28-day) seizure frequency was calculated for baseline and 16-week double-blind treatment periods. Median percent seizure frequency change was analyzed with Wilcoxon rank-sum test to test the hypothesis of equal median percent seizure frequency change from baseline between SPN-804 2400&#x000a0;mg and placebo and SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg and placebo. To preserve the overall type I error rate at 0.050, a step-up Hochberg procedure <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> was used for the pairwise comparison of each SPN-804 group against placebo. If both observed <italic>P-</italic>values were &#x0003c;0.050 in favor of SPN-804 treatment groups, then differences for both groups were declared significant. If the observed <italic>P</italic>-value was &#x0003e;0.050 for only one SPN-804 treatment group, then the other SPN-804 was significantly superior to placebo only if <italic>P&#x000a0;</italic>&#x0003c;<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>0.025. The Hodges&#x02013;Lehmann point estimate and associated 95% confidence interval (95% CI) for median treatment differences between placebo and each SPN-804 group were determined. To assess the sensitivity of the primary efficacy results to the effects of dropouts and incomplete seizure diary data, three analyses were conducted: primary efficacy analysis in patients who completed double-blind treatment without premature discontinuation (completer analysis); mixed-model repeated-measures analysis in the overall ITT population; and impact of study site cluster (<italic>post hoc</italic> grouping of study site clusters: North America and Eastern Europe/Russia).</p></sec><sec><title>Secondary efficacy variables</title><p>Responder rates were analyzed using a logistic regression model, with treatment group, country/study site cluster, age, gender, and baseline seizure frequency as explanatory variables. Responder rate effect sizes for SPN-804 vs placebo were estimated with odds ratio and 95% CI. A pragmatic ITT analysis was used for determining seizure-free rates, with the overall ITT population as the denominator. In this analysis, patients were only considered seizure free if they completed double-blind treatment; patients who discontinued early were considered non-responders <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. Fisher's exact test was used for pairwise comparisons of seizure-free rates. Between-group differences in PGIC score changes were compared using Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

However, the effect size in the PROSPER study was actually two- to threefold lower and coincided with an approximately fourfold higher placebo response. Because sample sizes for the PROSPER study were based on effect sizes observed in the previous OXC-IR dose-ranging study <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, the number of randomized patients in the PROSPER study may have been too low to demonstrate a significant effect favoring SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg over placebo in the overall treatment population. In the subset of patients participating at North American study sites, the placebo response was more consistent with that reported by Barcs et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The differences favoring SPN-804 over placebo in median percent seizure reduction were significant for both 1200&#x000a0;mg and 2400&#x000a0;mg and were consistent with the earlier OXC-IR study. The concentration&#x02013;response analysis in the overall population further reinforced the clinical usefulness of once-daily SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg by showing that trough MHD concentrations achieved by most patients (66%) receiving SPN-804 1200&#x000a0;mg were associated with a significant clinical effect.</p><p>The reasons that separate similarly designed trials with the same active drug would have such different placebo responses are unclear. The unexpectedly high placebo effect in the PROSPER study may reflect a &#x02018;placebo drift&#x02019; in AED adjunctive trials that has been especially notable over the last 5&#x000a0;years, with placebo responses increasing and effect sizes decreasing significantly over time <xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>. The phenomenon coincides with the globalization of clinical studies, that is, participation by study sites outside North America and western Europe where AED registration trials have traditionally been conducted. An exaggerated placebo effect in a recent study of perampanel as adjunctive therapy in partial-onset seizures prompted a subset analysis based on regional distribution of study sites in North, Central, and South America <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>. As with the PROSPER study, a treatment effect favoring active drug was only significant in the North American subset, which had a lower placebo response than the overall population. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that regional differences within randomized controlled studies can have important influences on study outcomes. Although verification of seizure classification by the Epilepsy Study Consortium during initial patient screening in the PROSPER study presumably reduced variability of response due to uncertain seizure types, other factors could influence the variability. Pooling data from &#x0223c;360 placebo-treated patients in double-blind trials of lacosamide as adjunctive therapy in patients with refractory partial-onset seizures, Schmidt et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> identified patient factors predictive of lower likelihood of placebo response, that is, history of &#x02265; 7 lifetime AEDs, baseline monthly seizure frequency &#x02265;10 seizures, prior epilepsy surgery (not including VNS placement), age of epilepsy diagnosis at 6&#x02013;20&#x000a0;years of age. Although the relatively small number of patients receiving placebo in the two regional clusters in this study (North America, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;41; Eastern Europe/Russia, <italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;80) precluded meaningful comparisons of patient subsets according to the predictive factors identified by Schmidt et&#x000a0;al., the placebo effects observed in this study, as well as others, point to the need to understand and address sources of variability in placebo response in order to improve AED trial design.</p><p>Extended-release formulations that reduce AED dosing frequency can be more convenient for patients, with the potential for better patient adherence and greater effectiveness. In the interval since seminal studies with AEDs by Cramer et&#x000a0;al. <xref rid="b15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> were published, a large body of evidence has demonstrated that adherence rates with multiple-daily dosing are significantly lower than with once-daily dosing <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>. Several studies have documented associations between adherence/non-adherence and outcomes in patients with epilepsy such as mortality, <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> emergency department/inpatient visits due to serious seizures <xref rid="b20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>, and injuries due to motor vehicle accidents <xref rid="b19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> &#x02013; all of which support an association between adherence and AED effectiveness in controlling seizures.</p><p>However, few blinded randomized studies have directly compared ER AEDs to their IR counterparts, and no blinded randomized study has documented greater effectiveness of a once-daily ER formulation vs its IR formulation solely on the basis of once-daily vs b.i.d administration. Nonetheless, an ER AED formulation has been shown, albeit indirectly, to be more effective than the IR formulation due to improved tolerability associated with &#x02018;flattening&#x02019; the plasma concentration curve from the ER formulation <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>. Two separate but similarly designed blinded randomized trials compared lamotrigine with b.i.d. CBZ-IR <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> or b.i.d. CBZ-ER <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>. Despite identical dosing frequency (b.i.d. administration) in the two studies, therapeutic success measured as patient retention was much greater with CBZ-ER (67% retention) <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> than with CBZ-IR (42% retention) <xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> because CBZ-ER was better tolerated and therefore allowed more patients to derive the benefits of AED therapy.</p><p>The observations with CBZ-ER vs CBZ-IR are especially relevant to SPN-804 and OXC-IR, given the similarities of CBZ and OXC. For both AEDs, which act directly on voltage-gated sodium channels, pharmacodynamic activity mirrors plasma concentration fluctuations, as demonstrated by the appearance of transient side effects when plasma concentrations are at their peak. SPN-804 slows OXC absorption and reduces plasma MHD exposure &#x0223c;16% (C<sub>min</sub>) to &#x0223c;19% (AUC, C<sub>max</sub>) relative to OXC-IR 600&#x000a0;mg b.i.d <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>.</p><p>A crossover PK study of 1200&#x000a0;mg SPN-804 administered once daily vs OXC-IR (Trileptal) 600&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. in healthy volunteers (<italic>n&#x000a0;</italic>=<italic>&#x000a0;</italic>30) initially signaled the potential for improved tolerability with SPN-804. Dizziness was not reported during the SPN-804 period, whereas 11/30 (37%) reported dizziness with b.i.d. OXC-IR exposure (unpublished data). Indirect comparisons across similarly designed studies in patients with refractory epilepsy are also suggestive of the potential for improved tolerability with SPN-804. Namely, in the OXC-IR dose-ranging study <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, 36.2% of patients assigned to OXC-IR 600&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. discontinued due to adverse events; the rate of discontinuations due to adverse events was 14.8% with 1200&#x000a0;mg SPN-804 in the PROSPER study. The most common adverse events with OXC-IR 600&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. &#x02013; dizziness, 32%; diplopia, 30%; somnolence, 28%; vomiting, 25%, nausea, 25%, ataxia, 17% &#x02013; were reported less frequently in patients receiving 1200&#x000a0;mg SPN-804 once daily. Similar differences were observed for OXC-IR and SPN-804 at 2400&#x000a0;mg. It is notable that in the Barcs et&#x000a0;al. study, 26% of patients randomized to 2400&#x000a0;mg OXC-IR completed the study and only 19% completed on the assigned dose <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. Despite &#x0223c;19% reduction in MHD exposure with SPN-804 vs OXC-IR at the same mg total daily dose, SPN-804 was associated with &#x0223c;50% reductions in the frequency of treatment-limiting adverse events. Indirect comparisons across similarly designed studies are fraught with confounding factors that may account for between-study differences. In the case of the PROSPER study and the OXC-IR dose-ranging study, OXC-IR was titrated in half the time as SPN-804, for example, 6 and 14&#x000a0;days to 1200&#x000a0;mg/day, respectively, which would impact tolerability. Study durations were different for the two studies (Barcs et&#x000a0;al., 26&#x000a0;weeks; PROSPER, 16&#x000a0;weeks), which could also influence the results. However, the seizure-free rates in the two studies hint at the potential therapeutic benefit if tolerability and retention can be improved. In the pragmatic ITT analysis of seizure-free rates in the PROSPER study, 11.4% of patients assigned to SPN-804 2400&#x000a0;mg were seizure free for the 16-week double-blind treatment phase; with the higher discontinuation rates in the OXC-IR study (treatment-limiting adverse events: 600&#x000a0;mg b.i.d., 36%; 1200&#x000a0;mg b.i.d., 67%), the pragmatic ITT seizure-free rate was 1.3% <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>. These observations of potential improvements in tolerability and effectiveness associated with the use of SPN-804 as adjunctive therapy in patients with epilepsy must be confirmed, however, in blinded comparative studies.</p><p>As an extended-release formulation that allows once-daily dosing and reduces peak plasma MHD concentrations, SPN-804 (Oxtellar XR) may positively impact treatment effectiveness via its effects on the complex interactions of dosing frequency, tolerability, and patient adherence as well as the ability to achieve higher, potentially more effective dosages. As an extended-release OXC formulation, SPN-804 represents a valuable alternative for patients in whom effectiveness of OXC-IR therapy is compromised by poor tolerability and/or non-adherence. Dosage adjustments may be required in patients who are switched from b.i.d. OXC-IR to once-daily SPN-804 to accommodate differences in plasma MHD concentrations.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Karen Malley, Malley Research Programming Inc, for statistical programming support and also Verna Ilacqua, ID&#x00026;A, for editorial assistance.
