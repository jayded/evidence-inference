Introduction</title><p>Over the last 25 years there have been many studies examining the role of increased dietary fiber intake on satiety and weight loss. A link between fiber and satiety was proposed as early as 1987 [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Since that time there has been a significant amount of research relating fiber to satiety [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Dosages of fiber used have varied considerably, with more consistent satiety effects above 10 g at a single eating occasion. However, mean daily fiber intake for adult women in the U.S. is only slightly above this threshold (about 14 g/day) [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] and well below the recommended 25 g/day [<xref rid="B5-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>It is difficult to incorporate fiber sources into existing breakfast cereal food products without changing desirable food texture and flavor characteristics. Fiber may be added either as part of an ingredient, or as an isolated fiber [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. When fiber is added to food as part of an ingredient such as wheat bran, other components in that ingredient can contribute color, flavor, and texture, as well as additional calories to the finished food. In the case of wheat bran, these components would include starch and protein from the endosperm included in the bran mill fraction. An isolated fiber would contribute significantly fewer calories to the cereal, and less change to food properties.</p><p>Addition of insoluble fibers to a breakfast cereal will increase the amount of water needed to process it, water that ultimately must be removed, adding process complexity and costs. Viscous soluble fibers added to cereals may increase the viscosity of the dough stage, making it harder to process through the unit operations needed to make the cereal (extrusion, mixing, pumping, drying) [<xref rid="B6-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. One approach to reducing the viscosity of soluble fibers is to hydrolyze them into shorter polymers, which then avoids these processing issues.</p><p>Novel concentrated fibers are being created by reducing their molecular weights through enzymatic hydrolysis, or by chemical modifications of existing fibers, to facilitate their addition to food, as well as to minimize effects on the finished product [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Overweight women who are conscious of their body shape and desire to lose weight are seeking food solutions. To help these consumers, the food industry is customizing foods that are lower in calories and higher in fiber content, many containing novel fibers [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Viscous high molecular weight soluble fibers added to beverages have been shown to increase satiety [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Although they have optimized food quality characteristics, it is not certain whether lower molecular weight modified fibers will still have beneficial effects on satiety.</p><p>Two randomized, double-blind, crossover design studies were completed to evaluate the effects of an enzyme-hydrolyzed arabinoxylan from wheat (AXOS) <italic>versus</italic> an intact arabinoxylan from flax (FLAX) added to a ready-to-eat cereal on the postprandial appetitive, hormonal, and/or metabolic responses in overweight women. Subsequent meal energy intake was also assessed.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>2.1. Subjects</title><p>For both trials, subjects were overweight women, 18&#x02013;29 years of age, each with a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0&#x02013;29.9 kg/m<sup>2</sup>, inclusive. Exclusion criteria included recent weight loss of &#x0003e;4.1 kg within 4 weeks of screening visit; history or presence of cancer, renal, hepatic, endocrine (including diabetes mellitus), pulmonary, biliary, gastrointestinal, pancreatic, or neurologic disorders; recent use of any weight loss drugs; weight-reducing surgery or a diagnosed eating disorder; and pregnancy or planning to become pregnant during the study period. Subjects were regular consumers of breakfast cereal and did not dislike macaroni and cheese.</p><p>Subjects were recruited through approved advertisements, flyers, and emails. Before starting the trial, all applicants completed an assessment for inclusion in the study. This included body weight, vital signs, evaluations of inclusion/exclusion criteria, concomitant medication use, a first day of last menses query, as well as medical history, Eating Habits Questionnaire (to exclude unusual eating patterns), in-clinic urine pregnancy test, and Vein Access Scale assessments. Signed written informed consent for participation in the study was obtained from all subjects before protocol-specific procedures were carried out. Subjects were informed of their right to withdraw from the study at any time. These trials were conducted according to Good Clinical Practice Guidelines, the Declaration of Helsinki (2000), and US 21 CFR. The trials were approved by Quorum Review IRB (25787/1 and 26950/1), an appropriately constituted Institutional Review Board, in accordance with the requirements of 21 CFR 56. For trial 1 and 2, 30 and 36 subjects, respectively, were recruited and completed the studies. Five subjects participated in both trials. Women were only tested during the luteal phase of their menstrual cycles (defined as &#x02265;day 15, where day 1 = first day of menses) in order to improve the sensitivity of satiety testing [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Therefore, before starting each treatment visit, subjects again underwent assessments of body weight, vital signs, evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria, concomitant medication use, and a first day of last menses query. For trial 1, treatment visits were a minimum of 7 days apart and for trial 2, visits were a minimum of 4 days apart to enable more treatment visits within the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and because 4 days was considered to be a sufficient period for washout of any carryover from the previous treatment.</p><sec><title>2.1.1. Diets</title><p>Wheat bran is a major component of some high-fiber breakfast cereals, with arabinoxylans being the predominant fiber in wheat bran [<xref rid="B14-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The hydrolyzed fiber included in this study was a wheat bran arabinoxylan extract (AXOS), enzyme hydrolyzed and purified by a proprietary process and obtained from Fugeia N.V. (Belgium). Several treatment steps designed to remove the digestible carbohydrates, cellulose, and proteins from the bran yielded a concentrated wheat arabinoxylan [<xref rid="B8-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] with a degree of polymerization between 3 and 9. The percent fiber in the hydrolyzed AXOS was determined by AOAC method 2009.01 and was 79.6% [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Since an isolated unhydrolyzed wheat bran arabinoxylan was not available in the quantities needed for this work, a flax seed extract composed of arabinoxylans and rhamnogalacturonan was used. The intact fiber (FLAX) was a flax fiber extract obtained from Biogin Biochemicals Co. Ltd. (China). The FLAX was extracted from flax seed mucilage using water and ethanol. The percent fiber in the FLAX was determined by AOAC method 2009.01 and was 81.3% [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>2.1.2. RTEC, Flaked</title><p>RTEC was produced by a proprietary process in the Kellogg Company pilot plant. The main unit operations were cooking under pressure, then cooling and drying the dough, forming pellets, drying and tempering, and finally flaking and toasting. Cooking was done in a batch pressure cooker to heat food to a temperature of 123 &#x000b0;C and 117 kPa pressure to hydrate the grains. The nutrient composition of the cereals is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-07-01245-t001">Table 1</xref> and the formulae are referenced [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].

In trial 2, subjects randomly consumed the LF, HF-AXOS, or HF-FLAX RTECs as in trial 1, but also consumed a LF RTEC that was isocaloric to the HF meals (LF-iso); thus, the LF-iso was only 70 g. In both trials, the milk was diluted with water to standardize the weight consumed (500 g/breakfast meal).</p></sec><sec><title>2.1.3. Cereal Flake Texture and Sensory Measurements</title><p>RTEC (59 mL) was placed in a Kramer shear press and peak force (g) was assessed using TX.XT Plus Texture Analyzer (Stable Micro Systems, Surrey, UK) with 50 kg load cell at a test speed of 2 mm/s. For milk soaked samples, RTE cereal (59 mL) was placed into 52 mL of 2% milk for 7 min. The soaked sample was assessed at a speed of 5 mm/s with a square probe. A trained panel of 8 people also evaluated the three RTEC samples for texture attributes in a sequential monadic fashion both at first bite and after chewing (&#x0003c;15 times). The data were collected by panel consensus [<xref rid="B16-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>2.2. Trial Design</title><p>Trials 1 and 2 were both randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trials. In both trials, subjects fasted 9&#x02013;13 h before the start of RTEC product consumption (<italic>t</italic> = 0 min). Subjects recorded all foods and beverages consumed after 1400 h the day prior to the first treatment visit. These records were collected and reviewed, and subjects were provided a copy of the record and instructed to replicate the same diet from 1400 h the day prior to each subsequent treatment visit. Following the overnight fast, the subjects randomly consumed one of the breakfasts on each testing day between 0630 h and 0930 h. Perceived appetite and satiety were assessed before and after breakfast at specific times throughout the 4.5 h testing day. After the 120 min rating, subjects were allowed 200 mL of water. The amount of water consumed was recorded, and subjects were asked to consume a similar amount of water at subsequent treatment visits.</p><p>In addition to the previous procedures, trial 2 also included blood sample collection. An intravenous catheter was inserted in the forearm for collection of venous blood. To maintain patency of the intravenous catheter, the catheter was flushed with 10 mL normal saline solution hourly. A baseline blood sample to assess active ghrelin (acylated form; <italic>n</italic>-octanoic acid on serine 3), active glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1<sub>7&#x02013;36</sub>), total PYY (PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> + PYY<sub>1&#x02013;36</sub>), glucose, and insulin was drawn at <italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;10 &#x000b1; 5 min.

Ad Libitum Lunch</title><p>A macaroni and cheese lunch (40 oz.) was provided in coded ceramic pots to subjects at 240 min after the breakfast meal (Stouffer&#x02019;s Family Size 40 oz., Nestl&#x000e9; USA Inc., Solon, OH, USA). Subjects ate directly from the pots and were provided with a standard amount of water during lunch. The quantity of water consumed was recorded. Subjects were allowed 25 min for lunch and were instructed to eat until comfortably full. Food was weighed prior to and following consumption, and energy intake was assessed based on nutrition facts panel data (Total Fat 17.0 g, Carbohydrates 30.0 g, Dietary Fiber 2.0 g, Sugars 4.0 g, Protein 15.0 g, 330 kcal/225 g).</p></sec><sec><title>2.4. Appetite Measurements</title><p>Perceived appetite was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The scale was 100 mm in length with descriptions expressing the most positive and most negative ratings for desire to eat, hunger, fullness, and prospective consumption. Subjects placed a mark crossing the line connecting descriptors and the distance in mm from the left side was used as the rating. Perceived appetite was assessed prior to breakfast meal consumption (<italic>t</italic> = &#x02212;15 and &#x02212;5 min). At <italic>t</italic> = 0 min, subjects consumed one of the RTECs between 0700 and 1000 h. Subjects were allowed 15 min to consume the breakfast meal. Subsequent VAS ratings were completed by the subjects at <italic>t</italic> = 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 105, 120, 135, 150, 165, 180, 195, 210, 225, 240, and 270 min. Net incremental area under the curve (niAUC) was calculated using the trapezoid method for 2 h and 4 h.</p></sec><sec><title>2.5. Hormonal Analyses</title><p>Blood was collected in test tubes containing EDTA and protease inhibitors (AEBSF and DPP-IV) to reduce protein degradation. Within 10 min of collection, samples were centrifuged at 4 &#x000b0;C for 10 min. The plasma was separated and stored at &#x02212;80 &#x000b0;C for future analysis. Plasma active ghrelin (acylated form; n-octanoic acid on serine 3), active GLP-1 (GLP-1<sub>7&#x02013;36</sub>), total PYY (PYY<sub>3&#x02013;36</sub> + PYY<sub>1&#x02013;36</sub>), and insulin, were prepared using the Milliplex MAP magnetic bead-based multi-analyte, metabolic panel, 4-plex immunoassay (HMHMAG-34K; Millipore, St. Charles, MO, USA) and measured using Luminex Magpix with xPONENT software (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX, USA).

Discussion</title><p>The effects of increased dietary fiber on appetite control and satiety are inconsistent, potentially due to type of fiber, dosage, and delivery form incorporated in these studies as well as the physicochemical properties of the fibers [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Also, fibers can be modified by hydrolysis to facilitate incorporation into food, making their effects on satiety even more uncertain. It is important to further understand how the physicochemical properties of fiber and fiber modifications influence satiety and energy intake parameters. This study was designed to evaluate the effects of an enzyme-hydrolyzed arabinoxylan from wheat (AXOS) <italic>versus</italic> an intact arabinoxylan from flax (FLAX) added to a RTEC on perceived appetite, on subsequent meal energy intake, and on hormonal responses in overweight women. No differences in perceived appetite and satiety or subsequent meal energy intake were observed between the low-fiber <italic>versus</italic> the high-fiber breakfast meals in both trials. However, the high fiber breakfast meals led to elevated plasma GLP-1 and PYY concentrations compared to the low-fiber versions. This was an acute study design; longer-term studies are needed to further understand these physicochemical properties of fiber on satiety.</p><sec><title>4.1. Perceived Appetite</title><p>There have been numerous studies comparing perceived appetite after consuming RTECs with added fiber. No effect was found in perceived hunger or fullness (AUC) when comparing RTEC with 41 g fiber, 250 kcal, and a 550 g meal size with a low-fiber control cereal (1.5 g fiber) 60 or 120 min after the breakfast meal [<xref rid="B22-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Samra and Anderson [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] provided a RTEC with 33 g fiber and a meal size of 500 g, and found that average appetite scores 75 min later were not statistically different <italic>versus</italic> a low-fiber (1.5 g) RTE cereal. They did observe an increase in fullness with the higher fiber RTEC. Other studies compared RTECs with lower fiber concentrations on perceived appetite [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The majority of these studies indicate that there was no effect of fiber on perceived appetite in this food form. The results from the current study support this conclusion. This is in conflict with many studies where a modest amount of fiber added to beverages increased perceived appetite [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Food form may have an impact on the ability of fiber to increase satiety.</p><p>In a beverage system, as little as 2.5 g fiber has been shown to affect perceived appetite [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Significant hunger reduction (&#x02212;13%) with a psyllium (7.4 g) containing beverage relative to no fiber control was found [<xref rid="B30-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. These studies demonstrated a perceived appetite effect of beverages at much lower added fiber levels than we used in RTECs. One possible explanation is that fibers need to be hydrated before their viscous properties can be fully realized, and this is more likely to occur in a beverage food form than a solid one, or than in a meal with liquid added to a solid form, like milk added to RTEC. In the current study ~80% of the meal mass was liquid (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-07-01245-t001">Table 1</xref>); however, the physical form of the RTE flake may have attenuated the fiber&#x02019;s ability to affect perceived appetite.</p><p>Viscosity of the fiber is believed to be responsible for some of the satiety effects of beverages [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B29-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="B31-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Kristensen and Jensen [<xref rid="B32-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] reviewed nine published studies on the effect of fiber and viscosity on satiety of beverages. They found that in most cases increased viscosity led to increased satiety with fiber levels tested ranging from 3 to 10 g. Many of these beverage studies used very viscous fibers like alginates and gums that have a very high molecular weight and impact viscosity at a low concentration. The FLAX ingredient we used to produce the high-fiber RTEC had a high molecular weight and a very high viscosity [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We anticipated that it would produce a higher viscosity RTEC; however, we found that processing reduced the FLAX fiber molecular weight and viscosity of the cereal. The most viscous cereal at the time of consumption was the LF RTEC (from the higher available gelatinized starch present); however, that viscosity might quickly be reduced by digestive amylases in the intestine. Most RTEC studies used a low-fiber, corn flake control RTEC that had a relatively high level of gelatinized starch. Although viscosity of cereal is seldom reported, high-fiber RTECs may not be more viscous than low-fiber, high-starch control RTECs. This may contribute to the reported inconsistency of high-fiber cereals to enhance satiety.</p></sec><sec><title>4.2. Lunch Meal Energy Intake</title><p>The overweight female subjects in the current study were offered the <italic>ad libitum</italic> lunch meal 4 h after the breakfast meals because this represented a typical time interval between breakfast and lunch meals for most adults. In the current study, subjects consumed a similar amount of calories at lunch regardless of breakfast calories consumed. By 4 h, the effects of the breakfast cereals at the lunch meal may have been diminished, since perceived appetite scores were almost at baseline. In addition, both clinical trials studied overweight female subjects, who may be less responsive to appetite cues [<xref rid="B33-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Other investigators also found similar energy intake at lunch offered between 3 and 3.5 h after subjects consumed RTEC with high fiber content [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, unlike these studies, some investigators using RTEC did observe a reduction in second meal energy intake when they employed a shorter time interval between breakfast and lunch [<xref rid="B23-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="B27-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="B34-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. This may explain why they observed a lower energy intake in the second meal.</p><p>While we cannot rule out the possibility that the high palatability of the macaroni and cheese lunch meal could also have been a factor biasing toward high energy intake and failure to show a difference between conditions in energy intake despite differences in appetite-related hormones (discussed below), it seems unlikely to have been a material issue influencing the results, given that both VAS and energy intake results were concordant in both trials. It is also possible that the subjects stopped eating due to sensory-specific satiety given they were able to consume only one type of food, contributing to the discrepancy between the hormone and the food intake data [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>4.3. GLP-1 and PYY</title><p>Plasma GLP-1 and PYY concentrations were significantly higher with the high-fiber breakfasts than with an equal calorie low-fiber control RTEC. Secretion of GLP-1 and PYY has been shown to be co-located within the enteroendocrine L cells located predominately in the distal small intestine and colon [<xref rid="B36-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], and carbohydrates and protein are strong stimulants of these hormones within this segment of the intestinal tract [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B40-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The high fiber content of the HF-AXOS and HF-FLAX RTECs may have caused carbohydrate and protein residues to reach the distal small intestine within the first hour after consumption [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B42-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Digestion and absorption of carbohydrate and protein in the distal small intestine would then contribute to greater observed elevation of GLP-1 and PYY when the high-fiber RTECs were consumed than when the low-fiber RTECs were consumed.</p><p>In the later portion of the interval between breakfast and lunch consumption, it is likely that short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) were produced from the fermentation of the HF-AXOS and HF-FLAX high-fiber containing RTECs, and that the SCFA stimulated L cells in the distal small intestine and colon to cause GLP-1 and PYY secretion [<xref rid="B43-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="B44-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].

We did observe a lower plasma active ghrelin concentration at the 2 and 3 h time points with the high-energy control RTEC <italic>versus</italic> the low-energy control RTEC, suggesting the greater available calories in the high-energy RTEC might have delayed the return to baseline concentrations in ghrelin. The ghrelin difference observed was relatively small, and may not have been sufficient to elicit a perceived appetite change nor a change in lunch meal energy intake. These lower ghrelin concentrations with the high-energy control RTEC at 2 h and 3 h also corresponded to a higher concentration of insulin at the same time points. Blom <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref rid="B49-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] demonstrated a significant negative correlation between plasma ghrelin and insulin concentrations between 30 and 180 min and concluded that insulin may contribute to ghrelin suppression.</p><p>Viscous fiber consumption has been shown to attenuate plasma glucose and insulin concentrations [<xref rid="B50-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="B51-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. The steam pressure-cooking used to make the RTEC reduced the FLAX fiber molecular weight and viscosity of the cereal such that cereals containing FLAX and AXOS each had a relatively low viscosity [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-07-01245" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This reduced the FLAX fiber&#x02019;s ability to attenuate plasma glucose and insulin concentrations.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>No differences in perceived appetite, satiety, or lunch intake were observed with 15 g of added AXOS or FLAX fiber in a RTEC breakfast when consumed by overweight women. Collectively, these data suggest that 15 g of low molecular weight fiber added to RTEC did not affect perceived appetite, satiety, or energy intake at lunch 4 h after breakfast despite differences in satiety hormone signaling in overweight females.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the Kellogg Company, to enable partial fulfillment of the Ph.D. degree requirements for the first author.</p><p>We thank Gary Day and Guoshen Yang for their help preparing RTEC, Toine Hulshof for advice on the study design, Valerie Kaden for her assistance managing the trials, and Arianne Schild, Kernon Gibes, and Tony Gualtieri for statistics support.</p></ack><notes><title>Author Contributions</title><p>David W.
