MDA increased from 6.22&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.8 (placebo) to 8.48&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.2 (A) and 8.02&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.8&#x000a0;nmol/gHb (B). NO concentrations were enhanced from 19.3&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;4.2 (P) to 23.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;6.4 (A) and 24.1&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;5.4&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/L (B). GSH contents were decreased from 10.42&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.81 (P) to 8.02&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;2.92 (A) and 9.39&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;1.02&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/g Hb (B), whereas GSSG concentrations increased from 0.98&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.28 (P) to 1.24&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.29 (A) and 1.08&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;0.12&#x000a0;&#x000b5;mol/g Hb (B). SOD activity decreased 23% in A and 14% in B; GRx decreased 27% in A and 5.5% in B; GPx decreased 12% in A and 9.6% in B. Catalase activity, however, increased 27% in A and 29% in B as compared to control. Thus, we conclude that the use of vitamins C and E should be considered for the control of certain important biochemical indices during the development of preeclampsia; however, further studies are needed to develop methods for the prevention of preeclampsia in women at high risk.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>vitamin C &#x00026; E</kwd><kwd>antioxidants &#x00026; pro-oxidants</kwd><kwd>enzymatic &#x00026; non-enzymatic</kwd><kwd>preeclampsia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Preeclampsia is a disorder of pregnancy characterized by pregnancy-induced hypertension (&#x02265;140&#x000a0;mmHg systolic and/or &#x02265;90&#x000a0;mmHg diastolic blood pressure), new-onset proteinuria (&#x02265;300&#x000a0;mg protein/day), and edema occurring in the second half of pregnancy. A significant reduction in the incidence of preeclampsia was found in women at risk who were taking vitamins C and E supplements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Antioxidant supplements in these women were also shown to be associated with changes in indices of oxidative stress and placental functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. The vitamin C content in both mild and severe preeclamptics was found to decrease significantly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>] in association with enhanced peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] and lowered thiol levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The reason for the decrease in plasma ascorbate is not very clear, but it is consistent with the hypothesis that uteroplacental perfusion induces oxidative stress and ascorbate consumption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. The functional consequence and the possible role of the decrease in plasma vitamin C reserves in preeclampsia (PE) are consistent with the fact that women who ingested less vitamin C than the recommended daily allowance (8.5&#x000a0;mg) were at a 2-fold increased risk of developing PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. Currently, there are several large multicenter trials in progress to determine the efficacy of antioxidant therapy in the prevention of preeclampsia. Some negative results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>] have appeared but more results are awaited finally with interest and will determine whether antioxidants are effective in preventing preeclampsia in all populations, or whether such therapy will be population specific. However, in a recent review, antioxidant therapy has been suggested and that the prophylactic supplementation of vitamins C and E to pregnant women is associated with reduced incidence of preeclampsia and decreased placental and endothelial dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>].</p><p>In preeclampsia, an inverse correlation between vitamin E levels and lipid peroxidation has been found [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] suggesting that vitamin E content in plasma may be used as a prognostic marker of the likely development of preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. In addition, there was a relationship found between the extent of vitamin E deficiency and increased lipid peroxidation with enhanced diastolic blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Thus, decreased plasma levels of vitamin E could be a contributory factor of hypertension in preeclampsia, but other studies have not demonstrated significant differences in plasma vitamin E levels between normal and preeclamptic women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. Moreover, some results are at variance with the prevailing opinion, since increased plasma levels of vitamin E among women with preeclampsia as compared to those in normotensive pregnant women have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. The latter study does not support the hypothesis of a causal relationship between decreased dietary vitamin E consumption and plasma levels and the development of preeclampsia. Thus, there is not a consensus whether or not these antioxidant vitamins exert a positive effect to control preeclamptic developments, especially as they pertain to oxidative stress, this area needs further study.</p><p>During pregnancy, nitric oxide (NO) is one of the most important relaxing factors of myometrium and also no less important in the control of blood flow in uterus and placenta. Oxidative stress developed in preeclampsia may cause endothelial dysfunction, which may lead to hypertension by decreased release of vasodilating agents such as NO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. NO is a potent vasodilator, and its altered production by the vascular endothelium may influence the pathogenesis of preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. NO regulates leukocyte adhesion to the endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and inhibits vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and platelet aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>].</p><p>All these functions could be impaired by the consumption of NO by superoxide anions produced during oxidative stress, thereby diminishing NO bioavailability. Consistent with this are the findings of a diminished level of NO in plasma of preeclamptic women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. The status of plasma NO in preeclampsia is, however, still controversial, and different groups have reported an increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>], a decrease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] or no change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] in NOx levels (nitrites and nitrates, products of stable degradation of NO). A pathogenic link between serum uric acid is evident from several studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] although it has dual roles. It may have beneficial functions [acting as an antioxidant] as well as detrimental actions [to stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and induce endothelial dysfunction] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>].<italic/>Thus, our present study also aimed to evaluate NO and uric acid contents in the plasma of control and preeclamptics with and without vitamin supplements.</p><p>There is no satisfactory treatment of this disease, except steps to avoid or reduce complications such as hypertension and eclamptic seizures and early delivery is the only successful treatment. It is hypothesized that preeclamptic condition could be explained by alterations in the function of vascular endothelium and placenta, likely in response to reduced perfusion, produces circulating factor(s) that alters endothelial function. These factor(s) are products of oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] and placenta may be the site of the lipid peroxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The maternal circulating components were found to regulate oxidative status of glutathione redox cycle and adhesion molecule expression in endothelial cells (ECs). Reduced cellular glutathione, and glutathione reductase (GRx) activity and altered glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity accompany increased inflammatory reactions in ECs responding to circulatory toxic factors in preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. Various studies have highlighted the asymmetric alterations in the activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, GRx and GPx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>].</p><p>In view of the contradictory reports and the seriousness of preeclampsia, the present study included the determination of the activities of catalase, SOD, GPx and GRx in the blood of normal and preeclamptic women with and without vitamin treatment, along-with the contents of MDA, GSH, GSSG, GSSG/GSH, NO and uric acid, to collectively evaluate the roles of vitamins C and E in the regulation of these factors.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec><title>Chemicals</title><p>ATP, NADPH, GSH, GSSG, Aspergillus nitrate reductase, and GRx, EDTA, TBA and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were obtained from Sigma Chemical Company (St. Louis, MO.).

The patients in our study included pregnant women with normal blood pressure, preeclamptic women admitted to our hospital who had been or not under regular care, and also those who were referred from private sectors or primary health centers. The control group (placebo) consisted of 20 normotensive pregnant women who were taking regular prenatal vitamins from the second trimester of pregnancy to delivery.</p><p>Group A comprised 22 patients who were not taking any vitamin supplements, as they belonged to rural areas with incomes below the poverty-line; they were not booked cases and they arrived with full term pregnancies just a few days before delivery. Group B initially consisted of a high number of patients who were viewed as being at an increased risk of preeclampsia because of factors such as preeclampsia in a preceding pregnancy, HELLP syndrome, or eclampsia in any past pregnancy at any gestational stage, and who were taking additional vitamin supplement (1000&#x000a0;mg vitamin C plus 400&#x000a0;IU vitamin E per day) from the second trimester of pregnancy to delivery as mentioned for the controls (placebo). At a later stage, however, some of the women in this group did not appear at the time of full term delivery.

Peroxynitrite is a potentially harmful ROS as it causes nitrosylation of tyrosine residues, leading to changes in protein conformation and inactivation. Preeclampsia is associated with increased nitrotyrosine residues in placental villous vascular endothelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. The effect of elevation in peroxynitrite and reduced bioavailability of NO, resulting from enhanced production of free radicals and the resultant placental oxidative state, may contribute to the elevation of maternal blood pressure, proteinuria, platelet dysfunction and alteration in the level of thromboxane, prostacyclin and endothelin characteristic of preeclampsia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Another common source of placental oxidative damage is the peroxidation of membrane phospholipids that exerts a variety of effects within placenta. Our results on NO contents showed an increase of about 23&#x02013;25% in preeclamptics, but the bioavailability of NO might have been blocked, as there was an increase of 29&#x02013;36% in MDA contents.</p><p>The oxidative destruction of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) of phospholipids, known as lipid peroxidation, can be in fact considered as a hallmark of oxidative stress. PUFAs are important for the normal function of most of the cells. MDA, an end product of lipid peroxidation induced by ROS, is well correlated with the degree of lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]. The result mentioned above revealed a highly significant increase in MDA content in preeclamptic patients in comparison to normal placebo. This may result in a greater potential for endothelial damage ultimately leading to elevated diastolic pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Enhanced ROS in turn can oxidize many other important biomolecules including erythrocyte membrane phospholipids. Thus, lipid peroxides and free radicals may be important in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia. Our results on MDA contents were consistent with the observations of other workers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] as well. The increase in MDA content in patients who took vitamin (group B) was simply significant (29%) when compared to group A in which it was very significant (36%). This shows the effectiveness of vitamins C and E in restricting the elevation of lipid peroxidation. Our results on NO contents were in agreement with the findings of other investigators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Although levels of NO in preeclamptics, both without and with vitamin had increased significantly and highly significantly, respectively, there was no distinct improvement in blood pressure symptoms for either group. This shows that bioavailability of NO was restricted, perhaps due to its enhanced reaction with superoxide resulting in peroxynitrite (ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup>) as mentioned above.</p><p>The pathogenic link of serum uric acid is evident from other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] and our results are consistent with their reports as the increase in uric acid contents in both groups A and B were found to be extremely significant.</p></sec><sec><title>GSH, GSSG, GSSG/GSH ratio</title><p>Glutathione and glutathione related enzymes are one of the major antioxidant systems within body. GSH is the most abundant thiol-based antioxidant, and is found primarily in the reduced form, with intracellular concentration up to 11&#x000a0;mM and provides sulfhydryl-buffering capacity. It also conveys an antioxidant power through the direct inactivation of ROS or by acting as an electron donor for GPx that reduces H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. It has been suggested that the high levels of GSH may act as a compensatory mechanism in preeclampsia to prevent excessive lipid peroxidation via membrane bound GPx [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. In our study the erythrocyte GSSG concentration was very significantly elevated in preeclamptics, and we observed a significant increase in the redox potential values for the pair GSSG/GSH as compared to placebo, showing altered antioxidant balance. Our data clearly indicate that GSH in red blood cells decreased profoundly in preeclamptic pathophysiological conditions with a parallel increase in MDA and GSSG concentration. Our findings on MDA, GSH and GSSG are in agreement with those reported earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>SOD, GPx, catalase and GRx</title><p>SOD, catalase and GPx are important factors in the antioxidative defense system. SOD protects and revitalizes cells and reduces the rate of cell destruction. It neutralizes some of the most dangerous free radicals, the superoxide radicals, before they can wreak havoc on the body. Superoxide generation also perpetuates oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation through the oxidation of mitochondrial iron-sulphur clusters such as aconitase, which subsequently stimulate membrane phospholipid peroxidation by alkoxyl radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>]. Deficient SOD activity may also increase oxidative insult by promoting the interaction of NO and superoxide to produce peroxynitrite as mentioned earlier. Superoxide dismutase and nitric oxide compete for superoxide. A consequence of SOD deficiency is an increase in nitric oxide interactions with superoxide, which results in the generation of peroxynitrite, subsequently reducing vasodilation through the impairment of NO and increasing ONOO<sup>&#x02212;</sup> induced lipid peroxidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Our results on SOD activity clearly indicate an extremely significant decline (23%) in its activity in preeclamptic patients (Group A) and a significant decrease (14%) in preeclamptics using vitamin (Group B); a significant difference was observed between these two Groups (10&#x02013;11%). From our results we infer the positive effect of vitamins C and E on retaining SOD activity during preeclampsia.</p><p>The principal function of GPx is to protect against damage from the endogenously produced hydroxyperoxides and to catalyze the reduction of hydroxyperoxides by glutathione. Catalase promotes the conversion of hydrogen peroxide, a powerful and potentially harmful oxidizing agent, to water and molecular oxygen. It also uses H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to oxidize toxins such as phenols, formic acid, formaldehyde and alcohols. Catalase, along-with SOD and GPx, controls the levels of oxygen-derived free radicals in cells. Our results show non-significant alterations in GPx activities. The activity of catalase increased very significantly in both Groups A and B (27% and 29% increase respectively), which shows its compensatory regulation in response to increased oxidative stress. No effect of vitamins C and E, however, was observed on GPx levels. GRx activity declined significantly (27%) in preeclamptics who had not consumed vitamins C and E (Group A), but its activity did not fall significantly (5.5%) in patients who had used these vitamins regularly as mentioned above. A comparison of these two Groups revealed a significant difference (22&#x02013;29%), which shows that vitamins C and E consumption prevented the fall in GRx activity. This finding shows a clear correlation with the levels of GSH, which is evident from our results on GSH, GSSG and GSSG/GSH.</p><p>In conclusion, we hypothesize enhanced oxidative stress in preeclampsia, on the basis of our results showing decreased SOD, GRx and GPx activities, with resulting inefficient control of the higher levels of oxygen free radicals produced. The increased activity of catalase that we observed may be a compensatory regulation in response to increased oxidative stress. Increased catalase activity could be interpreted as a futile effort to counteract the overproduction of reactive oxygen species, and to provide a relief to enhanced oxidative damage in preeclampsia. Lipid peroxides could participate in the cytotoxic mechanism leading to endothelial injury and enhanced blood pressure. The decreased concentration of glutathione supports the hypothesis that lipid peroxidation is an important factor in the pathogenesis of PE. Chappell <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] have reported that a significant reduction in the incidence of preeclampsia was found in women at risk who were taking a vitamins C and E supplements. They inferred a correlation between the PAI-1/PAI-2 (plasminogen activator inhibitor) ratio with vitamins C and E levels. Furthermore, they [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>] suggested that antioxidant supplementation in women who were at risk of preeclampsia was associated with improvement in biochemical indices of the disease. Zhang <italic>et al.</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] have reported a 2-fold increased risk of developing preeclampsia in women taking lower vitamin C doses. Several reports reviewed by Rodrigo <italic>et al. </italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>] suggest the prophylactic use of vitamins C and E before the 20<sup>th</sup>. week of gestation, after identifying the risk factors on the basis of history of the patient, what would lower the risk of maternal vascular dysfunction and therein the onset of PE.</p><p>We found that the patients supplemented with vitamin C 1000&#x000a0;mg plus vitamin E 400&#x000a0;IU daily from the second trimester of pregnancy until delivery showed improvements in certain biochemical indices during the development of preeclampsia. The elevation in MDA content was found to be significantly lower. Oxidation of reduced glutathione to GSSG was inhibited to a greater extent. The activities of antioxidant enzymes were also influenced by the use of vitamins C and E. The reduction of SOD activity during the development of preeclampsia was controlled as a consequence of vitamin consumption: the decrease was found to be 14% whereas it was 23% in patients who had not used vitamins C and E. The most prominent effect of the use of these vitamins was found to be associated with the activity of glutathione reductase. Reduction in its activity was much higher 27% as compared to that in patients who were taking vitamins (5.5%). Thus, we conclude that use of vitamins C and E definitely controls certain important biochemical indices during the development of preeclampsia, and that further studies are needed to develop strategies for the prevention of preeclampsia in women at high risk.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We are highly grateful to those patients of our hospital who volunteered to donate their blood when needed for this project.
