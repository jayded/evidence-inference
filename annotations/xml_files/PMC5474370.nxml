</p><p>The hypotheses of the present study were as follows: NIV-related variables (ventilatory mode and pressure settings) have an effect on local skin microcirculation in the zones of contact between the skin and the mask, changing the temperature levels of the facial skin tissue in these zones; and these possible temperature changes in the contact areas are measurable by infrared thermography and can be related to acute adverse effects.</p><p>The objective of the present study was to compare the incidence and intensity of acute adverse effects and the variation in facial skin temperature between NIV modes-continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) vs. bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)-and to analyze the relationship between acute adverse effects of the application of NIV via oronasal mask and the variations in facial skin temperature in two areas: the zones of contact between the face and the mask; and the nasal dorsum.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>METHODS</title><p>This was a prospective, analytical intervention study in humans. It was carried out in the Respiratory Laboratory of the <italic>Universidade Federal do Cear&#x000e1;</italic> (UFC, Federal University of Cear&#x000e1;) between March of 2014 and December of 2015. The sample consisted of 20 individuals (18-45 years of age) who were selected by convenience from among the participants in the Respiratory Laboratory and the student body of the UFC campus and who agreed to participate in the study. There were no dropouts or exclusions. All individuals participated in ventilatory mode randomization. The exclusion criteria were as follows: being under dermatological treatment for skin lesions or making use of creams or any type of chemical substance on the face; being on corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory drugs, or antihistamines; having an axillary temperature outside the normal range (36.5&#x000b0;C-36.8&#x000b0;C); having excessive sun exposure, which was previously defined by the researchers as direct, unprotected sun exposure for more than 30 min before starting the experiment; and having a neurological disease, diabetes mellitus, nutritional disorders, or dehydration. The study was submitted to and approved by the UFC Research Ethics Committee (CAAE 20060113.4.0000.5045).</p><sec><title> Study protocol </title><p>All participants were assessed by the same dermatologist of the UFC Department of Clinical Medicine, who used a specific, dermatological assessment form to check skin integrity and determine skin type and subsequently performed the first thermographic measurement.</p><p>Randomization was performed as follows: 20 labels reading either BiPAP or CPAP were placed into an opaque container; and the participants themselves drew a label out of the container.</p><p>After this randomization, the ventilator was set up-CPAP = 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O or BiPAP; expiratory positive airway pressure (EPAP) = 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O; inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) = 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O; and pressure support = 15 cmH<sub>2</sub>O-and the choice of interface to minimize air leak was made on the basis of the anatomical characteristics of the volunteer's face. The Mirage Quattro FX mask (ResMed, Bella Vista, Australia), which is an oronasal interface equipped with an exhalation valve, was the model made available to the participants.</p><p>Subsequently, the mask was gently placed on the participant's face and was connected to the NIV ventilator; the entire system was checked for the presence of leaks, and the necessary corrections were made.</p><p>We used two dedicated, single-limb NIV ventilators that can be set in CPAP mode and BiPAP mode, both equipped with a memory card to record data during therapy, without a humidifier. The Auto VPAP (ResMed) was set in BiPAP mode, with an EPAP of 5 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and an IPAP of 20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O ; the Autoset II (ResMed) was set in CPAP mode, with a fixed pressure of 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">

</p><p>The individual remained seated for an initial 10-min period of adaptation to NIV, which was then continued for an additional 50 min, totaling 60 min of NIV.</p><p>Immediately after removal of the mask, the second thermographic measurement was performed, and, to prevent any kind of influence by the team, the participants then viewed their own faces in a high-definition digital photographic image in order to complete a questionnaire about NIV-related adverse effects, with a score ranging from zero (no problem) to three (intense problem).<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>18</sup>
</xref> The adverse effects were grouped into three categories: skin lesions; pain; and other adverse effects (Appendix 1; available in the online version of the JBP; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.jornaldepneumologia.com.br/detalhe_anexo.asp?id=49">http://www.jornaldepneumologia.com.br/detalhe_anexo.asp?id=49</ext-link>). Subsequently, thermographic images were taken at 5, 15, and 30 min after removal of the mask, with the participants in the same posture and under the same conditions as those of the previous measurements.</p><p>The memory cards of the ventilators were read with ResScan software (ResMed) in order to record leaks occurring around the mask.</p><p>The thermographic images taken with a VarioCAM thermographic camera (InfraTec, Jena, Germany) were stored in the memory card of the camera and analyzed with IRBIS<sup>(r)</sup> Professional analysis software for thermographic images, version 2.2 (InfraTec). The thermographic images were converted and transferred to MATLAB<sup>(r)</sup> simulation software, version 2015a (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA). On the basis of a reference point established by a piece of styrofoam glued between the participant's eyebrows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figure 1</xref>A), the regions of interest in the original images were cut out in the shape of a trapezoid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1">Figures 1</xref>B and 1C). By means of a specific script, a color-based comparative analysis of the temperature variation in the zones of contact between the skin and the mask was carried out by superimposing the images taken at each of the time points after removal of the mask on those taken at baseline. The room where the protocols were performed was kept well lit at a temperature of 22&#x000b0;C (range, 21.5&#x000b0;C-22.5&#x000b0;C) and at a relative humidity of 60% (range, 57.94%-60.26%). The variation in room temperature did not exceed 1&#x000b0;C over the 20-min period.</p><p>

In addition, Pearson's correlation coefficient between skin temperature and adverse effects was analyzed. The level of statistical significance required to reject the null hypothesis was set at 5% (p &#x0003c; 0.05).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>

</p><p>When comparing the participants' answers regarding the intensity of each adverse effect individually, by ventilatory mode, we found no significant differences; however (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>A), when grouping the participants' answers to all categories of adverse effects, we found a significant difference in occurrence of the more intense adverse effects in BiPAP mode. We significantly found that moderate and intense adverse effects (scores 2 and 3) were more common immediately after removal of the mask in the group of participants in whom there was no reduction in the temperature of the nasal dorsum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2">Figure 2</xref>B). There was a statistically significant decrease in the mean temperature of the nasal dorsum, as compared with baseline, immediately, at 5 min, at 15 min, and at 30 min after removal of the mask. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3">Figure 3</xref>A depicts the mean temperature in the areas of contact between the face and the mask and between the nasal dorsum and the mask before and immediately after 60 min of NIV, as well as at 5, 15, and 30 min after removal of the mask. We observed a significantly different behavior between the two areas. In the area of contact between the face and the mask immediately after removal of the mask, there was a decrease in temperature; however, at the subsequent time points (at 5, 15, and 30 min after removal of the mask), there was a trend toward a return to baseline values.

Thermographic analysis of the oronasal region showed cooling in the area of contact between the facial skin and the mask and in the area of the nasal dorsum immediately after removal of the mask. The area of the nasal dorsum varied less relative to the baseline temperature, showing less cooling than the zone of contact between the facial skin and the mask. In the area of contact between the facial skin and the mask, the temperature gradually returned to its baseline value, that is, it increased at the subsequent time points. Visual analysis of the zones of cooling and heating on the face over time showed coexisting areas of hypoperfusion or reactive hyperemia from acute use of NIV after removal of the mask, with a trend toward an increase in temperature in the group receiving BiPAP.</p><p>The more intense acute adverse effects assessed immediately after removal of the mask occurred among the participants in whom the nasal dorsum skin showed less cooling.</p><p>The present study is the first to use thermographic analysis of the facial skin before and after the use of NIV at various time points and to test the association of these findings, for BiPAP and CPAP, with acute adverse effects. The facial skin temperature data of the present study are consistent with those obtained by Haddad et al<italic>.</italic> ,<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">

</xref> studied three types of masks and the acute adverse effects related to their use by comparing two different NIV pressure settings in healthy individuals: a lower pressure setting (IPAP = 11 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and EPAP = 6 cmH<sub>2</sub>O); and a higher pressure setting (IPAP = 15 cmH<sub>2</sub>O and EPAP = 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O). The increase in pressure increased the incidence of acute adverse effects for the three masks. It is possible to infer that, in the present study, BiPAP was associated with a higher incidence and intensity of acute adverse effects, as compared with CPAP, probably because of higher levels of IPAP (20 cmH<sub>2</sub>O vs. 10 cmH<sub>2</sub>O).</p><p>Although microcirculation in the area of contact between the mask and the skin was not subjected to direct measurement, it may have been compromised by decreased blood supply (immediately after removal of the mask), which would result in cooling of the contact area, probably caused by pressure ischemia; subsequently, the temperature returned to its baseline values or even surpassed them, resulting in heating of the area, presumably because of reactive hyperemia. In the area of the nasal dorsum, initially there was a smaller decrease in mean temperature relative to the baseline temperature. On average, there was no return to the baseline values (before NIV); however, in some individuals, heating occurred in this area, demonstrating that the response to the application of NIV is quite individual and varied.</p><p>The phenomenon of reactive hyperemia would explain the findings of the present study, or the poor vascularization of the cutaneous territory of the nasal dorsum would be a reason for the smaller impact of the mask pressure on the temperature variation in this area. Visual analysis of the zones of cooling and heating on the face over time showed that the response to the application of NIV is quite individual and varied.</p><p>Capillary perfusion pressure plays an important role in skin tissue integrity. The pressures leading to capillary collapse usually range from 12 to 32 mmHg or from 20 to 40 cmH<sub>2</sub>O. Direct application of a higher pressure than capillary closing pressure on the skin and soft tissues will cause hypoxia in the area, culminating in tissue ischemia and anoxia.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>20</sup>
</xref> By removing pressure after a short period of time, blood flow is restored through reactive hyperemia. If there is prolonged, persistent application of pressure, the risk for ischemic injury increases, which might cause the onset of a pressure ulcer.<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref> In the present study, there was a higher incidence of more intense acute adverse events in the group of participants with a smaller decrease in the mean temperature of the nasal dorsum, emphasizing the predisposition of this particular area to skin perfusion disturbances. Souto et al.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>13</sup>
</xref> emphasized that the oronasal mask has several areas that are subject to critical tension values for the development of skin lesions, the most relevant being in the upper lateral region of the nose.</p><p>Weng,<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref> seeking preventive measures against the development of skin lesions in patients using face masks for BiPAP ventilation, found a proportion of 96% of stage I pressure ulcers with hyperemia on the nasal dorsum, which is in line with data from clinical studies in terms of the susceptibility of the area of the nasal dorsum to skin lesions, including its anatomical characteristic of a thin layer of poorly vascularized epidermis covering the bone surface.</p><p>We concluded that the incidence and intensity of acute adverse effects were higher in the participants receiving BiPAP ventilation. There was an association between acute adverse effects of the application of NIV via oronasal mask and less cooling or greater reactive hyperemia in the area of the nasal dorsum after removal of the mask. Thermography can be an additional tool to detect skin areas at high risk of developing skin lesions.</p><p>Methodological rigor in preparing the environment and the participants and a literature review on the optimal conditions to perform thermography are the strengths of this study. However, the study has limitations. The sample was small, involving healthy participants, and the results would probably be different in situations in which other risk factors (age, nutritional status, medication use, presence of comorbidities, and level of consciousness) were present.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">
