The lack of observed effect on mood symptoms may be due to the severity, chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample; recruiting an antidepressant-naive sample experiencing mild, acute symptoms of low mood, may well yield a different result. Future studies taking a preventative approach or using probiotics as an adjuvant treatment may also be more effective. Vitamin D levels should be monitored in future studies in the area. The results of this trial are preliminary; future studies in the area should not be discouraged.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Probiotic</kwd><kwd>mood</kwd><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>stress</kwd><kwd>gut</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>immune function</kwd><kwd>vitamin D</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group specific-use="FundRef"><award-group id="award1-0004867416686694"><funding-source id="funding1-0004867416686694"><institution-wrap><institution>Lallemand Health Solutions</institution><institution-id/></institution-wrap></funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><p>The idea that supplemented probiotic bacteria &#x02013; &#x02018;<italic>live microorganisms that, when administered in adequate amounts, confer a health benefit on the host</italic>&#x02019; (<xref rid="bibr44-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Sanders, 2008</xref>: 58) &#x02013; could be used as a treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD) was suggested, in modern times, by <xref rid="bibr28-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Logan and Katzman (2005)</xref>. A key concept behind this review was that nutritional influences on depression are underestimated and some strains of probiotic bacteria may correct underlying biological factors associated with depression. Indeed, probiotic strains have been shown to lower proinflammatory cytokines (<xref rid="bibr27-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Lin et al., 2008</xref>) and oxidative stress (<xref rid="bibr25-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Kullisaar et al., 2003</xref>) in humans, both of which are associated with mood disorders (<xref rid="bibr4-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Ascoli et al., 2016</xref>; <xref rid="bibr16-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Dowlati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr46-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Stefanescu and Ciobica, 2012</xref>). Gut&#x02013;brain axis research suggests that bacteria in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract also communicate with the central nervous system in the absence of an immune response (<xref rid="bibr12-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Cryan and Dinan, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Keightley et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Many papers have explored the links among gut microbes, brain and behaviour (e.g. <xref rid="bibr11-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Collins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr34-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Mayer, 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr47-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Thakur et al., 2014</xref>). A number of narrative reviews suggest manipulation of gut microbiota composition (usually via ingestion of probiotic supplements) as an intervention for psychological outcomes (e.g. <xref rid="bibr8-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Bested et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr12-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Cryan and Dinan, 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr14-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Dinan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref rid="bibr24-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Keightley et al., 2015</xref>). <xref rid="bibr14-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Dinan et al. (2013)</xref> coined the term &#x02018;psychobiotics&#x02019; to describe probiotic bacteria that produces a health benefit in patients with psychiatric illness. However, these reviews rely mainly on evidence from animal studies in which certain probiotic strains have affected emotional behaviour and brain activity (e.g. <xref rid="bibr9-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Bravo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Messaoudi et al., 2010</xref>). For example, <xref rid="bibr35-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Messaoudi et al.

(2013)</xref> provided the first demonstration that probiotics affect brain activity in healthy humans using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). A recent systematic review found that the human research assessing the impact of probiotics on psychological outcomes is limited, and that the few existing human trials assessed the effect of various probiotic strains on mood in healthy samples only (<xref rid="bibr41-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Romijn and Rucklidge, 2015</xref>). For example, <italic>L. helveticus</italic> and <italic>B. longum</italic> improved mood and anxiety symptoms in a sample of 55 healthy participants over a 30-day intervention period (<xref rid="bibr35-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Messaoudi et al., 2010</xref>). As all existing trials were in healthy human subjects, the review concluded that trials in populations selected for a level of psychological distress, or with diagnosed clinical psychiatric disorders, were necessary to advance the field (<xref rid="bibr41-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Romijn and Rucklidge, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Since the 2015 review, <xref rid="bibr45-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Steenbergen et al. (2015)</xref> reported that a multispecies probiotic formulation reduced cognitive reactivity to sad mood significantly more than placebo in a healthy sample; however, there was no effect of probiotics on Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores in this study. <xref rid="bibr1-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Akkasheh at al. (2016)</xref> reported a group difference in BDI score after supplementation with probiotics or placebo, adjuvant to citalopram, in a sample with diagnosed MDD; however, this result no longer reached significance when controlling for confounders (<xref rid="bibr1-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Akkasheh et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The present trial was a randomized controlled trial testing probiotic bacteria as a primary treatment for mood and other psychological outcomes in a sample selected for low mood. Based on the existing evidence from gut&#x02013;brain axis research, and on models linking mood disorders with inflammation, immune activation and the state of the gut microbiota, the trial was designed to ascertain whether a specific probiotic formulation containing <italic>L. helveticus</italic> and <italic>B. longum &#x02013;</italic> previously found to improve emotional behaviour in animals and psychological outcomes and humans &#x02013; would improve psychological outcomes in our sample.</p><p>This study also aimed to examine whether the levels of blood biomarkers would predict or impact treatment response. Given the association between depression and inflammation, and the effects of probiotics on proinflammatory cytokines, we elected to measure a subset of inflammatory markers (interleukin [IL]-1&#x003b2;, IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor alpha [TNF-&#x003b1;]). Although this particular probiotic formulation has not been tested for effects on inflammatory markers, several strains of <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> have displayed anti-inflammatory properties <italic>in vitro</italic> in human intestinal epithelial cells (<xref rid="bibr50-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Wallace et al., 2003</xref>), and <italic>B. longum</italic> R0175 has been found to improve symptoms of ulcerative colitis in humans, suggesting potential anti-inflammatory properties (<xref rid="bibr21-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Haskey and Dahl, 2009</xref>). We also measured brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), as a decrease in inflammation and oxidative stress may lead to increased BDNF, which is a potential factor in the development and maintenance of depression (<xref rid="bibr6-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Berk et al., 2011</xref>). Emerging evidence suggests that vitamin D is an important modifier of the effects of the intestinal flora on inflammatory processes (<xref rid="bibr30-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Ly et al., 2011</xref>), which is interesting given the association between vitamin D and low mood (<xref rid="bibr2-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Anglin et al., 2013</xref>), and could be an effect moderator in any interventional research using probiotics for low mood; we therefore measured blood levels of vitamin D. In addition to measuring biomarkers of inflammation, we also aimed to ascertain whether presence, severity or change in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms would predict or impact treatment response. There is evidence of high comorbidity of MDD with IBS (<xref rid="bibr17-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Fond et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting some possible common factors in aetiology, such as an increase in systemic inflammation, which has been observed in both disorders (<xref rid="bibr16-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Dowlati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="bibr26-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Liebregts et al., 2007</xref>). It was therefore anticipated that symptoms of gut disorder may be an important moderator of treatment response when testing a gut-directed intervention for mood symptoms.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="section5-0004867416686694"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="section6-0004867416686694"><title>Design</title><p>The trial used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design, in which participants were assigned (1:1) to receive either the active probiotic or a placebo for 8&#x02009;weeks.

After informed consent was obtained, clinician-rated measures were rated based on a personal interview. Blood samples were collected, and participants completed self-report questionnaires on a computer-based survey. Participants were allocated to the next sequentially numbered bag. During the 8-week intervention period, participants were asked to take one sachet at the same time each day, preferably before a meal, by pouring the orally dispersible powder from the sachet directly into the mouth where it rapidly dissolved.

IBM SPSS Statistics version 20 was used for all statistical analyses. Baseline variables were compared between treatment groups using t-tests, chi square tests and Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic> tests. Changes from baseline to the end of treatment were compared using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with the baseline level as the covariate. Changes in measures (iCGI-I ratings) were compared using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Efficacy analyses were completed by an independent statistician. The treatment effects were summarized by mean differences and 95% confidence intervals derived from the ANCOVA/ANOVA models. Adverse events occurring in &#x02a7e;5% of the sample were compared between groups using Fisher&#x02019;s exact tests. Analyses of all psychological outcome measures were completed on an intention-to-treat basis. The last-observation-carried-forward technique was used to impute missing values. Secondary analyses were undertaken on all psychological outcomes using the per protocol set, defined as those randomized participants who took their allocated product for the full intervention period (&#x02a7e;80% compliance) and did not violate the study protocol. Biomarker variables were analysed per protocol. Skewed variables were log<sub>10</sub> transformed. Changes from baseline to the end of treatment were compared using ANCOVA, with the baseline level as the covariate. For log<sub>10</sub> transformed data, differences derived from the ANCOVA models for each treatment group were back transformed for display as geometric mean ratios, with the ratio of these used for the inter group comparison. Data for non-transformed biomarker variables were summarized by mean differences and 95% confidence intervals derived from the ANCOVA models. All significance tests were two-tailed and p-values &#x0003c;0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p><sec id="section23-0004867416686694"><title>Exploratory analyses</title><p>Hierarchical multiple regression was used to examine whether treatment response was moderated by baseline levels of biomarkers. The baseline value of the dependent variable was entered (with any variable found to be correlated with biomarker levels), followed by experimental group and moderator variable. The interaction between the predictor moderator variable and group was then added into the model as the critical term identifying the presence of a moderating effect. Significant interaction effects were examined by calculating regression slopes one standard deviation above and below the mean of the moderator; simple slope analyses were conducted to examine whether the regression slopes differed significantly from zero.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="section24-0004867416686694"><title>Results</title><sec id="section25-0004867416686694"><title>Study population</title><p>From 203 self-referrals between May 2013 and May 2014, 79 adults (age&#x02009;&#x02a7e;&#x02009;16&#x02009;years) with at least moderate low mood completed informed consent and were assigned to the probiotic group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;40) or placebo group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;39).

These underlying biological factors support a proposal made by <xref rid="bibr28-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Logan and Katzman (2005)</xref> that probiotics could be used as a treatment for depression. This study aimed to undertake preliminary testing of probiotics as a treatment for low mood. The lack of effect of probiotics on psychological outcomes in the present study is perhaps not surprising given the incipient nature of this area of research. There are many possible reasons for the lack of effect; some signals from our exploratory analyses may help to break some ground in this field.</p><p>First, it is possible that the findings of this study are restricted by the length of the intervention period or sample size. To our knowledge, the only previous trial to have assessed mood outcomes after probiotic administration in a symptomatic sample is a trial by <xref rid="bibr1-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Akkasheh et al. (2016)</xref>, which reported positive effects of probiotics on BDI scores compared with placebo (although this effect was attenuated by confounders) in a sample of 40 participants over 8&#x02009;weeks; however, this trial used probiotics as an adjuvant treatment alongside citalopram. It is possible that probiotics would take longer than 8&#x02009;weeks to effect changes in mood when used as a primary treatment in a symptomatic sample, as in the present study. Given that most modern antidepressant studies have reported effect sizes of 0.2&#x02013;0.4 (<xref rid="bibr49-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">V&#x000f6;hringer and Ghaemi, 2011</xref>), it is likely that our study was underpowered to detect an effect of probiotics. However, we think it unlikely that the lack of any observable group difference in this study was an issue of power alone, given the remarkably similar change in outcomes in both groups (<italic>p</italic>-value range&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.52&#x02013;0.99). To detect a change at this level would have required a sample of thousands, which would have produced a clinically irrelevant result. In addition, a marginally bigger change was observed in the placebo group than the probiotic group on several outcome measures, which also argues against the lack of observed effect being an issue of power alone. We therefore consider that there were probably multiple factors responsible for the lack of observable effect.</p><p>The lack of effect on inflammatory markers is somewhat unexpected given the elevated inflammatory profile of our sample, and given the probable anti-inflammatory effects of some probiotics, including some <italic>Lactobacillus</italic> strains and <italic>B. Longum</italic> (<xref rid="bibr21-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Haskey and Dahl, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="bibr50-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Wallace et al., 2003</xref>). It is possible that these tests were underpowered and may have reached significance in a larger sample. In addition, although we controlled for time of sample collection in our analyses, it would have been preferable to collect samples at the same time for each participant.</p><p>The severity and chronicity of the current sample is another consideration: mean baseline MADRS score in the present sample was high in the moderate range and almost 70% of the sample reported continuous low mood lasting more than 2&#x02009;years. It is possible that probiotics may be more effective in shorter term or in less severe low mood. Baseline severity and chronicity were not reported by <xref rid="bibr1-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Akkasheh et al. (2016)</xref>, so no comparison can be drawn.</p><p>Recruiting participants not currently receiving pharmacological treatment for their low mood was intended to provide insight into the efficacy of probiotics as a primary, rather than adjunctive, treatment for low mood. However, recruiting a sample of unmedicated participants may have increased the overall treatment resistance of the sample, given that a majority of participants had received antidepressant medications prior to the study and still presented with significant, chronic low mood (self-report). There was an imbalance in prior antidepressant usage between the groups (more of the probiotic group had used antidepressants in the past), which may indicate a higher level of treatment resistance among the probiotic group. Although controlling for the group difference in prior antidepressant usage had no effect on outcomes in this study, it is possible that the overall treatment resistance of the sample is not well represented by prior antidepressant use. We did not formally assess treatment resistance; a standardized measure assessing treatment resistance (e.g. Antidepressant Treatment History Form; <xref rid="bibr43-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Sackeim, 2001</xref>) may have been valuable in interpreting the results of this trial.</p><p>Another potential confounder was that we allowed concurrent therapy on condition that the therapy had been ongoing for 6&#x02009;months. This decision was taken on the basis of dose&#x02013;response research that suggests that sudden improvements during long-term psychotherapy (more than 15 sessions) are only as likely as spontaneous remission (see <xref rid="bibr20-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Hansen et al., 2002</xref> for a review). Although it is possible that the inclusion of these participants may have skewed our results, we believe this is unlikely given that only 6 participants (8%) were receiving concurrent psychotherapy, and there was an equal number of these participants in each treatment group (any potential effect on study outcomes was randomized out between the treatment groups).</p><p>The probiotic formulation used in this trial has shown positive effects on both emotional behaviour in animal studies (<xref rid="bibr3-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Arseneault-Breard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref rid="bibr35-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Messaoudi et al., 2010</xref>) and psychological outcomes in a human study (<xref rid="bibr36-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Messaoudi et al., 2011</xref>). However, despite the existing evidence to support the efficacy of the study product, it remains possible that different strains, more CFU or more strains combined into a single product may be more effective. It is important that the results of the current study are not generalized to all potential probiotic strains.</p><p>Our exploratory analyses appear to show a moderating effect of vitamin D on treatment response. In the probiotic group, participants with high levels of vitamin D at the beginning of the study experienced significantly greater improvement on several psychological outcomes over time than those with low vitamin D at baseline. Baseline vitamin D had no effect on responding in the placebo group. Given the modulatory effects of vitamin D on the immune system (<xref rid="bibr5-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Battersby et al., 2012</xref>) and its role in immune cell development and function (<xref rid="bibr19-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Griffin et al., 2003</xref>), it is possible that the vitamin D status of the host could have an effect on the relationship between the gut microbiota and the immune system: low vitamin D could limit response to probiotic treatment as any changes to the microbiome composition would not necessarily be translated to the immune system. Although this mechanism is unsupported by the lack of any significant effect of probiotics on inflammatory markers in the present study, it is possible that measuring markers of cell-mediated immunity may have been more appropriate. However, it is equally possible that there are other mechanisms that we have yet to consider.</p><p>The current study assessed whether probiotics affect mood and other psychological outcomes when used as a primary treatment in a sample selected for low mood. This study has several limitations which should be addressed in future research. Measures of body mass index (BMI), body fat percentage, dietary intake and physical activity should be taken in future probiotics studies. The lack of intestinal microbiome analysis is a significant limitation of the current study, as we are unable to determine whether this probiotic formulation colonized effectively. It is possible that the lack of observed effect of probiotics on psychological outcomes is due to the size of the sample, the length of the intervention period, the severity, chronicity or treatment resistance of the sample, or the strains used. It is equally possible that probiotics are more appropriate as an adjuvant treatment for low mood or depression, as suggested by <xref rid="bibr28-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Logan and Katzman (2005)</xref>. This is supported by the recent positive trial by <xref rid="bibr1-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Akkasheh et al. (2016)</xref> which showed that probiotics were beneficial to patients with MDD adjuvant to citalopram. Preventative trials giving probiotics to those at risk of gut dysbiosis (e.g. those born by caesarean section or bottle fed in infancy), which record any impact on mental health outcomes in later life, may also prove valuable. <xref rid="bibr40-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">P&#x000e4;rtty et al. (2015)</xref> provided probiotics or a placebo for 6&#x02009;months in infancy and found a group difference in occurrences of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at 13&#x02009;years of age. Early exposure to probiotics may also be protective for developing depression; further longitudinal studies are warranted.</p><p>In testing probiotics as a primary treatment for low mood, further studies testing different probiotic strains, for longer intervention periods and in different populations (e.g. less severe/chronic low mood, antidepressant-naive) are important next steps in this very new area of research. Despite the lack of any observable effect of probiotics on psychological or biological outcomes in this study, future studies are strongly encouraged, and should take into account the findings of this study in relation to vitamin D, low levels of which could hinder the efficacy of probiotic supplements for low mood. The continued investigation of probiotics as a potential primary or adjuvant treatment for mood is especially important in light of the emerging research suggesting a novel biological aetiology of mood disorders, such as the relationship with inflammatory/immune response and mitochondrial dysfunction (see <xref rid="bibr23-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Kaplan et al. (2015)</xref> for a review). The treatments outlined in the clinical practice guidelines for mood disorders recently published by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists (<xref rid="bibr33-0004867416686694" ref-type="bibr">Malhi et al., 2015</xref>) adhere very much to the conventional model for treatment of mood disorders; this new understanding of the aetiology of mental disorders necessitates a new paradigm for treatment. This area of research is in its infancy and, given the enormous burden of mood disorders on Western societies, the importance of continuing to explore the therapeutic potential of probiotics for low mood should not be underestimated.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> The author(s) declared the following potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: Dr Romijn has received research funding from Lallemand Health Solutions.
