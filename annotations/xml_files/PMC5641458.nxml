production of low quality oocyte, especially following ovulation induction. The aim of this study was to investigate
the effects of metformin (MET), N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and their combination on the hormonal levels and expres-
sion profile of GDF-9, BMP-15 and c-kit, as hallmarks of oocyte quality, in PCOS patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This prospective randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial aims to study the effects
of MET, NAC and their combination (MET+NAC) on expression of GDF-9, BMP-15 and c-kit mRNA in oocytes
[10 at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage, 10 at the MI stage, and 10 at the MII stage from per group] derived following
ovulation induction in PCOS. Treatment was carried out for six weeks, starting on the third day of previous cycle until
oocyte aspiration. The expression of GDF9, BMP15 and c-kit were determined by quantitative real time polymerase
chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blot analysis. Data were analyzed with one-way ANOVA.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The follicular fluid (FF) level of c-kit protein significantly decreased in the NAC group compared to the other
groups. Significant correlations were observed between the FF soluble c-kit protein with FF volume, androstenedione
and estradiol. The GDF-9 expression in unfertilized mature oocytes were significantly higher in the NAC group com-
pared to the other groups (P&#x0003c;0.001). Similar difference was not observed between the MET, NAC+MET and control
groups. The c-kit expression in unfertilized mature oocytes were significantly lower in the NAC group compared to
the other groups (P&#x0003c;0.001). Similar difference was not observed between the MET, NAC+MET and control groups

The principal feature of PCOS is the large number of follicles arresting at early growth stage. The cytoplasmic and nuclear maturity of oocytes is reduced following ovarian stimulation and may account for embryo quality in these couples (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>). Exclusive oocyte secreted factors (OSFs), such as growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF-9) and bone morphogenetic factor-15 (BMP-15), belonging to for oocyte competence (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>). The receptor tyrosine kinase c-kit is another OSFs which plays important role in oogenesis and folliculogenesis (<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>). Recent evidence suggest possible involvement of c-kit and its receptor, kit ligand (KL) in PCOS pathology (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>). Indeed, it has been shown that the aberrant or low expression of these exclusive oocyte secreting factors (BMP-15 and GDF-9), lead to over expression of c-kit and its receptor (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>-<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>). Therefore, drugs which can modulate the regulation of these intra-ovarian factors may play a role in the clinical management of PCOS. </p><p>To improve the quality of oocyte, various protocol tion induction along with insulin-sensitizing drugs in PCOS patients. But, the risks of poor response, ovarian hyperstimulation, production of low quality oocytes, reduced fertilization rates and poor embryo quality remains among concern to be dealt within PCOS women undergoing <italic>in vitro</italic> fertilization (IVF) or intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>). Metformin, an insulin-lowering agent, has been extensively used for treatment of anovulation and infertility in PCOS patients. ed (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>). In this regard, background studies indicate that MET does not improve the overall outcomes of assisted reproductive procedure in term of the aforementioned parameters (<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>). </p><p>On the contrary, administration of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) has been shown to improve not only the number and also the quality of oocytes in these patients. This phenomenon has been mainly related to the strong antioxidant effect of NAC, which has been shown to reduce follicle atresia and improve the quality of oocyte (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>). <italic>In vitro</italic>, NAC plays a key role in cell survival through the production of trophic factor and follicular preservation (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>). In line with these reports, Sacinositol and NAC improve ovarian function of PCOS patients. Therefore, considering the fact that oocyte secretory factors are hallmarks of oocyte quality, this study aims to evaluate the effects of NAC, MET and their co-administration on the expression of GDF-9, BMP-15 and c-kit in PCOS individuals undergoing ovarian stimulation in ICSI cycle. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials-methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>Antibodies directed against c-kit and &#x003b2;-actin was

randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
trial, in the IVF Unit of Infertility Research Center of
the Academic Center for Education, Culture and Research
(ACECR), Qom/Iran. 80 infertile PCOS women
at the age of 25-35 years, in the interval between
July 2012 and February 2013, who planned to undergo
ICSI were included in this study (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>). Individuals were
diagnosed as PCOS according to the Rotterdam consensus
workshop (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>). Based on this consensus, each
individual needed to have two out of three criteria: i.
Biochemical or clinical hyperandrogenism, ii. Chronic
oligo or anovulation and iii. Polycystic ovaries at ultrasound
examination. Ethical consideration and further
information on this clinical trial are provided in previous

day of last menstrual period (LMP) of previous cycle
until the day of oocyte aspiration. Oral contraceptive
pills (OCPs) were also included in the regimen for 21
days starting simultaneously with placebo, MET, NAC
or MET+NAC on the day 3 of menstrual cycle prior
to the treatment cycle. For ovarian down-regulation,
daily injections of Bucerelin acetate (1 mg, Suprefact,
Aventis, Germany) were administered from the day 19
of the preceding, menstrual cycle until day 2 of the next
cycle. On the second day on the next cycle if the endometrial
thickness was less than 4 mm, the dose of
Burcerelin acetate was reduced to 0.5 mg.</p><p>Ovulation induction was induced from the day two of
the cycle with average daily injections of 2 ampoules
of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (rFSH,
Gonal-f, Merck Serono S.A., Geneva, Switzerland).
Vaginal ultrasound (Honda Electronics HS 4000-Japan)
was also used to monitor the cycles. 10,000 IU
human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG, Pregnyl, Organon,
Netherlands) was administered to induce ovulation.
36 hours after the administration of hCG, when at
least three follicles had reached the diameters of 16-18
mm, transvaginal oocyte aspiration was performed under
ultrasound guidance and general anesthesia. This
protocol of induction ovulation was used for all the individuals
in the 4 group. During the treatment the participants were asked to report any probable side effects
such as abdominal discomfort, diarrhea and nausea.
Due to these side effects, 20 couples (5 per group) were
excluded from the study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig .1</xref>).</p></sec><sec><title>Preparation of oocytes, follicular fluid and blood samples</title><p>Based on our pervious study, oocytes and follicular

during induction stimulation for ART cycles is increased
number of low quality oocytes which is mainly
related to state of endocrine disorder in these individuals
(<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>). Considering the indispensable role of OSFs in oocyte
development and maturation, many researches have shown
impaired expression of OSFs particularly GDF-9, BMP-
15 and c-kit, may account for low quality oocyte in PCOS
undergoing ovarian stimulation (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>). This may explain, at
least a part of the folliculogenesis disorders found in these
patients (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>-<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>). Background literature in this filed is very
discrepant. Some authors have reported reduce expression
of GDF-9 with no significant alteration in the expression
of BMP-15 (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), while others have shown no alteration in
expression of these two factors both at RNA and protein
level (<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>) in oocyte of PCOS individuals. The exact reason
of such discrepancy is not well understood.</p><p>In continue to our previous study, we demonstrated that
unlike MTE and NAC+MET groups, the administration
of NAC compared to placebo group, improves the maturation
and quality of oocytes and also embryo development
in PCOS patients undergoing ICSI (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Therefore, in this
we aimed to evaluate whether NAC could alter BMP-15,
GDF-9 and c-kit levels, as the main OSFs in the oocytes
of PCOS patients in comparison to MET and MET+NAC.</p><p>Compelling evidence suggest that GDF-9 and BMP-15
members of the TGF&#x003b2; superfamily are exclusively expressed
in the oocyte and their expression increases as follicle development
progresses (<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>). During postnatal ovarian development,
c-kit mRNA and protein are localized in the oocytes
(<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>), and in this regard Brankin et al. (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>) has shown a relation
between KL/c-kit interaction with antrum formation,
steroidogenesis and oocyte quality. Furthermore, genetic and
descriptive studies have implicated the involvement of c-kit
receptor and its ligand, KL, in oocyte growth (<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>).</p><p>Low GDF-9 levels is associated with abnormally increased
KL level in PCOS, which could lead to abnormal
ovarian features such as enlarged oocytes and increased
follicle numbers (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>). In PCOS patients, the GDF-9
mRNA level within the oocytes is lower than in oocyte
derived from normal individuals (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>), and it is believed
that there is a negative association between GDF-9 expression
and KL/c-kit expression. Tuck (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>) believes that
excess androgens may act to further reduce the inhibitory
effect of GDF-9, thus resulting in an abnormal increase in
the KL/c-kit protein level in PCOS individual. Considering
the inverse relationship between c-kit and GDF-9 in
PCOS (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>), therefore, improving the expression of
GDF-9 is expected to cause a reduction in c-kit levels.</p><p>Our results displayed a significant increase in the expression
of GDF-9 in the unfertilized mature oocytes of
PCOS patients after administration of NAC compared
to MET, indicating that NAC, as an anti-oxidant/antiapoptotic
agent, could enhance the expression of GDF-9
through inhibiting the activity of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription
factors, therefore affecting the activity of MAPkinase
signaling and related genes expression (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>), which
may be able to alleviate PCOS follicular disorders and
prevent follicular developmental detention and atresia.</p><p>Our study, in agreement with aforementioned studies, also
showed a significant decrease in the expression of c-kit in
the oocytes of PCOS patients and also the soluble c-kit protein
in the FF following administration of NAC compared to
control. In addition, evidence has indicated the relationship
between KL/c-kit system with MAPK pathway and/or PI3K/
Akt pathway, which are both necessary for follicle development
(<xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>). It is likely that NAC decreases the expression
of c-kit through interference in MAPK pathway, all of this
could be the underlying reason in the role of NAC in preventing
follicular developmental detention and atresia and
alleviation of follicular disorders in PCOS patients.</p><p>Although the FF content may be an invaluable hallmark
for PCOS diagnosis, but the NAC ability to modulate
these intra-ovarian factors of the oocyte may have interesting
pharmacological perspectives for clinical management
of PCOS patients. According to literature (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>),
there is an inverse relationship between c-kit and GDF-9.
Therefore, improves expression of GDF-9 by NAC treatment,
is expected to follow by a reduction in c-Kit and
indeed MET appears to mask this effect of NAC, how this
masking effect is performed, remains to be elucidated.</p><p>In this regard it has been shown that with increased follicular
size and E2 production, the amount of soluble c-kit
protein in human FF also increase (<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>), which is consistent
with the correlation observed in this study between
soluble c-kit with the FF volume, E2, and androstenedione
concentrations.</p><p>It has been demonstrated that the excess secretion of
anti-mullerian hormone (AMH) in the FF of PCOS patients
may directly inhibit the production of OSFs such
as GDF-9 and BMP-15, which can explain the low levels
of OSFs in PCOS oocytes (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>). Our findings showed
a reduction in the AMH level in the FF of NAC treated
group (<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>). Although this reduction was not statistically
significant but may be considered as an underlying reason
for the increased levels of GDF-9 in the NAC treated patients.
Moreover, in agreement with other findings (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>),
our study revealed no significant difference in the level of
BMP-15 mRNA among the studies groups.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Considering the fact that NAC improves oocyte maturation
and embryo quality, and decreases the rate of immature
oocytes in women with PCOS while being a safe and welltolerated
agent, we suggest the administration of NAC as
an alternative to other insulin-sensitizing agents like MET.
Therefore, the present study argues that NAC possibly improves
the oocyte quality of PCOS patients compared to
MET through modulating the c-kit and GDF-9 expression,
indicating that NAC supplement may be a therapeutic alternative
to the insulin-sensitizing agents in PCOS management.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the members of the IVF unit of the Infertility
