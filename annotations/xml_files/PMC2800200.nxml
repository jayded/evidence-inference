Responder analysis may be better, but needs validating for level of response and treatment duration.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>The numbers of patients with pain relief over baseline (&#x02a7e;15%, &#x02a7e;30%, &#x02a7e;50%, &#x02a7e;70%) at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks of treatment were obtained using the WOMAC 100 mm visual analogue pain subscale score for each treatment group in seven randomised placebo-controlled trials of etoricoxib in osteoarthritis lasting &#x02a7e;6 weeks. Dropouts were assigned 0% improvement from baseline from then on. The numbers needed to treat (NNTs) were calculated at each level of response and time point.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>3554 patients were treated with placebo, etoricoxib 30 mg and 60 mg, celecoxib 200 mg, naproxen 1000 mg or ibuprofen 2400 mg daily. Response rates fell with increasing pain relief: 60&#x02013;80% experienced minimally important pain relief (&#x02a7e;15%), 50&#x02013;60% moderate pain relief (&#x02a7e;30%), 40&#x02013;50% substantial pain relief (&#x02a7e;50%) and 20&#x02013;30% extensive pain relief (&#x02a7e;70%). NNTs for etoricoxib, celecoxib and naproxen were stable over 2&#x02013;12 weeks. Ibuprofen showed lessening of effectiveness with time.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>Responder rates and NNTs are reproducible for different levels of response over 12 weeks and have relevance for clinical practice at the individual patient level. An average 10 mm improvement in pain equates to almost one in two patients having substantial benefit.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Clinical trials are performed usually for regulatory purposes, with outcomes typically reported as statistical comparisons between treatment group population means.

An average of 10 mm out of 100 mm (10% improvement; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="ARD-69-02-0374-f03">fig 3</xref>) conveys no expectation of great benefit, with little to balance against known risks. A different approach is needed.</p><p>A pilot study of responder analysis in a single trial indicated that it might be a useful way of reporting pain results in osteoarthritis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> It suggested that at least 50% pain relief after 6 weeks of treatment could be a useful discriminator between interventions of greater and lesser efficacy. This needs validation with regard to different levels of pain relief, and especially duration, given that arthritis treatments are used in the medium to long term.</p><p>IMMPACT provided recommendations for interpreting the clinical importance of treatment outcomes in clinical trials of chronic pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> It suggested that a 10&#x02013;20% decrease in pain intensity was minimally important, &#x02a7e;30% moderately important and &#x02a7e;50% substantial. This meta-analysis used these three discriminator points, together with the even higher discriminator of &#x02a7e;70% pain relief, to perform a responder analysis, calculate NNTs and examine the effects of trial duration.</p><p>Response rates declined as the discriminator level increased for all five active drugs and placebo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ARD-69-02-0374-f01">fig 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="ARD-69-02-0374-t01">table 1</xref>). Using the IMMPACT descriptions for commonly used NSAIDs, 60&#x02013;80% of patients with osteoarthritis can expect minimally important pain relief, 50&#x02013;60% moderate pain relief, 40&#x02013;50% substantial pain relief and 20&#x02013;30% extensive pain relief.</p><p>With placebo and active drugs the proportion achieving higher levels of pain relief increased over time, perhaps due to a natural waning of pain inherent in the &#x0201c;flare&#x0201d; design. The tendency to less response at lower levels of pain relief over time with naproxen and ibuprofen may reflect higher withdrawal rates for traditional NSAIDs over cyclooxygenase-2 selective inhibitors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b31">31</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> Patients may be balancing benefit and harm, with lower levels of relief perhaps not worthwhile in the face of adverse events. In the responder approach, dropouts contribute to the denominator only, whereas with &#x0201c;last observation carried forward&#x0201d; they appear to continue to benefit after withdrawal.</p><p>NNTs were comparable for pain relief of &#x02a7e;15%, &#x02a7e;30% and &#x02a7e;50%, with higher (worse) NNTs for &#x02a7e;70% for both doses of etoricoxib, celecoxib and naproxen. For these three drugs, NNTs were reasonably stable over 2&#x02013;12 weeks. Ibuprofen 2400 mg daily was different, with NNT values generally increasing (worsening) with longer duration. The longitudinal responder analysis provides more insight than population average differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="ARD-69-02-0374-f03">fig 3</xref>). This apparently different behaviour with ibuprofen 2400 mg daily did not translate into a statistically significant difference in NNTs between ibuprofen and etoricoxib 30 mg, nor was a significant difference found between etoricoxib 30 mg and celecoxib 200 mg, or etoricoxib 60 mg and naproxen 100 mg. Establishing a dose-response in analgesic trials is known to be difficult even where direct comparisons are available in relatively simple models such as postoperative pain.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> Demonstrating an absolute difference in response of 10% requires a substantial number of trials and patients. Confirming statistically that ibuprofen 2400 mg is inferior to other NSAIDs at commonly used doses in osteoarthritis will require more data.</p><p>A range of &#x000b1;0.5 NNT was proposed to determine whether an NNT has &#x0201c;clinical relevance&#x0201d;&#x02014;whether the NNT is within acceptable bounds of clinical &#x0201c;accuracy&#x0201d;.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref> A subsequent proposal was that &#x000b1;0.5 NNT could be used to determine that NNTs were different.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref> If a numerical difference between NNTs of 1 (eg, 3.5 vs 5.0) was taken to be important, then the application to NNTs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="ARD-69-02-0374-t01">table 1</xref> would begin to differentiate between drugs, with ibuprofen particularly being judged less effective.</p><p>The results of the responder analysis achieve the same global conclusions as the original trials&#x02014;namely, that etoricoxib and its comparators have useful analgesic properties in osteoarthritis. Arguably the most important outcome from these analyses is that, for osteoarthritis, patients and professionals can be provided with trial data that translate into clinical practice by using realistic estimates of the chance of achieving a particular level of benefit. For pain, a mean difference of 10 mm over placebo translates into about 40% having substantial benefit and 30% not having even minimal benefit. Most people with osteoarthritis treated with an NSAID at an appropriate dose can expect to get at least a minimal benefit (though 1 in 5 will not), almost 1 in 2 can expect a substantial benefit and about 1 in 5 an extensive benefit. The prospect of a 1 in 2 chance of substantial benefit has considerably more impact than an average 10% improvement in pain. Moreover, the information is conveyed in terms of both the likelihood of benefit (1 in 2) and the extent of the benefit (substantial).</p><p>Patients and professionals are interested in the known associated risks of both common and rare harm. These, too, can be conveyed in terms of likelihood of harm and its consequences.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> Balancing benefit and harm is easier when common language describes both. Providing information about the chance of response at various thresholds might produce a more realistic appreciation of benefits and risks of treatment. There is, of course, the caveat that these results come from flare designs in clinical trials where patient selection criteria may make the population different (less comorbidity, perhaps) than a clinical practice population.</p><p>Responders are defined not just by the level of response but by the outcome used to define response. We chose the WOMAC pain subscale, combining pain associated with walking, climbing stairs, sitting, lying down and at night while in bed. Whether pain is the most appropriate outcome for responder analysis or whether function, sleep, quality of life or compound outcomes like the OMERACT-OARSI set of responder criteria<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref> are preferable remains to be examined. Finally, this type of analysis may differentiate between treatments in a manner that is not possible with population mean changes in pain intensity, and discriminatory power may reside in different outcomes.</p><p>Responder analysis looks promising and much more helpful than an average change of a few millimetres based on populations of responders combined with non-responders.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Population mean change in pain intensity reported in clinical trials may be difficult to translate into clinical decision-making and patient expectations of benefit. Responder analyses and NNTs calculated from them are reproducible for different levels of response and over at least 12 weeks of treatment with effective drugs. This offers the possibility of providing patients and professionals with information on the chance of achieving particular degrees of pain relief, improving clinical decision-making and patient communication.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to Merck Research Laboratories for making available data from the original trials.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Christakis</surname><given-names>NA</given-names></name></person-group> <article-title>Does this work for you?</article-title><source>BMJ</source><year>2008</year>;<volume>337</volume>:<fpage>a2281</fpage></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="b2"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Straube</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><name><surname>Derry</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name><etal/></person-group> <article-title>Does this work for you?
