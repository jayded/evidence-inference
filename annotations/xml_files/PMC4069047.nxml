Since endogenous melatonin levels are already reduced at preclinical AD stages, it is important to ask whether replenishing the missing hormone would be beneficial in AD and whether any such effects would be related to the presence of sleep disorder in patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The effects of add-on prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) (2 mg) to standard therapy on cognitive functioning and sleep were investigated in 80 patients (men [50.7%], women [49.3%], average age 75.3 years [range, 52&#x02013;85 years]) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD, with and without insomnia comorbidity, and receiving standard therapy (acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with or without memantine). In this randomized, double-blind, parallel-group study, patients were treated for 2 weeks with placebo and then randomized (1:1) to receive 2 mg of PRM or placebo nightly for 24 weeks, followed by 2 weeks placebo. The AD Assessment Scale&#x02013;Cognition (ADAS-Cog), Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL), Mini&#x02013;Mental State Examination (MMSE), sleep, as assessed by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) and a daily sleep diary, and safety parameters were measured.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Patients treated with PRM (24 weeks) had significantly better cognitive performance than those treated with placebo, as measured by the IADL (<italic>P</italic>=0.004) and MMSE (<italic>P</italic>=0.044). Mean ADAS-Cog did not differ between the groups. Sleep efficiency, as measured by the PSQI, component 4, was also better with PRM (<italic>P</italic>=0.017). In the comorbid insomnia (PSQI &#x02265;6) subgroup, PRM treatment resulted in significant and clinically meaningful effects versus the placebo, in mean IADL (<italic>P</italic>=0.032), MMSE score (+1.5 versus &#x02212;3 points) (<italic>P</italic>=0.0177), and sleep efficiency (<italic>P</italic>=0.04). Median ADAS-Cog values (&#x02212;3.5 versus +3 points) (<italic>P</italic>=0.045) were significantly better with PRM. Differences were more significant at longer treatment duration. PRM was well tolerated, with an adverse event profile similar to that of placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Add-on PRM has positive effects on cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in AD patients compared with placebo, particularly in those with insomnia comorbidity. The results suggest a possible causal link between poor sleep and cognitive decline.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>acetylcholinesterase inhibitors</kwd><kwd>memantine</kwd><kwd>insomnia</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer&#x02019;s disease (AD), a degenerative brain disorder, is the leading cause of dementia in the elderly. The classic hallmarks of AD are cognitive dysfunction and psychiatric and behavioral disturbances, which lead to progressive deterioration of memory, language, and intellect.<xref rid="b1-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> The degenerative process often produces neurobehavioral symptoms, including sleep disturbances, mainly characterized by nighttime awakenings.<xref rid="b2-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Sleep has an important role in memory consolidation.<xref rid="b3-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="b4-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Emerging evidence links poor sleep to increased AD risk and memory loss.<xref rid="b5-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b8-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> However, to prove causality, it is important to show that improvement in sleep can ameliorate the disease.</p><p>The loss of cholinergic function is believed to contribute significantly to memory loss and cognitive dysfunction in AD. This deficiency can be partially alleviated by treatment with cholinergic agents, such as acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.<xref rid="b9-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, alone or together with memantine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist aimed at neuroprotection against glutamate neurotoxicity,<xref rid="b10-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> are the first-line drugs for AD today.

It has a major role in regulation of the biological clock, particularly the sleep&#x02013;wake cycle and the induction of physiological sleep.<xref rid="b17-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> Early neuropathological changes in AD are accompanied by decreased CSF melatonin levels.<xref rid="b18-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> The reduced melatonin levels are already found in the preclinical stages and correlate significantly with the severity of mental and sleep impairments in demented patients.<xref rid="b19-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></p><p>Several studies, mostly open label, have reported on the beneficial effects of melatonin on cognitive decline and sleep in AD and in patients with mild cognitive impairment.<xref rid="b20-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b25-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> Of these, six were randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, with a total of 310 AD patients, mostly with advanced disease. These studies differed considerably in design, patient inclusion/exclusion criteria, melatonin preparations and doses used, end points, and treatment duration. Therefore, the questions, whether melatonin has beneficial effects on cognitive functions in AD, whether its effects are beyond those provided by the standard AD therapy, whether they are sustained over time, and to what extent the effects are driven by improvement in sleep, remain unanswered. These questions were addressed in the current study.</p><p>A prolonged-release melatonin (PRM) formulation (Circadin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2 mg; Neurim Pharmaceuticals Ltd, Tel Aviv, Israel) was developed in order to circumvent the fast clearance of melatonin in the body (half-life [T<sub>1/2</sub>] =0.54&#x02013;0.67 hours) and has been licensed since 2007 in Europe, Australia, and other countries, for insomnia in patients aged 55 and older.<xref rid="b17-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> In the target population, PRM provides significant and clinically meaningful improvements in sleep quality, sleep onset latency, and quality of life and importantly, morning alertness and psychomotor performance.<xref rid="b26-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b28-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> In particular, it is not associated with negative effects on anterograde memory or cognitive functioning that are impaired in AD.<xref rid="b29-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> Because good sleep quality is imperative for cognitive functioning, particularly at older age,<xref rid="b5-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b30-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> the improvement of nighttime sleep and daytime alertness with PRM in AD patients may potentially also alleviate the sleep-related deficits in cognitive functioning.

The study protocol, informed consents, and amendments were approved in writing by the appropriate local site Independent Ethics Committee (IEC)/Institutional Review Boards (IRB) (National Health Service [NHS]-Scotland) (IEC, Helsinki Committee/IRB).</p><p>All potential candidates for the study were given a current copy of the Informed Consent Form (ICF) to read. Appropriate translations were provided in the native language of the subject. The investigator, study physician, or authorized investigative staff member explained all aspects of the study in lay language and answered all of the candidates&#x02019; questions regarding the study. The candidates wishing to participate in the study were asked to sign the ICF. No study procedure was performed prior to signing the ICF. Subjects who refused to participate or who withdrew from the study were treated without prejudice. All subjects were given a copy of the signed ICF. Altogether, three ICFs were obtained for each participant outlining: the patient consent to participate, the caregiver consent for patient participation, and the caregiver consent to participate.</p><p>The patients were recruited outpatients. A total of 80 male and female outpatients (ages 50&#x02013;85) diagnosed with mild to moderate AD and Mini&#x02013;Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of &#x02265;15 were recruited to the study. Patients had to have no evidence of focal disease to account for dementia, as established by computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. Following diagnosis, all patients underwent a 2-week single-blind, placebo run-in period, followed by double-blind randomization to treatment with PRM (Circadin<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 2 mg) or placebo for 24 weeks and a 2-week placebo run-out period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-cia-9-947">Figure 1</xref>). To prevent bias, matching placebo tablets, which were identical in appearance, taste, and odor, were used. The treatment was double-blinded, with two parallel treatment groups. Selection for a treatment group was determined by a computer-generated randomization list, in a 1:1 ratio (PRM 2 mg:placebo), using the randomized permuted blocks method. The patients were not synchronized in their living habits, except that study medication was administered orally, one tablet/day, 1&#x02013;2 hours before bedtime, preferably at 9 pm, after dinner. In addition, patients were instructed to spend 2 hours a day in outdoor daylight. Patients had to have been on stable doses of acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (with or without memantine) for 2 months prior to recruitment. Patients who were using melatonin during the preceding 2 weeks or benzodiazepines or other hypnotics during the preceding 4 weeks and throughout the run-in period, were excluded.</p></sec><sec><title>Assessments</title><p>The efficacy measures included the change, from baseline to 12 and 24 weeks of the double-blind treatment period, on cognitive parameters assessed by the AD Assessment Scale&#x02013;Cognition (ADAS-Cog),<xref rid="b33-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL),<xref rid="b34-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> and MMSE score<xref rid="b35-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> (at 24 weeks).

The study was thus planned to look at the effects of add-on PRM on cognition and sleep in 140 mild to moderate AD patients, with and without insomnia comorbidity, treated with standard AD therapy.</p><p>Due to severe difficulties in recruitment of patients, the study was stopped after about half of the intended patients (80) were recruited.

Assessments were made of changes in cognitive functioning and sleep since insomnia itself might negatively impact cognitive functioning. All end points were analyzed, both for the total FAS population (N=65) and for the subpopulation of patients suffering from comorbid insomnia (PSQI &#x02265;6 at baseline [N=13]). The results show evidence of efficacy and safety of long-term add-on PRM in mild and moderate AD and particularly, in patients with comorbid insomnia.</p><sec><title>Effects on cognition</title><p>In agreement with published data on the change in the ADAS-Cog parameter in AD patients treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, with and without memantine,<xref rid="b9-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> there was no significant deterioration in mean group cognitive state, as measured by the ADAS-Cog, for both treatment groups, after 24 weeks of the double-blind period. The median ADAS-Cog deteriorated somewhat in the placebo and improved in the PRM group, but the difference between groups was not statistically significant. Compatible with this notion, longer treatment periods and a larger sample size than those used in our study are needed to demonstrate significant decline in the ADAS-Cog score in the placebo group and demonstrate PRM treatment effects with this instrument. The other two instruments (MMSE and IADL) were evidently more sensitive to change within a 24-week period. Thus, cognition, as measured by the MMSE, deteriorated significantly in the placebo group over the 24-week period but did not change in the PRM group. The difference between the PRM and placebo effects was significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.044). Furthermore, after the 24-week, double-blind treatment period, PRM demonstrated clinically meaningful and statistically significant amelioration over placebo for self-care and activities of daily living, as measured by the IADL (<italic>P</italic>=0.004).</p><p>The benefit was even more pronounced in the subpopulation suffering from insomnia comorbidity. There was an improvement (decrease) of &#x02212;3.5 points in median ADAS-Cog scores in the PRM and deterioration of +3 points in the placebo group after 24 weeks of double-blind treatment, and the difference in treatment effect between groups was significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.045). The difference in treatment effect between the groups (6.5 points on the median ADAS-Cog) was considered clinically meaningful.<xref rid="b43-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>,<xref rid="b44-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></p><p>Moreover, PRM improved MMSE scores over placebo, showing an increase in MMSE scores after 24 weeks of 1.5 points, while the placebo group scores deteriorated by 2.8 points. The difference in treatment effects in MMSE (4.5 points) with PRM over placebo in the insomnia subpopulation was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>=0.0177) and was considered clinically meaningful.<xref rid="b45-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Furthermore, there was a significantly lesser deterioration in mean IADL score with PRM compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic>=0.0319).</p><p>The effect on IADL was more pronounced after 24 weeks than after 12 weeks of treatment. This might suggest amelioration of disease progression with PRM compared with placebo. However, it is quite clear that the decline in IADL in the placebo arm at 12 weeks was low, if a linear decline was to be expected. This can be possibly attributed to time-dependent changes in the placebo effect previously shown to mostly affect the first assessments of cognitive functioning in AD trials.<xref rid="b46-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>,<xref rid="b47-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">47</xref> Further long-term trials will be needed to examine whether the greater effect of PRM with longer treatment duration represents attenuation of cognitive decline.</p></sec><sec><title>Effects on sleep</title><p>Most patients in the FAS population did not have insomnia, and thus, as expected, the treatment effect of PRM compared with that of placebo on the global PSQI score did not reach statistical significance.</p><p>Despite the absence of insomnia comorbidity in the FAS population, PSQI component 4, measuring sleep efficiency, improved significantly in the PRM group over placebo after 24 weeks of treatment (<italic>P</italic>=0.017) and over the entire 24-week, double-blind treatment period (MMRM, <italic>P</italic>=0.0312). In the comorbid insomnia subpopulation, despite the small sample size, sleep efficiency improved significantly in the PRM group over placebo after 24 weeks of treatment (<italic>P</italic>=0.04).</p><p>Altogether, the results obtained for the sleep variables are suggestive of beneficial effects of add-on PRM therapy on sleep maintenance in the AD patients. Notably, the sleep parameter mostly affected by PRM in AD patients is sleep efficiency, which is also the main parameter affected by the disease.<xref rid="b2-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b48-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Such effects, according to studies in children with neurodevelopmental disorders, may be more pronounced with PRM formulations because they are able to sustain active melatonin levels throughout the night.<xref rid="b49-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b51-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Beside sleep, the ability of melatonin to affect hippocampal networks and subsequently cognition may rely on presence of the hormone at high levels during the night, when this area is sensitive to the hormone.<xref rid="b52-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="b53-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>Several studies, including six randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, with a total of 310 AD patients, have previously reported on the effects of melatonin on sleep in AD patients, mostly with advanced disease. In three of these studies (N=83), there were no significant effects of melatonin (1.5&#x02013;6 mg sustained-release formulations, 3&#x02013;8.5 mg immediate-release formulations, 10 days &#x02013;7 weeks) compared with placebo on sleep or behavioral aspects.<xref rid="b54-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b56-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">56</xref> In one study (N=50), light treatment plus melatonin (5 mg, 10 weeks) increased daytime wake, activity levels, and strengthened the rest&#x02013;activity cycle,<xref rid="b57-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">57</xref> and in another study (N=20 unmedicated patients), there were significant improvements in ADAS-Cog and ADAS-non-Cog scores with melatonin (3 mg, 4 weeks) compared with placebo but no significant differences in MMSE scores and sleep, although it is unknown whether such effects were sustained at longer treatment duration.<xref rid="b21-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> It is interesting to note that most studies reporting negative effects of melatonin on sleep in AD used actigraphy to assess sleep. In another study of 2.5 mg sustained-release melatonin for 2 months in AD patients (N=157), both actigraphy and caregiver ratings of sleep were used. Whereas caregiver ratings of sleep quality showed improvement with melatonin compared with placebo treatment, the actigraphy data failed to show significant differences between treatment groups, and no other benefit was reported.<xref rid="b58-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">58</xref> The use of actigraphy as a substitute for sleep polysomnography in AD patients was recently debated.<xref rid="b59-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>,<xref rid="b60-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">60</xref> On the other hand, sleep quality can be negatively affected by emotional distress and caregiver burden. It is thus possible that actigraphy and subjective assessments of sleep will differ in reported sleep parameters and treatment effects. These methodological differences, in addition to differences in study design, duration, melatonin formulation, and dose, may account for the inconsistencies between results obtained in the previous studies.</p><p>A pertinent question is whether the effects of add-on PRM treatment on sleep were similar in AD patients with insomnia comorbidity to those previously seen in nondemented patients with insomnia aged 55 years and older. The results of this study show that as for AD patients, the improvement in sleep develops progressively, reaching stable plateau levels at 12 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f4-cia-9-947">Figure 4A and B</xref>). A similar evolution of response with time of treatment was reported previously in nondemented patients with insomnia aged 55 and older<xref rid="b61-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">61</xref> and was considered to represent consolidation of the circadian system.</p><p>The greater effects of PRM on cognition in the insomnia subpopulation support the notion that sleep is critical for memory performance. Recent studies indicate that sleep duration and sleep quality may play a role in cognitive performance in healthy older adults.<xref rid="b5-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> A recent study on sleep quality and preclinical AD concluded that beta-amyloid deposition in the preclinical stage of AD is associated with worse sleep quality but not with changes in sleep quantity.<xref rid="b62-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> PRM restores the body&#x02019;s normal sleep&#x02013;wake cycle, improves sleep quality and daytime functioning, maintains the physiological sleep structure in insomnia patients, and as found in the present study, improves sleep maintenance in AD patients.<xref rid="b26-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="b63-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">63</xref> This may explain the improvement in ADAS-Cog, IADL, and MMSE observed in AD patients with insomnia comorbidity after PRM treatment. Importantly, treatment of the sleep complaints with traditional hypnotics may not be beneficial and may even be deleterious in AD patients because of the impairments in cognitive and memory functioning associated with these drugs.<xref rid="b11-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b13-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Furthermore, long-term use of benzodiazepine hypnotics is associated with an increased risk for dementia.<xref rid="b15-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b16-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Because PRM improves sleep without the risk of memory or cognitive impairment, the improvement of sleep can further contribute to the overall efficacy of PRM in AD, as found in the present study.<xref rid="b13-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b29-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="b64-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">64</xref> The efficacy results obtained in AD patients with insomnia comorbidity are most interesting, in particular with respect to the interaction between insomnia and AD, and larger studies of PRM in this population are warranted.</p><p>An important question is whether the add-on PRM treatment was attenuating disease progression. Evaluation of the change in the cognitive parameters over time indicates that while the placebo group deteriorated progressively during the 24 weeks (as measured by the IADL and MMSE), a significantly lesser decline in cognitive functioning was seen in the PRM-treated cohort after 12 and 24 weeks of treatment, suggesting that PRM attenuated the cognitive decline. Further studies will have to be undertaken to understand whether this trend could represent disease modification.</p><p>There is now compelling evidence for the association between shorter sleep duration and poor sleep quality to greater beta amyloid burden and higher risk for AD.<xref rid="b7-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="b8-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b62-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="b65-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>,<xref rid="b66-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">66</xref> Based on the aforementioned evidence and the results obtained from our study, a plausible mechanism for PRM effects in AD could be that the improved sleep efficiency leads to lower risk of accumulation of beta amyloid deposition<xref rid="b62-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">62</xref> and/or increase in beta amyloid clearance from the brain,<xref rid="b65-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">65</xref> which can ultimately result in the attenuation of AD progression. If so, patients with good sleep quality can potentially also benefit from the neuroprotective effects of the hormone.<xref rid="b67-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>,<xref rid="b68-cia-9-947" ref-type="bibr">68</xref></p><p>Overall, PRM was well tolerated as most AEs were of mild or moderate severity and resolved without sequelae. No deaths occurred during the study, and none of the SAEs reported were considered related to the study drug.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>We conclude that the add on of PRM to acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, with or without memantine therapy, might be an effective and safe means for improvement in cognitive functioning and sleep maintenance in mild to moderate AD patients. The benefit may be greater for those with insomnia comorbidity, probably because good sleep is critical for proper cognition and memory processing. Keeping in mind that larger sample size and longer study duration are required in order to validate these results, the results are compatible with the accumulating evidence on a causal relationship between poor sleep and cognitive decline in AD.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary materials</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1-cia-9-947"><table-wrap id="ts1-cia-9-947" position="float"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Baseline characteristics of the study population</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="2" colspan="1">Parameter</th><th align="left" valign="top" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PRM
