Four hundred patients with pre-diabetes at five centres were treated for 12months and followed for an additional 12months to investigate the preventative effects of JQJT tablets (Registration ID: ChiCTR-PRC-09000401). The incidence rate of diabetes mellitus was the primary endpoint. The risk of converting from pre-diabetes to diabetes was 0.58-fold less in the JQJT tablets group than in the placebo group [HR (95% CI): 0.58 (0.384, 0.876), P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.010]. Furthermore, the probability of achieving normalized blood glucose was 1.41-fold greater in the JQJT tablets group than in the placebo group [HR (95% CI): 1.41 (1.002, 1.996), P&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0049]. ITT analysis revealed that the incidence of diabetes upon treatment completion was 16.5% in the JQJT tablets group compared with 28.9% in the control group. The percentage of patients with normalized blood glucose upon 12-month intervention was 41.8% in the JQJT tablets group compared with 27.8% in the control group. JQJT tablets could be an effective intervention for preventative treatment of Type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2017</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Diabetes is a major threat to global health. The incidence of diabetes is rapidly increasing worldwide, and many pre-diabetic patients are converting to diabetes. The most recent estimate by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) is that 8.3% of adults, representing 382 million people globally, have diabetes, and the number is predicted to rise beyond 592 million within 25 years. Annually, 510 million of the world&#x02019;s population dies from diabetes-related diseases, accounting for 8.39% of all deaths<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>. Furthermore, diabetes cost at least 548 billion US health expenditure dollars in 2013&#x02014;11% of total health spending on adults. Despite the heavy social and financial burdens that diabetes incurs<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, public awareness of the disease and its potential harms and treatment options is low<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Approximately half of patients suffering from diabetes are not aware of their illness<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Pre-diabetes is a health condition in which a person&#x02019;s blood sugar is higher than normal but not yet not high enough for a medical diagnosis of diabetes. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimated that 79 million Americans (approximately 35% of the population over 20 years old) have pre-diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>, and up to 70% of these patients eventually progress to diabetes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref></sup>.The average risk of developing diabetes is approximately 5&#x02013;10% per year in individuals with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) compared with approximately 0.7% per year in normoglycemic individuals<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup>. In 2013, the global prevalence of IGT was estimated at 316 million&#x02014;a number expected to rise to 471 million by 2035<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>.Facing this reality, the WHO believes that prevention is the best cure, and early prevention is required for the pre-diabetes population. Pre-diabetes is a critical state in which abnormal blood sugar could be restored to normal levels if adequate intervention is initiated. Traditional Chinese medical practice has a long-standing tradition of prioritizing disease prevention over treatment. <italic>The Yellow Emperor&#x02019;s Classic of Internal Medicine</italic> (HuangdiNeijing,in Chinese pinyin, compiled approximately 770&#x02013;221 B.C.) recorded therapeutic concepts such as&#x0201c;medical practitioners of high proficiency intervene before one fallsill&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;prevention is the best treatment&#x0201d;. Currently, treatment options for pre-diabetes are scarce. We believe that traditional Chinese therapy may provide a promising means of diabetes prevention.</p><p id="Par4">Developed by the Institute of Materia Medica of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences, JQJT tablets are the first new Chinese patent drug to be approved by the Chinese Food and Drug Administration(CFDA) for diabetes treatment<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.JQJT tablets are composed of berberine, astragalus and honeysuckle, and the main functions include clearing heat, replenishing qi and engendering body fluids to check thirst. The multiple components of JQJT tablets have been shown in laboratory settings to improve insulin resistance by regulating glucose and lipid metabolism, inhibiting oxidation and boosting immune function<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par5">The cultivation and manufacture of raw materials for JQJT tablets is in accordance with the Good Agriculture Practice and Good Manufacturing Practice Standards. Our group found that the HPLC determination of&#x000a0;11 different batches of JQJT tablets samples (see Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>) exhibited characteristic co-possessing peaks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>, a proof of the consistency of drug quality. Of all the co-possessing peaks, peak No. 2 was identified as chlorogenic acid, No. 5 as rutin, No. 15 as 4,5 -dicaffeoylquinic acid, No. 17 as luteoloside, No. 23 as Jatrorrhizine Hydrochloride, No. 27 as palmatine and No. 28 as berberine hydrochloride.

The experimental and control drugs were manufactured by Zhongxin Pharma&#x000b7;Tianjin Longshunrong Pharmaceutical Factory. Both groups received lifestyle intervention as a basic treatment(health education according to the missionary handbook). Participants were required to make monthly visit to the trial site and visits in the 2nd, 6th and 12th month of the follow-up period.</p><p id="Par27">The use of anti-diabetic drugs and drugs that may affect blood sugar levels, such as enalapril maleate folate, prednisone and furosemide, were forbidden. Other medications or therapies required to treat concomitant diseases were allowed during the study for ethical considerations. Information such as the name of the drug or therapy, actual dosage, and dosing frequency were well-documented.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Randomization</title><p id="Par28">Participants were allocated randomly into one of the two groups with a 1:1 allocation. An independent data centre named Interact Voice Responding System (IVRS) was used to complete the randomization according to a random sequence table (generated bySAS8.2). The randomized treatment assignments were sealed in opaque envelopes and controlled by the appointed individual who was not involved in this trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Blinding</title><p id="Par29">Simulated agents of JQJT tablets were made to ensure double-blinding in this study. Simulated agents of JQJT tablets had the same appearance, shape, colour and packaging as did JQJT tablets; thus, the researchers and participants did not know the identity of the medication. Blinding was maintained amongst the investigators and patients to guarantee the authenticity of the statistical outcomes and final report.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Outcome measures</title><p id="Par30">Primary outcome was incidence rate of diabetes mellitus.

These findings added to the clinical body of evidence supporting the use of TCM for pre-diabetes.</p><p id="Par51">Moreover, the action pattern of JQJT tablets for pre-diabetes had been identified. The onset of action took 3 months or less, and the clinical effects, with respect to decreasing the progression to diabetes and normalizing blood glucose, were most evident during the 12 months of medication.

This finding is inconsistent with the results of our pre-clinical animal experiment, which demonstrated that JQJT tablets reduced FBG levels in both diabetic rats and insulin-resistant rats. In this clinical study, within-group analysis revealed that HBA1c levels decreased significantly from baseline for both the treatment and the control group. However, between-group comparisons suggested that the changes from baseline were not statistically significant, suggesting that JQJT tablets had no effect on HBA1c in the pre-diabetic population.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par53">In summary, JQJT tablets can effectively reduce the rate of conversion from pre-diabetes to T2DM and can improve blood sugar restoration in pre-diabetes patients.JQJT tablets could be an effective intervention for the preventative treatment of T2DM. Short-term use of JQJT tablets is recommended for the prevention of T2DM in pre-diabetes patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p>
