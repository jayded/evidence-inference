Secondary outcomes were the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) and Short Form&#x02013;36 (SF-36) at 1, 3, and 6 months after treatment.

In the series by Kon et al<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2325967116689386" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="bibr20-2325967116689386" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> comparing PRP with HA at 6-month follow-up, the best results from the International Knee Documentation Committee questionnaire, VAS, and degree of patient satisfaction were achieved in the PRP group (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .005), especially for younger patients, males, and those with early-stage OA. According to the systematic review by Meheux et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr23-2325967116689386" ref-type="bibr">23</xref></sup> most of the studies included early-stage OA, with grades 3 and 4 being less common (9.4% of the knees were Ahlback grade 3, 37.9% K-L grade 3, and 12.6% K-L grade 4). In these studies, the worst results were obtained for K-L grades 3 to 4. We expected that our results would be lower than previous ones (in terms of significance) since the average patient age was older and only patients with late-stage OA were included, with 58.5% of knees being classified as K-L grade 4. Nonetheless, in our study, the difference in VAS at 3 and 6 months was greater in the PRP group.</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to determine the clinical utility of PRP IAI in the treatment of late-stage knee OA for subjective pain relief 1 month after the infiltration compared with CSA infiltration, as determined by by VAS. At 1 month, results showed a decrease in VAS in both groups. Although there was no statistically significant difference between groups, there was a 4-point decrease in the control group compared with the study group. This could be explained by the prompt anti-inflammatory effect of corticosteroid. As expected, since corticosteroid effects are known to be short, the VAS for the control group worsened at 3 months while it improved in the study group. This improvement decreased at 6 months, although remaining above that for the control group (8-point difference at 3 and 6 months). Although this difference was not statistically significant, the fact that the study group had worse OA involvement gives more value to the differences in absolute numbers. Both treatments improved the initial state as far as pain is concerned. These findings are consistent with the recently published study of Forogh et al,<sup><xref rid="bibr13-2325967116689386" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> which also compared a single injection of PRP with CSA.

Since we could not find statistical differences between groups in most of the outcomes, we believe that for late-stage knee OA, a serial single injection of high-concentration PRP (PAW classification type 4) might reduce the pain enough and for longer periods, with an adequate quality of life, to delay knee replacement.</p><p>Our study has several limitations. Although a sample size calculation was performed to detect a reduction of 17 points in the treatment group versus the control group, given that pain is a difficult variable to quantify, the sample might need to be larger. Given that there is no difference in these 2 groups in such a small population, the study could be underpowered and a type II error cannot be ruled out. Note that we did not achieve our target enrollment of 32 patients in the control group. We might look for more objective parameters like joint inflammatory biochemical markers or biomechanical studies to determine the clinical improvement. Another limitation was the lack of imaging assessment to evaluate OA progression, but we consider that in late-stage knee OA, clinical improvement is more valuable than radiographic progression of the disease. The specificity of our work is the homogeneity of the sample: Only patients with K-L grade 3 or 4 OA with enough symptoms to receive joint replacement were included.</p><p>A large randomized clinical trial using a therapeutic regimen based on a serial single injection every 6 months, with objective indicators and imaging assessment to evaluate OA progression, is needed to further assess the efficacy of PRP treatment in patients with advanced knee OA.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="section10-2325967116689386"><title>Conclusion</title><p>A single PRP intra-articular injection is effective for relieving pain and improving activity of daily living and quality of life in patients with late-stage knee OA.
