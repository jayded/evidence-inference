The following inclusion criteria for women with FMS were used: between 20 and 65 years old and meeting the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 classification criteria for FMS. Even though there exist newer criteria these are the criteria generally used in clinical practice and in most research studies both in Sweden and in other countries. Moreover, in clinical practise in Sweden these criteria have to be fulfilled in order to obtain the ICD-10 code for FMS (i.e. M79.7). The following exclusion criteria were used: high blood pressure (&#x0003e;160/90 mmHg), osteoarthritis in hip or knee, other severe somatic or psychiatric disorders, primary causes of pain other than FMS, high consumption of alcohol (i.e. Audit &#x0003e;6 according to the recommendations for women), participation in a rehabilitation program within the past year, regular resistance exercise training or relaxation exercise training more than twice a week, inability to understand or speak Swedish, and not being able to refrain from analgesics, NSAID, or hypnotics for 48 hours before examinations.</p><p>The patients were recruited by newspaper advertisement in the local newspapers of three cities in Sweden (Gothenburg, Stockholm, and Link&#x000f6;ping) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0162010.g001">Fig 1</xref></bold>).

The algometry was conducted approximately one week before the microdialysis. The area of the contact area was 1 cm<sup>2</sup> and pressure was applied perpendicularly to the skin at a speed corresponding to approximately 50 kPa/s. The subjects were instructed to mark the pressure pain threshold (PPT) by pressing a button as the sensation of &#x0201c;pressure&#x0201d; changed to &#x0201c;pain&#x0201d;. When the button was pressed or when the maximum pressure of 1 500 kPa was reached, the application of pressure ceased. Algometry was performed bilaterally over the supraspinatus muscle (at origins above the scapula spine near the medial border), the lateral epicondyle (2-cm distal to the epicondyles), over the gluteus maximus (in upper outer quadrants of buttocks in anterior fold of muscle), and inside of the knee (at the medial fat pad proximal to the joint line).

The main goal of the exercise intervention was to improve muscle strength and health status by progressive resistance exercise, but without risking increased pain while loading the muscles [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. The exercise intervention lasted 15 weeks and each session was performed twice a week. Each session was performed under the supervision of specially trained physical therapists. It was conducted at physiotherapy premises and at a local gym at the different sites in groups compromising five to seven participants to promote interaction between participants and to facilitate physiotherapeutic guidance. The intervention was proceeded by an individual introductory meeting. Low intensity of exercise adjusted to individual limitations works well in most patients with FMS [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. For this study, we initiated resistance training at 40% of the one repetition maximum (1 RM) and successively progressed to 70&#x02013;80% of 1RM. This exercise mode has previously shown to be feasible in FMS [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Each session started with a 10-minute warm up (stationary bicycle) followed by a 50-minute resistance training protocol. In order to promote the participant&#x000b4;s sense of control and to avoid possible negative effects related to exercise, the exercise was initiated at low loads, and possibilities for progression of loads were evaluated every 3&#x02013;4 weeks in dialogue between the physiotherapist and participant.

Substances can pass by simple diffusion across the dialysis membrane along the concentration gradient. The dialysate is analysed chemically. MD allows for continuous sampling of compounds in the muscle interstitial space, where nociceptor-free nerve endings terminate in close proximity to the muscle fibres, providing accurate information on local biochemical changes before such compounds are diluted and cleared by the circulatory system.</p><p>The MD session was performed a few days after the clinical examination when the PPTs were determined. The participants were asked not to perform strenuous exercise two days before the study. They were also instructed not to drink any beverages with caffeine and not to smoke on the day of the study. In addition, they were asked not to take paracetamol-medication two days before and NSAID-medication one week before the MD sessions. The participants arrived at the clinical department in the morning after having eaten breakfast. All subjects reported that they had followed the instructions. During the study, they received a standardised meal at the end of the trauma period, but otherwise they were not allowed to eat. They could, however, drink water.</p><p>The skin and the subcutaneous tissues above where the catheter entered were anaesthetised with a local injection (0.5 ml) of lidocaine (Xylocain&#x000ae; 20 mg/ml, AstraZeneca, S&#x000f6;dert&#x000e4;lje, Sweden) without adrenaline. Care was taken not to anaesthetise the underlying muscle. Two commercially available microdialysis catheters&#x02013;cut-off points of 100 (CMA 71) and 20 kDa (CMA 60), CMA Microdialysis AB, Solna, Sweden; membrane 30-mm length, 0.5-mm diameter&#x02013;were inserted parallel to the muscle fibres into the vastus lateralis muscle at half the distance between the trochanter and the knee on the dominant side. Typically, a brief involuntary contraction and change of resistance were perceived when the tip of the insertion needle of the catheter entered the fascia and the muscle. To determine the concentrations of small molecules such as lactate, pyruvate, glutamate, and glucose, the catheter with the 20 kDa cut-off was used [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>]. The catheters were perfused with a high-precision syringe pump (CMA 107; CMA/Microdialysis AB, Stockholm, Sweden) at a rate of 5 &#x003bc;l/min with a Ringer acetate solution (Fresenius Kabi AB, Uppsala, Sweden) containing 3-mM glucose, 0.5-mM lactate, and 3.0-&#x003bc;M [<sup>14</sup>C]-lactate (specific activity: 5.81 GBq/mmol, GE Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK). This procedure was performed according to the internal reference method [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>].

The samples of dialysate from the trauma period were not considered in the present study, which focussed upon the habitual situation of the muscle tissue. After the trauma period, participants continued to rest for 20 minutes&#x02013;the baseline period (denoted <italic>baseline</italic>). The baseline period was followed by a 20-minute period of standardised repetitive dynamic low-intensity exercise of the quadriceps (thigh muscles) (in the following denoted as <italic>20-min work perio</italic>d). The subjects were seated on a bed (back supported) with the knee slightly bent and the lower leg resting on an exercise ball (diameter 55 cm). Participants with current pain intensity in the exercising leg &#x0003e; 40 on a 0&#x02013;100 visual analogue scale (VAS) started at 15&#x000b0; of knee flexion and those with less pain started at 20&#x000b0; of knee flexion. During the 20-min work period, the participants were asked to slowly extend the knee to a straight position (0&#x000b0; knee angle), slowly lower it on the ball, and then immediately repeat the cycle without resting on the ball. Each repetition took five seconds. The experiment ended with a recovery period of 60 minutes during which participants rested on the bed (denoted <italic>recov#1&#x02013;3</italic>). During the MD session, subjects rated the overall pain intensity using a 100 mm VAS (endpoints: 0 = no pain and 100 = worst possible pain). Pain intensity was registered every 20 minutes throughout the experiments except for the exercise period (then every five minutes).</p><p>Samples from both catheters were obtained every 20 minutes for the 220 minutes of testing, weighed immediately, and kept on ice throughout the rest of the MD experiment. The samples were then stored as aliquots in -70&#x000b0;C until analysis. All vials were weighed before the experiment started and after each 20-minute interval to confirm that sampling and fluid recovery (FR) was working according to the perfusion rate set.

Generally the present study focused upon between group comparisons but also within group analyses were made. For the overall analyses, we used mean values of each substance, blood flow, and pain intensity throughout the MD session (i.e. time points: 140, 160, 180, 200 and 220 min). To compare groups concerning background data and data from the questionnaire, we used non parametric tests for the classical statistical between group (Mann Whitney U-test) and within group analyses (Wilcoxon Matched-Pair Signed-Rank test, Friedman's 2-Way ANOVA by Ranks test), as the biochemical substances, blood flow variables, and pain intensity were not normally distributed. It was not possible to transform these variables so that e.g. mixed models analyses could be applied using the available statistical package (i.e. SPSS).</p><p>Classical statistical methods can quantify the level of individual metabolites but disregard interrelationships between different metabolites [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and thereby ignore the system-wide aspect of metabolism and algesics. Classical methods assume variable independence when interpreting the results [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. Multivariate data analyses (MVDA) are capable of handling a number of intercorrelated substances and use advanced principal component analyses (PCA) and Partial Least Squares (PLS) regressions as important tools. When investigating the multivariate correlations between the concentrations of metabolites and pain intensities, PPT and group membership PLS were applied using SIMCA-P+ [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].

The VIP variable (variable influence on projection) indicates the relevance of each X-variable pooled over all dimensions and the Y-variables&#x02013;the group of variables that best explains Y. Hence, variables with the highest VIP were most important as regressors. VIP &#x02265; 1.0 was considered significant. Coefficients (PLS scaled and centred regression coefficients) were used to note the direction of the relationship (positive or negative; in the text reported after the VIP value).</p><p>Multiple linear regression (MLR) is an alternative method when regressing pain intensity and PPT, but it assumes that the regressor (X) variables are independent. If multi-colinearity (i.e., high correlations) occurs among the X-variables in MLR, the regression coefficients become unstable and their interpretability breaks down [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>]. MLR also assumes that a high subject-to-variables ratio is present (e.g., &#x0003e;5) and such requirements are not required for PLS; in fact, PLS can handle subject-to-variables ratios &#x0003c; 1 and can handle several Y-variables simultaneously [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec017"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec018"><title>Background data</title><p>The two groups did not differ in age, blood pressure, or height (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0162010.t001">Table 1</xref></bold>).

The regression of group membership confirmed that [glutamate] and [pyruvate] were important and [lactate] was also important when considering system-wide aspects. Although only three substances had increased concentrations, a relatively massive nociceptive inflow to the CNS may be present if similar alterations are present in several muscles. Muscle nociceptive inputs are believed to be important for maintaining central hyperexcitability [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Moreover, although the levels of glutamate, pyruvate and glucose had decreased after the 15-week exercise intervention and the decreases in two of these substances correlated with decreases in pain intensity it must be noted that FMS was not pain free after the exercise intervention. Taken together this may indicate that other peripheral and CNS factors also are important for pain aspects in FMS. A proteomic study of trapezius dialysate in CWP/FMS found that 1/3 of the proteins were significantly up or down regulated [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], which could reflect nociceptive processes, deconditioning, etc. The present and other MD studies pinpoint the need to move from a search of single molecules to a more systematic approach with respect to metabolites, algesics, and non-inflammatory substances [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec025"><title>Glutamate</title><p>The finding that increased [glutamate] was present before the exercise intervention (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0162010.t003">Table 3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162010.s003">S1 Fig</xref></bold>) agrees with findings from a study of the trapezius muscle of CWP/FMS [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].

No difference in tissue reactions existed between the two groups (<bold><xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0162010.t003">Table 3</xref></bold>), but on the other hand it could have occurred during the trauma phase (not analysed in the present study). An increase in [glycerol] together with increases in [glutamate] and [serotonin] after hypertonic saline infusion have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>], but their relationship to pain is unclear.</p><p>Correlations between elevated [glucose] in plasma and chronic pain have been reported [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref108" ref-type="bibr">108</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref109" ref-type="bibr">109</xref>], while PPT correlated positively with hyperglycemia in healthy men [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref110" ref-type="bibr">110</xref>].

In addition, our study found improvements in 4/5 fitness tests in FMS. Our study also found that the CON exhibited significant improvement in WT-6min and the strength of the knee extensors nearly reached significant improvements.</p><p>The mechanisms for the positive effects of exercise in chronic pain are unclear as mentioned earlier, which hinders the development of exercise interventions aimed at diminishing pain. However, our study found that exercise at least partially is linked to periphearl effects in FMS and that glutamate and pyruvate normalized simultaneous with a decrease in pain intensity. One earlier project has used MD to evaluate the effects of exercise and reported decreased [glutamate] and [substance P] together with increased [beta-endorphin] and [cortisol] in the trapezius of subjects with chronic neck-shoulder pain [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Moreover, the effects on two NAEs differed with respect to type of exercise intervention [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref116" ref-type="bibr">116</xref>]. Hence, two chronic pain conditions showed peripheral changes and decreased [glutamate] after exercise interventions. Karlsson et al. reported that improvements in pain intensity were associated with a decrease in [glutamate] and in an increase in cortisol [<xref rid="pone.0162010.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In this study, improvements in pain intensity were associated with a decrease in [pyruvate]. The reason for this difference is unclear but may be linked to different pain conditions, muscles, and/or exercise interventions were investigated. Although a significant relationship existed, the explained variation was low (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.13), indicating that other substances may be more important with respect to pain intensity. The possibility that the changes in metabolites mainly was linked to improvements in muscular fitness was not confirmed.</p></sec><sec id="sec029"><title>Strengths and Limitations</title><p>The number of subjects in each group was higher than in other MD studies of FMS. FMS shows considerable heterogeneity, so it is difficult to generalize our results to FMS in the population. Both in this and other FMS cohorts investigated by our group, a low severity of comorbidities was noted and there is a risk that the severe cases of FMS were excluded due to nature of the studies. The design of the 15-week exercise intervention made it impossible to determine when the changes occurred. It is important to elucidate when improvements in pain intensity, physical performance, and biochemical substances occur to optimize exercise interventions. Significant differences in BMI and weight existed between the two groups and it cannot be completely ruled out that the normalization of metabolites in FMS was due to improved fitness after the 15-week exercise intervention. Against this can be argued that we found no significant correlations between changes in physical performance and changes in metabolites. In the present study was made no corrections for multiple statistical testing since the tests were not statistically independent, which is obvious when analysing the different time points e.g. for [glutamate] (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0162010.s003">S1 Fig</xref></bold>) between the two groups. Using Bonferroni corrections in such situations will lead to too strong corrections and increase the risk for false negative results. The use of MVDA in the present study mitigates but does not completely eliminate the problem of multiple testing.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Conclusions</title><p>FMS had significantly increased [glutamate], [pyruvate] and [lactate] in the vastus lateralis before the exercise intervention. The increased levels of [glutamate] and [pyruvate] decreased after the 15-week exercise intervention and no group differences were noted. The decrease in pain intensity in FMS after the 15-week exercise intervention was significantly correlated with the decreases in [pyruvate] and [glucose]. As in earlier studies, our study indicates that peripheral muscle alterations may contribute to pain in FMS patients. These alterations can be normalized and pain intensity can be decreased (but not abolished) after an exercise intervention. In addition, the effects of exercise in FMS are partially peripheral.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162010.s001"><label>S1 Checklist</label><caption><title>TREND Statement Checklist.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162010.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162010.s002"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Interstitial concentrations of the biochemical substances and blood flow at the five time points.</title><p>In this appendix are MD results reported more in detail i.e. at the five time points during the MD sessions before and after the intervention in the two group of subjects.</p><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0162010.s002.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0162010.s003"><label>S1 Fig</label><caption><title>Interstitial concentration of glutamate.</title><p>Interstitial concentration of glutamate (mean &#x000b1;
