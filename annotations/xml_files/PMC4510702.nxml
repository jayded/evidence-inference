Between 1 July 2012 and 23 December 2013, adults aged &#x02265;18 years were enrolled from diabetes clinics at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, Sheffield Teaching Hospitals, Sheffield and Kings College Hospital, London, and adolescents aged 12&#x02013;18 years were enrolled from Paediatric Diabetes Clinics at Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge and University College Hospital, London. Inclusion criteria were: type 1 diabetes (World Health Organization criteria); &#x0003e;1 year from diagnosis or confirmed C&#x02010;peptide&#x02010;negative; insulin pump therapy for &#x02265;3 months; four or more capillary glucose measurements per day; and glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level &#x02264;10% (86 mmol/mol).

Each period lasted 4 (adults) or 3 (adolescents) weeks. Identical insulin pump and real&#x02010;time continuous glucose monitoring devices were used during the two study periods, which were separated by a 3&#x02013;4&#x02010;week washout period, during which participants used their own pump and discontinued continuous glucose monitoring.</p><p id="dom12427-para-0010">Signed informed consent was obtained from all participants aged &#x02265;16 years, and from parents or guardians of participants aged &#x0003c;16 years (assent was obtained from minors). Both study protocols were approved by the East of England Central Cambridge Ethics Committee.

During the run&#x02010;in phase, the continuous glucose monitor receiver was modified to mask the recorded sensor glucose concentrations. Downloaded sensor glucose readings were used to optimize the study insulin pump therapy before randomization. Participants had access to sensor glucose readings after the end of the run&#x02010;in phase.</p></sec><sec id="dom12427-sec-0009"><title>Study Procedures</title><p id="dom12427-para-0012">Blood samples for plasma glucose and C&#x02010;peptide measurements were taken after enrolment. Participants were trained on the features of the study insulin pump (Dana R Diabecare; Sooil, Seoul, South Korea) and continuous glucose monitoring (FreeStyle Navigator; Abbott Diabetes Care, Alameda, CA, USA). After the run&#x02010;in period, compliance was demonstrated by the use the continuous glucose monitor for at least 14 (adults) and 8 days (adolescents). Participants used the rapid&#x02010;acting insulin analogue normally used in their usual clinical care and the built&#x02010;in bolus wizard of the insulin pump during both interventions to calculate insulin boluses at mealtimes and when administering correction boluses. Usual basal insulin delivery settings were also applied on the study pump.</p><p id="dom12427-para-0013">The continuous glucose monitoring device was calibrated according to the manufacturer's instructions. The sensor glucose threshold alarm for hypoglycaemia was initially set at 3.5 mmol/l and could be modified by participants. During the closed&#x02010;loop period, overnight insulin delivery was automatically directed by a closed&#x02010;loop model predictive control algorithm <xref rid="dom12427-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>.</p><p id="dom12427-para-0014">The adult participants spent the first closed&#x02010;loop night in the local clinical research facility and received training in the use of the closed&#x02010;loop system. In the adolescence cohort, closed&#x02010;loop training was provided to the participants and parents at home during the first closed&#x02010;loop night. Training lasted for 60&#x02013;90 min and covered initiation and discontinuation of the closed&#x02010;loop system and problem troubleshooting. Participants were instructed to start the system at home after their evening meal, and to discontinue it before breakfast the next morning. Participants were trained to check capillary glucose versus sensor glucose values (calibration check) before evening meals; if sensor glucose was greater than capillary glucose by &#x0003e;3 mmol/l, the continuous glucose monitor was recalibrated and the calibration check was repeated before starting the closed&#x02010;loop system. These instructions reduced the risk of sensor error and the calibration check approach, expected to occur infrequently once every 3&#x02013;4 weeks, was effective when assessed by computer modelling <xref rid="dom12427-bib-0015" ref-type="ref">15</xref>.</p><p id="dom12427-para-0015">No further supervision took place over the following nights and participants used the system fully unsupervised. Participants were not restricted in dietary intake or daily activities. A 24&#x02010;h telephone support service assisted participants in clinical or technical issues that arose during the study. All participants were given troubleshooting literature and user manuals for all study devices. Standard local hypoglycaemia and hyperglycaemia treatment guidelines were followed. The data from the study insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitoring devices were downloaded by the research team at the end of study periods. In addition, during closed&#x02010;loop therapy, encrypted data from the closed&#x02010;loop system was emailed by the participants to the study team once a week.</p></sec><sec id="dom12427-sec-0010"><title>Closed&#x02010;Loop System</title><p id="dom12427-para-0016">The Florence automated closed&#x02010;loop system comprised a model predictive control algorithm residing on a hand&#x02010;held computer linked by cable to the continuous glucose monitoring receiver <xref rid="dom12427-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref>.

A clinically significant reduction in overnight glucose was observed accompanied by reduced time spent in a hypoglycaemic state. Such combined effect has not been documented with any other means of intensified conventional insulin delivery in type 1 diabetes. Glucose variability between nights was reduced by closed&#x02010;loop therapy in the study, whilst increased variability within each night is explained by similarly elevated sensor glucose levels at midnight during both interventions, accompanied by consistent lower morning glucose at 08:00 hours during closed&#x02010;loop therapy.</p><p id="dom12427-para-0029">Glucose concentrations remained lower over 24 h, suggesting there are extended benefits of improved overnight glucose control even when closed&#x02010;loop therapy is stopped. Furthermore, fasting morning glucose levels were 14% lower after overnight closed&#x02010;loop therapy. As a result, participants were able to administer fewer insulin boluses and corrections during the day. This may explain the similar total daily insulin dosage for both study periods, in spite of the 17% increase in overnight insulin delivery during closed&#x02010;loop.</p><p id="dom12427-para-0030">Real&#x02010;time continuous glucose monitoring is associated with a mean HbA1c reduction of 0.5% (5.5 mmol/mol) <xref rid="dom12427-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="dom12427-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref>, <xref rid="dom12427-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> and an unchanged risk of nocturnal hypoglycaemia <xref rid="dom12427-bib-0019" ref-type="ref">19</xref>.

The randomized crossover design of the present study allowed the participants to act as their own control. We acknowledge that the findings were limited by usability of the system. Closed&#x02010;loop therapy interruptions occurred on average once every five nights. More than 60% of interruptions were attributable to disruptions to the pump wireless connectivity or loss of sensor glucose availability.
