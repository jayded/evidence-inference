Treatment adherence has been recognized as an important issue in the management of chronic inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Although many patients can manage their psoriasis with topical therapy alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], adherence remains a significant issue. Adherence is related to both the frequency of applications and the amount of product used compared with the recommended dose; a systematic literature review found that the frequency of topical treatment application in randomized controlled trials ranged from 55% to 100%, while patients applied between 35% and 72% of the recommended dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. A number of reasons for poor adherence to topical therapy were identified, including a lack of efficacy, excessive time applying the medication, and poor cosmetic characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Adherence was shown to be greater for once-daily treatment as compared with twice daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Studies have also shown that the topical vehicle used can impact on adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; patients generally prefer a vehicle that is simple and fast to apply, quickly absorbed and not greasy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p>The efficacy and safety of the fixed combination of calcipotriol 50&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g/g (Cal) and betamethasone 0.5&#x000a0;mg/g as dipropionate (BD) has been confirmed in long-term trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ointment and gel formulations of this fixed combination are established first-line treatments for psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. An aerosol foam formulation of the fixed Cal/BD combination has been developed to enhance adherence and increase the therapeutic options available to patients. Previous Cal/BD aerosol foam studies have shown greater in vitro skin penetration compared with other formulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], and a significantly greater anti-psoriatic effect over 4&#x000a0;weeks of treatment than Cal/BD ointment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], gel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and individual active ingredients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], with a comparable tolerability profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In a large, double-blind, Phase III, 4-week study in patients with psoriasis vulgaris (PSO-FAST [NCT01866163]), treatment with Cal/BD aerosol foam led to significantly greater treatment success rates (53.3% vs. 4.8%; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) and lower mean modified psoriasis area and severity index (mPASI; excluding head; 2.0 vs 5.5; <italic>P</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001) scores compared with aerosol foam vehicle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>This subanalysis from the PSO-FAST study evaluates the amount of Cal/BD aerosol foam used during treatment and the association between the extent and severity of baseline disease, in patients with psoriasis.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patients and Study Design</title><p>Patients eligible for inclusion in the PSO-FAST study were &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years of age with a clinical diagnosis of mild-to-severe body psoriasis.

The mean amount of drug used per week was also similar between treatment groups: Cal/BD aerosol foam 29.8&#x000a0;g/week, vehicle 32.1&#x000a0;g/week. The mean amount of Cal/BD aerosol foam used was consistent from baseline to week 1 (29.9&#x000a0;g/week), from week 1 to week 2 (28.5&#x000a0;g/week), and from week 2 to week 4 (30.2&#x000a0;g/week).</p><p>The total amount of Cal/BD aerosol foam used at week 4 was greater with increasing BSA and increasing severity of baseline PGA and mPASI (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>a&#x02013;c).

</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Discussion</title><p>In the Phase III PSO-FAST study, most patients had mild-to-moderate disease severity (BSA&#x000a0;&#x0003c;10%) and, on average, used 88&#x02013;118&#x000a0;g of Cal/BD foam. The amount of Cal/BD aerosol foam used was comparable to vehicle and the product was used consistently throughout the 4-week study, suggesting that treatment persistence with the foam was good. In addition, patients used an appropriate amount of Cal/BD aerosol foam for the extent and severity of their psoriasis at baseline, since the mean total amount of Cal/BD aerosol foam used increased with increasing baseline BSA, PGA and mPASI.</p><p>The primary analysis demonstrated that significantly more patients using Cal/BD foam achieved treatment success versus vehicle and mean mPASI score was significantly lower for patients using Cal/BD foam than vehicle at week 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This subanalysis shows that the effectiveness of Cal/BD aerosol foam, based on treatment success rates, was not affected by body weight or BMI, so can be used in all patients irrespective of their size or extent of their BSA that is covered with plaques (as long as it is within the approved label). It has previously been suggested that BMI may be a prognostic factor for the response to treatment in psoriasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]; indeed, a number of studies have shown that some biologic therapies are less effective in patients with a BMI &#x02265;25&#x02013;30 compared with a BMI &#x0003c;25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>].</p><p>One limitation of this analysis is that the regular monitoring that occurred during this clinical study of relatively short duration may reinforce patient adherence compared with that observed in the real world. Outside of the clinical trial setting, some patients are unintentionally non-adherent with treatment (e.g., because they forget to use the medication as directed), whilst others are intentionally non-adherent (e.g., altering or stopping treatment because of perceived ineffectiveness or side effects) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, this subanalysis from the PSO-FAST study demonstrates that Cal/BD aerosol foam is used appropriately and is effective for the treatment of psoriasis, independent of BMI and the extent or severity of disease.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Enhanced content</bold></p><p>To view enhanced content for this article go to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/D9E6F06027246DA3">http://www.medengine.com/Redeem/D9E6F06027246DA3</ext-link>.</p></fn></fn-group><ack><p>Sponsorship and article processing charges for this study were funded by LEO Pharma A/S.
