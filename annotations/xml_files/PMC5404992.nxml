The main components were: 1) individual nutrition and breastfeeding counseling in the prenatal and postpartum periods, and 2) nutrition and parenting support groups (NPSG) coordinated with all well-child visits in the first three years of life. Groups of 4-8 families participated together from the 1-month visit until 3 years old.

During these NPSG sessions, the activity curriculum focused on promoting tummy time and unrestrained floor time, and limiting time in movement restricting devices. These groups promoted role modeling by actively practicing skills, including tummy time on yoga mats and interactively playing by placing themselves or a toy in front of the infant. Messages discussed included: 1) doing daily tummy time; 2) tummy time helps develop motor skills and the habit of playing together; 3) just a few minutes makes a difference; and 4) tummy time can involve the whole family.

Second, we described the prevalence of tummy time, unrestrained floor time, and time in movement restricting devices in the whole sample. Third, we examined bivariate relationships between the risk factors for reduced activity with tummy time, unrestrained floor time, and movement restricting time in the whole sample using chi square analyses. We performed logistic regression to determine independent associations between these risk factors and infant activity, adjusting for group status and all family characteristics chosen a priori. Each model adjusted for all the same covariates simultaneously. Finally, we examined bivariate relationships between intervention group status and tummy time, unrestrained floor time, and time in movement restricting devices using independent samples t-tests and chi-square analyses for continuous and categorical variables respectively. Given that parity and education may not have been equally distributed between intervention and control arms, models to determine intervention effects controlling for these two covariates were performed. These models had similar results to the unadjusted analyses and are not shown. This was an intent-to-treat analysis, with all subjects allocated to their given group and assessed based on this assignment. For continuous variables, effect sizes were obtained using mean differences with associated 95% confidence intervals. For categorical variables, effect sizes were obtained using odds ratios with associated 95% confidence intervals. We added interaction terms to determine if these risk factors (health literacy, education, country of origin) moderated intervention effects.

Further research is needed to understand barriers to practicing tummy time on the floor and how they may be overcome by addressing parent concerns about housing crowdedness or vermin. If the goals of infant physical activity recommendations are to promote motor development and future activity, studies are needed to understand if tummy time on an adult's lap or chest, which may actually limit infant movement, has the same impact as being on the floor.

Reasons for these differences and their health implications remain unclear and studies are needed to explore barriers to increasing tummy time among parents with lower health literacy. Active role modeling and practicing of skills may be needed to promote tummy time in parents with low health literacy. Plain language picture-based messaging may help to reinforce these lessons. Although health literacy was not found to be a potential moderator of intervention effect, interaction analyses may have been underpowered to detect this. We also found that country of origin was related to activity. US born mothers were more likely to practice any tummy time than non-US born mothers. These results are consistent with studies of older children showing that immigrant Hispanic children are more likely to be inactive compared with US born white and Hispanic children.<sup><xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></sup> Parents of overweight Hispanic children have been shown to provide less support for their children to engage in physical activity, perhaps a parenting practice that begins during infancy.<sup><xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup> US born mothers, however, were more likely to use movement restricting devices, which may reflect cultural or economic differences. Since US born mothers reported practices that promote and restrict infant activity, additional study is needed to understand the relative implications of these practices.</p><p id="P35">The majority of early obesity prevention interventions have focused on infant feeding. Only a few have reported impacts on infant activity. One Australian intervention study to promote healthy habits using pre-existing social groups, showed no differences in physical activity.<sup><xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref></sup> Another intervention study comprised of home visits found that at age 6 months, the intervention group had higher rates of daily tummy time and began tummy time earlier.<sup><xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Parental engagement and role-modeling have been shown to improve Hispanic children's physical activity.<sup><xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref></sup> Starting Early was likely successful in promoting tummy time and floor time through role modeling, active practicing of skills and building social networks. The effects were found to be dose-related, with improved impacts on activity with increased NPSG attendance.</p><p id="P36">This study has several limitations. Infant activity was based on maternal report and not observational instruments, which can be subject to recall and social desirability biases. However, studies that have documented differences in maternal report and actometer measures of infant activity, found that measured activity may be confounded by caregiver movement and handling of the infant.<sup><xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> Although Starting Early had positive impacts on tummy time and floor time, it did not alter the use of movement restricting devices. While the NPSG included discussions about limiting movement restricted time, they did not incorporate active modeling of how to limit these devices. Future modifications of the program will aim to incorporate this. It is also difficult to disentangle which specific components of the multi-component intervention led to impacts on tummy time. Infant motor development was not collected at this follow-up assessment. Finally, participating mothers were low-income Hispanic women, limiting our generalizability to other populations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="S24"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="P37">Tummy time and unrestrained floor time are uncommon daily practices in low-income Hispanic families. Use of movement restricting devices is widespread. Infant activity was lower among immigrant mothers and those with inadequate health literacy, and use of devices was more common among US born mothers. The Starting Early intervention increased infant tummy time and floor time but did not impact movement restricted time. Longitudinal research is needed to determine relations between infant activity, motor development, childhood physical activity and growth. Primary care-based early child obesity prevention interventions have the potential to promote infant activity. Follow-up of this cohort will allow for analyses of long-term program impacts on infant activity, growth trajectories and obesity.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="S25"><p>We thank the Starting Early staff: Ana Blanco, Lisa Lanza, Janneth Bancayan, Kenny Diaz, Stephanie Gonzalez, Christopher Ramirez and Jessica Rivera.</p><p><bold>Funding</bold>: All phases of this study were supported by the National Institute of Food and Agriculture, U.S. Department of Agriculture, under award number 2011-68001-30207.
