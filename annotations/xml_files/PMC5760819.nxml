Therefore, two compounds, tizanidine hydrochloride and azasetron hydrochloride, had been tried as IS for their similar structures with MDL. Tizanidine hydrochloride was preliminarily chosen as IS for its similarity to MDL in polarity, retention time and extraction efficiency.</p><p id="p0055">Further investigation was developed to evaluate the correlation of recovery between the MDL and IS. 20&#x000a0;&#x003bc;L working standard solutions of MDL with concentration range of 0.0572&#x02013;1.83&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/mL were evaporated, respectively, in seven glass tubes under gentle stream of air at 40&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C.

The measured concentrations and recoveries of MDL and IS were calculated based on the standard curves, respectively.

Six governing parameters: extraction solvent (trichlormethane, ethyl acetate, diethyl ether and methyl tert&#x02013;butyl ether), extraction volume (2, 2.5 and 3&#x000a0;mL), alkalizer volume (0.1, 0.2 and 0.3&#x000a0;mL, 5&#x000a0;mol/L), alkalizer concentration (0.5, 2.5, 5 and 6&#x000a0;mol/L, 0.1&#x000a0;mL), equilibrium time (0, 5, 15 and 30&#x000a0;min) and enzyme inhibitor (0, 5, 10 and 15&#x000a0;mg) were optimized by the univariate approach. According to the experiment, diethyl ether and methyl tert&#x02013;butyl ether both gained good recoveries with no interference and diethyl ether was finally selected as the extraction solvent for its lower price and temperature to evaporate. The addition of proper (0.2&#x000a0;mL, 5&#x000a0;mol/L) sodium hydroxide solution could shift MDL and the IS to their non-ionized forms and improve the extraction recovery. No equilibrium time was required because MDL could bind to the plasma protein immediately after being added into plasma; however, some NaF were necessary as enzyme inhibitor to protect the drug from metabolism in vitro. As a result, MDL was found to be exhaustively extracted with 2.5&#x000a0;mL diethyl ether, 0.2&#x000a0;mL sodium hydroxide of 5&#x000a0;mol/L, 10&#x000a0;mg NaF and without equilibrium time.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>3.3</label><title>Validation of the method</title><sec id="s0060"><label>3.3.1</label><title>Selectivity and specificity</title><p id="p0065">Typical chromatograms of human blank plasma, blank plasma spiked with MDL and IS, and plasma samples obtained after drug administration are shown in <xref rid="f0005" ref-type="fig">Fig. 1</xref>.

The method, which is rapid with run time of 10&#x000a0;min and sensitive with LLOQ of 2.288&#x000a0;ng/mL, has been demonstrated to be suitable for human pharmacokinetic studies of nicergoline.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="bibliog0005"><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref259"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Heitz</surname><given-names>C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Descombes</surname><given-names>J.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>R.C.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>A adrenoceptor antagonistic and calcium antagonistic effects of nicergoline in the rat isolated aorta</article-title><source>Eur.
