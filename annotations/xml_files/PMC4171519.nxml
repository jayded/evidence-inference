Raloxifene improves bone material and mechanical properties independent of bone mineral density. This study aimed to determine if raloxifene prevents the negative effects of diabetes on skeletal fragility in diabetes-prone rats. Adult Zucker Diabetic Sprague-Dawley (ZDSD) female rats (20-week-old, n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24) were fed a diabetogenic high-fat diet and were randomized to receive daily subcutaneous injections of raloxifene or vehicle for 12 weeks. Blood glucose was measured weekly and glycated hemoglobin was measured at baseline and 12 weeks. At sacrifice, femora and lumbar vertebrae were harvested for imaging and mechanical testing. Raloxifene-treated rats had a lower incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with vehicle-treated rats. In addition, raloxifene-treated rats had blood glucose levels significantly lower than both diabetic vehicle-treated rats as well as vehicle-treated rats that did not become diabetic. Femoral toughness was greater in raloxifene-treated rats compared with both diabetic and non-diabetic vehicle-treated ZDSD rats, due to greater energy absorption in the post-yield region of the stress-strain curve. Similar differences between groups were observed for the structural (extrinsic) mechanical properties of energy-to-failure, post-yield energy-to-failure, and post-yield displacement. These results show that raloxifene is beneficial in preventing the onset of diabetes and improving bone material properties in the diabetes-prone ZDSD rat. This presents unique therapeutic potential for raloxifene in preserving bone quality in diabetes as well as in diabetes prevention, if these results can be supported by future experimental and clinical studies.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This project was funded by a National Institutes of Health grant (AR047838) to DBB.

This suggests that bone quality, not quantity, is responsible for the increase in fracture risk in diabetes. Raloxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) used clinically in women to treat post-menopausal osteoporosis. Our group has previously shown that dogs treated with raloxifene have greater femoral and vertebral toughness, despite no significant effect on bone mineral density <xref rid="pone.0108262-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108262-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Similarly, in post-menopausal women, raloxifene decreases risk of fracture with little effect on bone mineral density <xref rid="pone.0108262-Delmas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108262-Siris1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. This indicates that raloxifene improves bone resistance to fracture by affecting bone quality, and may therefore be an agent with potential to improve bone properties in diabetes where fracture risk is higher apparently due to reduced bone quality rather than reduced bone mass.</p><p>The Zucker Diabetic Sprague-Dawley (ZDSD) rat is a recently developed rodent model of type 2 diabetes crossbred from the diet-induced-obesity CD (Sprague-Dawley-derived) and lean Zucker Diabetic Fatty rats (ZDF<italic><sup>fa/+</sup></italic>) <xref rid="pone.0108262-Reinwald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>. Unlike the diabetic obese ZDF<sup>fa/fa</sup> rats, ZDSD rats do not have a leptin receptor mutation, and both sexes develop a type 2 diabetes phenotype of polygenic origin more gradually with age or by induction with a high-fat diet, thus reflecting more closely the pathogenesis of human type 2 diabetes <xref rid="pone.0108262-Reinwald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108262-Fajardo1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. This study aimed to test the effects of raloxifene on bone quality and strength in adult female ZDSD rats. Although we have shown positive effects of raloxifene on bone material properties in normoglycemic animals, no studies have been performed in a model subject to diabetes to determine whether raloxifene in a hyperglycemic environment will prevent increased skeletal fragility.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Animals and Experimental Design</title><p>Twenty-week-old female (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;24) Zucker Diabetic Sprague Dawley (ZDSD) rats (PreClinOmics, Indianapolis, IN) were randomized (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;12/group) to receive daily subcutaneous injections of raloxifene (0.5 mg/kg, Eli Lilly Co., Indianapolis, IN) or vehicle (10% cyclodextrin, Sigma-Aldrich) for 12 weeks, and all rats were fed a diabetogenic high-fat diet (48% fat; 5SCA, TestDiet, Richmond, IN) for the duration of the study. The high-fat diet is used to synchronize diabetes induction. Additionally, in contrast to male ZDSD rats that will develop diabetes with age even while on a normal rat diet<xref rid="pone.0108262-Reinwald1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, female ZDSD rats are more resistant to developing diabetes and require the high-fat diet for diabetes induction and to maintain the diabetic state. Blood glucose was measured weekly by glucometer (AlphaTRAK, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL) and diabetes was defined as blood glucose &#x02265; 250 mg/dL for 2 consecutive weeks. Whole blood and serum samples were collected at baseline and sacrifice. Glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c,%) was measured in whole blood by immunological assay (Daytona Chemistry Anlayzer, Randox Laboratories, Kearneysville, WV). Serum insulin was measured by ELISA (Mercodia Inc., Winston Salem, NC) and serum triglycerides were measured by colorimetric assays (Daytona Chemistry Analyzer, Randox Laboratories, Kearneysville, WV). Serum c-telopeptide of type I collagen was measured by ELISA (Biotang Inc., Lexington, MA). Prior to sacrifice, rats were double-labeled by intraperitoneal injections of calcein (5 mg/kg; Sigma-Alrich, St. Louis, MO) with a 7-day interlabel period and a 3-day period for incorporation and washout (i.e. 1-7-1-3). Bones (femora, lumbar vertebrae) were collected at the time of sacrifice when rats were 32-weeks-old. Femora and L4 vertebrae were wrapped in saline-soaked gauze and frozen at &#x02212;20&#x000b0;C for storage prior to bone imaging and mechanical testing; L5 vertebrae were cleaned of soft tissue and fixed in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin for 48 h, then transferred to 70% ethanol, dehydrated in a graded series of ethanol from 70&#x02013;100%, then embedded (undecalcified and unstained) in methyl-methacrylate with 3% dibutyl phthalate (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for dynamic histomorphometry.

Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT, XCT Research SA+, Stratec Medizintechnik GmbH, Pforzheim, Germany) was performed on the right femur midshaft for cortical bone morphometric properties (volumetric BMD (vBMD), BMC, cortical area and thickness, periostal and endosteal circumferences and x-axis cross-sectional moment of inertia). Micro-computed tomography (&#x000b5;CT, Brucker Skyscan 1172, Kontich, Belgium) was performed on L4 vertebral bodies and the right distal femur for cancellous bone morphometric properties.

While the frequency of diabetes between vehicle and raloxifene treated animals was not statistically different by Fisher's exact test, there was a significant difference by survival analysis using Kaplan-Meier curves. This is not conclusive but at least suggestive of a benefit of raloxifene for prevention of diabetes. The finding that raloxifene might prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes in ZDSD rats was an unexpected outcome of this study. A randomized controlled trial <xref rid="pone.0108262-Andersson1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> found that raloxifene did not improve insulin sensitivity or glycemic control in postmenopausal women who had type 2 diabetes, and a post-hoc analysis <xref rid="pone.0108262-BarrettConnor1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> of the Multiple Outcomes of Raloxifene Evaluation (MORE) trial found no effect of raloxifene on glycemic control in postmenopausal women with or without diabetes, although a beneficial effect was found on serum lipids. However, these two studies did not evaluate the effect of raloxifene on diabetes onset. Conversely, our results are supported by experimental evidence on the effect of raloxifene on glucose homeostasis and diabetes: it has been shown that estradiol prevents pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell failure in diabetic rats fed a high-fat diet by suppressing fatty acid synthesis and accumulation within the &#x003b2;-cells through estrogen receptor signaling <xref rid="pone.0108262-Tiano1" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, and the same research group found similar results with raloxifene in an <italic>in vitro</italic> study <xref rid="pone.0108262-Tiano2" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>. Therefore, a potential mechanism by which raloxifene could prevent the onset or slow the progression of diabetes is by preventing pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell failure. Additionally, two recent clinical studies <xref rid="pone.0108262-Matsumura1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108262-Mori1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref> found a beneficial effect of raloxifene on serum lipids in women with type 2 diabetes, further supporting a role beyond bone for raloxifene to improve health in people with diabetes.</p><p>The fact that none of the raloxifene treated animals became diabetic, while an interesting outcome in itself, was a limitation of this study as it precluded our ability to analyze the effects of raloxifene on bone in rats with established diabetes. However, we were able to show a benefit of raloxifene on bone toughness in a diabetes-prone rat model. While we have previously reported a positive effect of raloxifene on bone toughness in non-diabetic canines <xref rid="pone.0108262-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108262-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, this effect has not been previously shown in bones of normal rats <xref rid="pone.0108262-Diab1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108262-Sato1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. It is possible the predisposition to diabetes in the ZDSD rats creates a therapeutic window for an effect of raloxifene on bone toughness that is not present in normal rats.</p><p>Another possible limitation of our study is that we did not include a ZDSD group on a normal diet. However, this would not have been a true control for the diabetes-prone rats because the effects of the different dietary composition on bone's material properties are not known. Moreover, we did not use CD rats which are sometimes used as non-diabetic controls. CD rats are not prone to diabetes even on a high fat diet, but are prone to obesity, and would introduce additional weight-related variables that could affect BMD or other mechanical properties of bone.</p><p>The effect of raloxifene on bone toughness was significant only for the femur, representing an effect on cortical bone, but a near-significant trend for greater toughness with raloxifene treatment was also observed for the distal femur by RPC, indicating a possible effect on cancellous bone as well. Our previous canine studies showed a beneficial effect of raloxifene on toughness in both cortical and cancellous bone <xref rid="pone.0108262-Allen1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0108262-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Because cortical bone turnover is relatively slow <xref rid="pone.0108262-Burr1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>, the effect of raloxifene on cortical bone toughness implies a direct effect of raloxifene on the existing bone material, rather than on newly formed bone. Furthermore, intracortical remodeling does not normally occur in rats and does not occur in the ZDSD rats. One mechanism by which raloxifene may improve toughness is by altering the hydration of the bone. We have shown that bone beams carved from human and dog cortical bone, when soaked in a raloxifene solution, have greater toughness and that this is associated with higher water content of the bone <xref rid="pone.0108262-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Greater toughness and hydration were also observed in cortical bone beams from dogs treated <italic>in vivo</italic> with raloxifene for 1 year <xref rid="pone.0108262-Gallant1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, our previous canine study showed no effect of raloxifene on BMD, which corresponds to clinical data from raloxifene trials in which fracture risk is reduced with little change in BMD <xref rid="pone.0108262-Delmas1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0108262-Siris1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. Similarly, in the present study of diabetes-prone ZDSD rats, treatment with raloxifene resulted in greater femoral toughness without an effect on BMD, suggesting that raloxifene affects bone strength by improving bone quality rather than quantity. Because people with type 2 diabetes often have normal or high bone mineral density, the increased fracture risk observed in these patients appears to be due to impaired bone quality rather than reduced bone quantity. However, in this study, diabetic rats actually had lower bone density and mass compared with non-diabetic rats. This difference between human type 2 diabetes and the ZDSD rat model might be explained as follows: in humans with type 2 diabetes, overweight and obesity often persist after the onset of diabetes, and excess body weight may be protective of bone mass through mechanical loading or the positive effects of leptin and estrogen produced by adipose tissue. Conversely, ZDSD rats gain weight with the high fat diet until the onset of diabetes, after which they begin to lose body weight due to the catabolic state produced by the diabetes. Indeed, diabetic rats in the present study had significantly lower body weight at the time of sacrifice compared with non-diabetic animals, and this may be associated with their lower BMD.</p><p>The results did not show lower bone resorption as measured by serum CTX in the raloxifene treated rats. However, the numerically lower BFR/BS and MS/BS with raloxifene treatment (&#x02212;26% and &#x02212;27% respectively in RAL versus VEH-ND rats) supports that the raloxifene treatment had an effect on reducing bone turnover. The non-significant differences are not surprising given this study was not powered to detect differences in these outcomes, and that raloxifene is a relatively weak antiresorptive agent <xref rid="pone.0108262-Sambrook1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. However, the magnitude of the difference in BFR/BS with raloxifene treatment is similar to what we previously observed in dogs <xref rid="pone.0108262-Allen2" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>. Additionally, the rats in this study were not ovariectomized, which also may have reduced our ability to detect a significant antiresorptive effect of raloxifene. The rats that became diabetic (VEH-D) had a lower bone formation rate, which is consistent with reduced bone observed in humans and animals with diabetes <xref rid="pone.0108262-Vestergaard1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. Despite the lack of significant differences in bone turnover measures with raloxifene treatment, our results show that raloxifene improves bone material properties, potentially through direct action of raloxifene on the bone matrix, and may prevent the induction of diabetes in female ZDSD rats. The risk of diabetes increases with age <xref rid="pone.0108262-Narayan1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>, as does the risk for bone fragility fractures <xref rid="pone.0108262-Melton1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. If these results are supported by future experimental and clinical studies, they suggest that raloxifene could be a useful drug to prevent skeletal fragility in diabetes with an added benefit of ameliorating the diabetic condition.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0108262.s001"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>
