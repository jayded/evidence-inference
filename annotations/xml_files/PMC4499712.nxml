A systematic review &#x0201c;is a high-level overview of primary research on a particular research question that tries to identify, select, synthesize and appraise all high quality research evidence relevant to that question in order to answer it,&#x0201d;<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> and the well conducted ones tend to be carried out by teams of experts. All published versions of Cochrane systematic reviews and protocols are available from the Cochrane library (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.thecochranelibrary.com">http://www.thecochranelibrary.com</ext-link>). The full-text versions of these can be accessed and downloaded freely (in some high-income and most low-income countries) or at a cost to others.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Each review also has an award winning Plain Language Summary (PLS) section to make it more accessible to people without specialised knowledge,<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> and an abstract, both of which are freely available from the Cochrane PLS website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://summaries.cochrane.org">https://summaries.cochrane.org</ext-link>).</p><p>Twitter is a free to use social media platform that allows users to send a 140-character message called a &#x02018;tweet&#x02019;. These tweets may contain &#x02018;hashtags&#x02019; (#) and/or a Twitter handle (@). # is the means to enable searching for a topic and @ denotes a username for either a person, a company or an entity. Presently, there are 284 million monthly active users sending out 500 million tweets a day. Seventy-seven per cent of accounts are outside the USA and 80% of tweets are sent from mobile devices.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> Over the years, the use of Twitter in healthcare has increased, encompassing issues relating to public health surveillance, tracking disease activity of the H1N1 pandemic and isolating the source of a cholera outbreak in Haiti, among other tweets.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> The promotion of systematic reviews via Twitter, however, is a relatively recent development for most Cochrane Review Groups,<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> despite health-related Twitter messages comprising of a not so insignificant proportion of all Twitter traffic and even predicting geographic regions and trends of illness, based on the tweets.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The year 2011 marked the beginning of the CSzG using various social media platforms and since early 2013, the CSzG invested resources into use of social media as a way of raising awareness of systematic reviews. Twitter, the most active of platforms, is now frequently used by both the group and its followers. The number of followers of the CSzG on Twitter has risen from 296 (in March 2013) to 734 (as of 15 January 2015).</p><p>Although Twitter, Facebook and some other platforms are not available in China, 91% of China's population use social media compared to about 67% of America's.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> The CSzG has been working with a Chinese company, Systematic Review Solutions Ltd,<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> to disseminate parallel messages on Weibo, a Twitter-like system, to their followers, who currently number more than 6000. Weibo is in the top 10 social media sites used in China, with over 600 million registered users, of which about 140 million use it regularly (as of March 2014).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Given the increasing use of social media and, in particular, Twitter, in healthcare, we propose to evaluate the impact of tweeting a pr&#x000e9;cis of CSzG's systematic reviews in a randomised controlled trial in most of the rest of the world and mirroring this in China on Weibo. The impact of this social media dissemination, however, is unclear. As Twitter does not provide data to enable assessment of impact, Google Analytics (GA) is an alternative source of data. GA is easy to use and has a wide range of data accessible with the standard (free) account.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>This trial aims to evaluate the impact of tweeting health-related web links (freely available on summaries.cochrane.org), versus not tweeting, on access to the target webpage and/or related web pages.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Methods and analysis</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design</title><p>Prospective two-arm, parallel, open randomised controlled trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio as outlined below in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="BMJOPEN2015007695F1">figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="BMJOPEN2015007695F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of the study.

This classification was based on data exported from GA on number of views within the pilot period (about 3&#x02005;months) and deciding on a suitable division into categories based on a reasonable definition of high, medium and low &#x02018;popularity&#x02019;, in terms of this data. This categorisation was then checked by CEA and AAM to ensure there was an even number of reviews within each category in order to carry out the pairing. Reviews were given a unique code, which, along with access activity stratum, was supplied to one of the authors (AAM) who performed the randomisation. Stratifying by baseline access activity, and using a computer generated random number sequence, reviews were first allocated to Tweet and non-Tweet arms, then into pairs of reviews that would have the same reference period for outcome data collection, then to day of the week (Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday) and week number (1 to 29) that tweeting would begin for reviews in the intervention arm. Finally, the sequence of the three tweets for each review (the tweet package) in the intervention arm was also randomised.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Interventions</title><sec id="s2c1"><title>Intervention group</title><p>Reviews in the intervention group will be tweeted three times on the same day at 10:30, 13:00 and 15:00 GMT as guided by the SocialBro web tool, since there is some evidence that multiple postings, three to four times a day, of the same or similar tweet, can be useful for an international following.
