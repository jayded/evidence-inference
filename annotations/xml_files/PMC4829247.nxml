Pathophysiologically, the disease is characterized by repetitive partial or complete obstruction of the pharynx during sleep. Despite increasing breathing efforts the upper airway collapse results in episodes of obstructive hypopneas or apneas resulting in negative intrathoracic pressure, intermittent hypoxia, autonomic nervous dysfunction, and consequently adverse effects for sleep-architecture and health.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>A large body of evidence suggests that OSA is associated with cardiac arrhythmias such as paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) with some studies proposing a causal relationship.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Compared with non-OSA patients, severe OSA patients have four times the odds of PAF even after adjustment for potential confounders.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] The underlying mechanisms of heart rhythm disturbances induced by respiratory events is rather complex and represents a challenge in the context of integrative human physiology. Recent studies suggested that the acute effects of obstructive apneas may distend the atria and may change electrophysiology (especially conduction times), ultimately leading to PAF.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Inhomogeneous atrial depolarization secondary to insults such as atrial distension or autonomic nervous dysfunction can be quantified with a surface electrocardiography (ECG)-derived P-wave analysis.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] A high P-wave duration and P-wave dispersion (Pd) have been reported to be a prognostic factor for the onset of PAF.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Moreover, the prolongation of electromechanical delay and an increased Pd are associated with the severity of OSA.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Because treatment of OSA with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) provides a more homogenous conduction (i.e. shorter P-wave durations and less Pd), a causal effect of OSA leading to an increased risk of PAF development is possible.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>Currently, it is unclear whether hypopneas and apneas have an instant effect on P-wave duration and Pd and whether these pathophysiological events might subsequently alter atrial electrophysiology. Thus we aimed to study this important pathophysiological link and investigate the acute effects of simulated OSA on p-wave indices in healthy subjects and patients with PAF.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec006"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the &#x0201c;Cantonal Ethics Committee Zurich&#x0201d;, Switzerland (KEK-ZH-Nr. 2012&#x02013;0310 / EK 1672) and written informed consent was obtained from all participants.</p><sec id="sec007"><title>Study population</title><p>57 patients (24 healthy subjects and 33 patients with PAF) aged between 18 and 75 years were recruited at the study site (University Hospital Zurich, Switzerland). The subjects overlap with two previously published studies and sample size estimation was adopted accordingly.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] In short, these studies investigated the hypothesis whether simulated obstructive apnea could promote arrhythmias e.g. atrial premature or ventricular premature beats. [<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Patients with episodes of AF during the examination, therapy with class III anti-arrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone or dronedarone), severe structural heart disease, history of atrial fibrillation ablation therapy or lung transplantation, mental or physical disability precluding informed consent or compliance with the protocol were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="sec008"><title>Breathing manoeuvres</title><p>The protocol for breathing manoeuvres simulating hypopneas and apneas (and therefore OSA) which was applied in this study has been described previously.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] In short, the following breathing manoeuvres were performed in randomized order for 20s each: (i) inspiration through an inspiratory threshold load device (ITH) to generate a threshold pressure of -20mmHg[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] (Threshold IMT, Respironics, NJ, USA) simulating an hypopnea; (ii) a Mueller manoeuvre (MM) to maintain a target intrathoracic pressure of -30 mmHg[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] simulating an obstructive apnea; (iii) a voluntary end-expiratory central apnea (AP); and (iv) a period of normal breathing which served as baseline (BL). A 60s wash-out phase between the manoeuvres was used to ensure that the P-wave duration and Pd were similar at the beginning of each manoeuvre. For the analysis a standardized time-frame of 50s was recorded for each manoeuvre lasting from -10s until +40 s before and after the onset of the manoeuvre, respectively. This 50 second time-frame was also divided into five 10s sectors in which the effect of the breathing manoeuvres on P-wave duration was assessed separately.</p></sec><sec id="sec009"><title>Electrocardiography</title><p>Digital 12-lead-ECG was recorded continuously in awake 24 healthy subjects and 33 patients with PAF in supine position (AT 104 PC, Schiller-Reomed AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Room temperature and lighting were set at the same level for all measurements and all subjects remained in supine position five minutes before undergoing assessments. The beginning of the P-wave was defined as the point where the first atrial deflection crossed the isoelectric line and the end of the P-wave was defined as the point where the atrial deflection returned to the isoelectric line. The maximum and minimum P-wave durations in all 12 ECG-leads were retrieved and the most extreme ones were used to calculate the Pd (Pd = maximum P-wave duration &#x02212; minimum P-wave duration).[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] For comparisons Pd and P-wave duration was averaged from four heartbeats at the first 10 seconds of the manoeuvre where the biggest change in electrophysiology was expected according to previous studies.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] We explored P-wave duration in a single lead (II or V5) over the 50 second period of each breathing manoeuvre. All ECG recordings were analysed offline by two investigators (TG, AMW) who were blinded to the manoeuvre being performed using dedicated software for ECG-analysis[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] (DatInf Measure 2.1d, DatInf GmbH, Tubingen, Germany).</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Continuous data were summarized as mean&#x000b1;SD and categorical data summarized using percentages. The primary outcomes of this study were the mean P-wave duration and Pd during each breathing manoeuvre. Mixed-effects linear regression with patient-level random-intercepts was used to compare the effect of each breathing manoeuvre on each outcome compared to BL. All analyses were adjusted for manoeuvre, heart rate, BMI, age, sex, and PAF status. An interaction between manoeuvre and PAF status was added to each model to compare the effects of each manoeuvre in patients with and without PAF. Mixed-effects linear regression was also used to assess the effect of each manoeuvre on Pd and P-wave duration measured in a single lead over time by including an interaction between manoeuvre and sector.</p><p>In order to make sure our measurements were reproducible two blinded investigators each measured a total of 180 P-waves from 20 randomly chosen sectors in which all breathing manoeuvres were performed. Inter-observer agreement was assessed using the intra-class-correlation coefficient and a Bland-Altman plot. The validity of Pd (which represents only the two most extreme values) was checked by assessing its correlation with the standard deviation (which takes values from all 12 leads into account) of all corresponding P-wave measurements. A two-sided p-value less than 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant for all tests. All statistical analyses were performed with STATA version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec011"><title>Results</title><p>24 healthy subjects and 33 patients with PAF were included in this study.

This study provides data to better understand the pathophysiological mechanisms that may be involved in patients with OSA and the onset of PAF. The presented data demonstrates how simulated obstructive hypopnea (ITH) and apnea (MM) increases P-wave duration and Pd and thus might have a direct effect on arrhythmogenesis. Our findings that P-wave duration and Pd are increased in patients with PAF are in line with several other studies in literature.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><sec id="sec016"><title>Clinical implications</title><p>The findings of this study may have some important implications for patients at risk for PAF. A large body of evidence suggests that OSA is linked to PAF via mechanisms like elevated blood pressure and intermittent hypoxia among others.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] This study, however, supports evidence that the instant features of OSA directly influence markers of cardiac arrhythmic potential. P-wave duration has been shown to be highly correlated with intra-atrial conduction times.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] It is known that patients with OSA feature a disturbed P-wave morphology and P-wave duration and Pd have been shown to correlate with the apnea-hypopnea index, a marker of disease severity.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Animal models have shown that apneas and hypopneas themselves distend cardiac structures and alter electrophysiology.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] This has been confirmed in several studies conducted in humans.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Pd can be used to assess the individual propensity to PAF onset.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] This study links the pathophysiology of OSA to altered P-wave morphology and shows how the immediate effects of OSA have an impact on P-wave morphology. At this point, the possibility that a significant proportion of the adult population in Western countries may be affected by asymptomatic OSA should be kept in mind. Further research is warranted to assess the long-term relationship between ECG-derived risk markers and the onset of PAF in cohorts with OSA patients. Surface ECG-derived markers represent an elegant and cheap diagnostic tool and it has been advocated to include P-wave indices in automated ECG-reports.</p><p>Recent research suggests that the success rate of PAF treatment (i.e. pulmonary vein isolation) is dependent on the diagnosis of OSA. Meta-analyses have shown that patients with OSA have significantly greater AF recurrence rates after pulmonary vein isolation and CPAP-treatment can reverse this excess risk.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] ECG-derived risk markers might have the potential to accurately predict PAF recurrence after ablation therapy in patients with OSA.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] However, this needs to be proven in future studies focused on this point.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p></sec><sec id="sec017"><title>Potential mechanisms</title><p>Generally the mechanisms leading to the pathogenesis of PAF remain complex and a matter of debate. It is thought that atrial distortion and atrial enlargement are central to the development of PAF.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] In our previous work, we demonstrated that instant negative intrathoracic pressure changes contribute to cardiac dysrhythmias in healthy humans and in patients with PAF.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] Second, acute and chronic dysfunction in the autonomic nervous system associated with OSA lead to cellular mechanisms of myocardial adaptation possibly contributing to PAF.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Autonomic nervous system dysfunction severity (especially sympathetic over-activity) caused by OSA on myocardial depolarization (i.e. QRS duration) is a significant clinical marker in terms of the ventricular arrhythmic risk in OSA patients.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] In fact, data from our study might support a potential autonomic mechanism given that PAF patients (of whom 82% were on beta-blockers) were less susceptible to simulated OSA manoeuvres in Pd and P-wave duration. In addition, augmented oxidative stress has been suggested to increase the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] In our study we could rule out any detrimental effects of instant hypoxia with the AP-manoeuvre, based on previous experience with the manoeuvre[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus the authors hypothesize, that intrathoracic pressure changes and autonomic nervous system dysfunction are important mechanisms in patients with OSA contributing to atrial electrical and structural remodeling, ultimately leading to the onset of PAF.</p><p>According to catheter measurements, approximately 85% of the airway pressure drop is transmitted into the atria.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] The physical effect of atrial stretch paired with autonomic nervous dysfunction several hundred times per night might induce chronic atrial changes resulting in remodeling and functional burden in patients with untreated OSA.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] This mechanism may be modifiable with CPAP-treatment; however this seems not to be the case with oxygen therapy.</p></sec><sec id="sec018"><title>Strengths and limitations</title><p>The use of digital measurements, the high inter-observer agreement between blinded investigators, and the interchangeability between Pd and the SD of the measurements generate high confidence in the validity of the data. Compared with other studies in this field, the present one scores above average in these parametes.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Given the design of this pathophysiological study it is important to emphasize that artificially induced changes in breathing patterns were evaluated which could limit the clinical relevance of the data. However, the physiology of the breathing manoeuvres in our study were validated using esophageal and aortic catheters[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] the authors feel confident that simulated apneas reflect real life conditions and the results can be generalized to patients with OSA.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] Moreover, our team has gathered considerable experience in mimicking real-life conditions for hypopneas and apneas.[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] However, we did not directly measure sympathetic activity which might influence cardiac arrhythmic risk[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and OSA status (i.e. sleep studies) was not assessed in this study. Whether previous exposure to obstructive events might affect the response of apneas on atrial conduction remains to be elucidated. Changes in autonomic nervous system induced by simulated OSA in awake patients might also differ significantly from changes during different sleep stages (e.g. rapid eye movement) which potentially limits the generalizability of the data. Although, we excluded hypoxia (AP) as a potential mechanism in our study[<xref rid="pone.0152994.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], it is very difficult to distinguish the contribution of the role of atrial stretch versus autonomic nervous activity and further research in this area is warranted.</p></sec><sec id="sec019"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion this study provides evidence that breathing manoeuvres simulating obstructive sleep apnea promote an immediate increase of P-wave duration and Pd and provide a potential explanation for the increased risk of PAF in patients with OSA. Our findings imply that intrathoracic pressure swings prolong the intra-atrial conduction time and therefore could be an independent trigger factor for the development for PAF.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec020"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0152994.s001"><label>S1 Appendix</label><caption><title>Inter-observer agreement.</title><p>(PDF)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0152994.s001.pdf"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0152994.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Gaisl</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bratton</surname><given-names>DJ</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kohler</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name> (<year>2015</year>) <article-title>The impact of obstructive sleep apnoea on the aorta</article-title>. <source>Eur Respir J</source>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0152994.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Rossi</surname><given-names>VA</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Stradling</surname><given-names>JR</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Kohler</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name> (<year>2013</year>) <article-title>Effects of obstructive sleep apnoea on heart rhythm</article-title>. <source>Eur Respir J</source>
