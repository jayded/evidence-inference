People with type 2 diabetes mellitus have a high prevalence of obesity, and this finding of weight loss merits closer investigation. The rise in glycated haemoglobin is not consistent with results from animal model studies. We speculate that the deterioration in glucose control may be a signal of inadequate reduction in insulin resistance in humans. Further studies are required to confirm this signal, which will impact on the feasibility of development of this novel class of drugs.</p></list-item></list></sec></boxed-text><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The effect of caloric restriction on energy metabolism has attracted intense interest over the past decade because it prolongs the life span in yeast, nematodes and flies. Caloric restriction also lowers the incidence of age-related disorders such as diabetes and cancer in mammals.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;5</xref> These beneficial effects may be mediated by sirtuins, (&#x02018;SIR-2-ins&#x02019; or <underline>s</underline>ilent mating-type <underline>i</underline>nformation <underline>r</underline>egulation 2). In yeast, the sirtuin gene regulates many cellular pathways including inflammation, apoptosis and mitochondrial biogenesis. The activity of sirtuins is dependent on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , thereby linking energy metabolism and caloric restriction to these important cellular pathways.<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>
</p><p>The mammalian homologue of the sirtuins is SIRT1.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> In murine models, activation of SIRT1 has been implicated in the modulation of several cellular substrates including peroxisome proliferator-activated &#x003b3; cofactor 1-&#x003b1;, nuclear factor &#x003ba;-B, foxhead box protein&#x000a0;and uncoupling proteins.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8&#x02013;10</xref> These pathways are implicated in skeletal muscle energy metabolism&#x000a0;and adipocyte differentiation, and play a role in glucose regulation in skeletal muscle and pancreatic &#x003b2; cells, as well as modulating insulin sensitivity.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Caloric restriction also improves endothelial function in rodent and human studies through weight loss, improvement of nitric oxide production and reduction in reactive-oxygen species.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12&#x02013;14</xref> Inhibition of SIRT1 promotes atherogenesis and upregulation of SIRT1 increases nitric oxide in rodent models.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;17</xref> As a caloric restriction mimetic, SIRT1 activation therefore has the potential to improve cardiovascular health and mitigate the adverse effects of atherosclerotic disease and its risk factors.</p><p>Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent chronic condition, estimated to affect 4.4% of the worldwide population by 2030.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> It is associated with an increasing economic burden and in the USA total costs are estimated to be $245&#x02009;billion.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The major cause of mortality in patients with T2DM is cardiovascular disease. One of the putative mechanisms of the link between cardiovascular disorders and T2DM is endothelial dysfunction.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> Thus, modulation of SIRT1 is a promising strategy for the treatment of both diabetes and its well&#x000a0;documented association with cardiovascular disease.</p><p>To date, studies have primarily investigated the ex vivo effect of SIRT1 activation. We hypothesised that therapeutic SIRT1 activation would have beneficial effects on cardiometabolic health in people with diabetes. Specifically, we examined the effect of a novel SIRT1 activator, SRT2104, on vascular vasomotor and fibrinolytic function, platelet activation, lipid profile and markers of glycaemic control in people with T2DM.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>The study was approved by the research ethics committee, was given clinical trial authorisation by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), and carried out at the MHRA phase&#x000a0;I accredited Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility at the Western General Hospital, UK.

Here we&#x000a0;present the data in patients with T2DM that are broadly consistent with our previously reported observations in otherwise healthy cigarette smokers.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> However, we did note some important contrasts especially in metabolic parameters.</p><p>In otherwise healthy smokers, we have previously found no differences in forearm blood flow, platelet aggregation and fibrinolysis with SRT2104. Our findings in the current T2DM cohort were similar although we found modest reductions in bradykinin-induced vasodilatation and net PAI-1 antigen release with SRT2014. This finding is&#x000a0;unexpected from previous animal models.<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15 17</xref> We did observe some treatment-by-period interactions suggesting the potential for an inadequate washout period. Moreover, our sample size was modest and this could represent a chance finding. An alternative explanation is that SRT2104 affects a hitherto undescribed pathway which works via bradykinin alone and not acetylcholine or sodium nitroprusside. This study cannot answer that question presently but generates a hypothesis for further examination in the future. Once again in contrast to the smokers&#x02019; cohort we found a statistically significant decrease in PAI-antigen release. There was no significant treatment-by-period interaction in this case (p&#x0003e;0.1) which would suggest a potential fibrinolytic benefit in the treatment arm, although this was not confirmed by other measures of t-PA and PAI-1 activity, which were unaltered. Taken in aggregate, the effect of SRT2104 on cardiovascular measures are predominantly neutral although we acknowledge some inconsistent changes in isolated measures of vasomotor and fibrinolytic function.</p><p>Obesity is a major factor in the development of T2DM through the promotion of insulin resistance. Weight reduction is difficult to achieve in many patients and remains a major focus of therapeutic and lifestyle intervention. In the present study a striking reduction in weight over a 28-day period was observed that was not observed with matched placebo. It is unknown whether weight reduction with SRT2104 in overweight patients with T2DM would be sustained and have long-term benefits. Whether it could be attributable to appetite suppression through SIRT1 activation or a consequence of enhanced metabolic effects is unclear, but this is a potentially important observation that warrants further investigation. A treatment-by-period interaction was observed with this result as well, so this result should be interpreted with caution. If sustained and reproducible, this may represent a novel approach to the treatment of obesity.</p><p>The loss of weight was associated with an apparent short-term deterioration in measures of glycaemic control. The elevations of HbA1c and fructosamine were puzzling. These observations contradict the findings in models of mice and other higher mammals. It is possible that the acute administration of SRT2104 mimics the early changes of fasting states (decreased insulin secretion), and that the subsequent effects of decreased insulin sensitivity take longer to develop. This may explain the weight loss that was observed and to a certain extent the lack of benefit to glycaemic control. Supporting this theory, a trend towards decreased peak insulin secretion to a glucose challenge was observed in a separate study (2-hour postglucose challenge insulin concentrations 143 mmol/L&#x000a0;vs 117&#x02009;mmol/L, placebo vs SRT2104, p=0.046) where a similar degree of weight loss (approximately 1&#x02009;kg in 28 days) was observed.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> It may be that in people with T2DM with established relative or absolute insulin deficiency, attenuation of insulin secretion, without a concomitant reduction in insulin resistance, is sufficient to permit a net rise in blood glucose.</p><p>Another potential putative mechanism linking SIRT1 modulation to an acute rise in insulin resistance is the inhibition of Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor&#x000a0; gamma&#x000a0;(PPAR-&#x003b3;) and the mobilisation of fat from white adipose tissue.<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> This may be responsible for the modest rise in non-esterified fatty acids seen after SRT2104 administration that could contribute to the change in glycaemic control, leading to insulin resistance via intracellular competition with glucose metabolism.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>
</p><p>People with T2DM have complex changes to other important glucoregulatory hormones such as glucagon and cortisol.<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> During acute starvation, important metabolic adaptations occur such as gluconeogenesis and an increase in glucocorticoids. These metabolic adaptations maintain the supply of blood glucose to the brain during periods of prolonged starvation, but result acutely in a constellation of effects similar to insulin resistance. However, in people with established T2DM, these protective glucoregulatory mechanisms described above may exacerbate hyperglycaemia in the short term.</p><p>Without further study, it is unclear whether long-term exposure to SRT2104 will ultimately be metabolically beneficial in patients with T2DM. The promotion of hyperglycaemia, which is undesirable, conflicts with the beneficial effects of weight loss, and it is unknown whether these effects are sustained over time. The finding of weight loss certainly raises the question as to whether the drug might be beneficial in individuals with impaired fasting glucose who are treatment-naive, and whether an exposure to the drug beyond 28 days would improve glycaemia once the downstream effects of increased mitochondrial activity and decreased adiposity are further established.</p><p>The principal aim of the present study was to establish whether SRT2014 could improve a range of markers of cardiovascular health in patients with T2DM. Ultimately, we did not demonstrate any improvements in vasomotor or fibrinolytic vascular function or measures of platelet and monocyte activation.</p><p>An important question was whether the dose of SRT2104 was sufficient to have an effect. As yet, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of SRT2104 are not fully elucidated. However, an effect on metabolic measures was demonstrated with substantial exposure to SRT2104, achieving high plasma SRT2104 concentrations in the current study. Even if adequate SIRT1 activation is assumed, its downstream effects may vary in different tissues in different disease states. It may be that in advanced states of disease associated with ageing, such as T2DM, the beneficial effects are abolished by higher caloric consumption, or that the benefits require treatment for longer than 28 days to become apparent. It might therefore be anticipated that a more prolonged exposure is required before any meaningful effect is apparent.</p><p>In conclusion, SRT2104 appears to be well tolerated in patients with T2DM but has no demonstrable beneficial effects on a range of measures of cardiovascular health. It is possible that while short-term exposure to SRT2104 is effective in mediating weight loss, it appears to be associated with an inadequate effect on diminishing insulin resistance, thereby causing deterioration in glycaemic control. Further larger-scale studies are required to confirm or refute these preliminary findings.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the staff of the Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility in Edinburgh for their help with this study.
