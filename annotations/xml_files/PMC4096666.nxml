A recent study speculated that anesthesia induction using propofol 2 mg/kg transiently reduced left ventricular (LV) contraction by analyzing tissue Doppler-derived imaging (TDI) during induction phase. The purpose of this study was to analyze and to compare the impacts of propofol- and thiopental-induction on LV function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty-four female patients with normal LV function undergoing non-cardiac surgery were randomly administered intravenous bolus thiopental (5 mg/kg, Thiopental-group, n = 12) or propofol (2 mg/kg, Propofol-group, n = 12) for anesthesia-induction. TDI of septal mitral annular velocity during systole (S'), early diastole (e') and atrial contraction (a') were determined by transthoracic echocardiography before and 1, 3, and 5 minutes after thiopental/propofol administration (T0, T1, T2, and T3, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The bispectral index and systolic blood pressure declined significantly during anesthesia induction in both groups, however, more depressed in Thiopental-group compared with those in Propofol-group at T2 and T3 (all, <italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Among TDI two parameters demonstrated a significant inter-group difference: the S' in propofol was lower than that in Thiopental-group at T3 (<italic>p</italic> = 0.002), and a' velocities were persistently lower in Propofol-group, compared with same time values in Thiopental-group (T1, T2, and T3: <italic>p</italic> = 0.025, 0.007, and 0.009, respectively).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Anesthesia induction using propofol revealed a more persistent and profound decline of LV and atrial contraction than that using thiopental. Further studies are needed to understand the clinical implication.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Intraoperative</kwd><kwd>Echocardiography</kwd><kwd>Doppler</kwd><kwd>Thiopental</kwd><kwd>Propofol</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source country="KR">Korean Society of Echocardiography</funding-source></award-group></funding-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Evaluating and avoiding perioperative risk factors compromising myocardial performance is important to enhance postoperative outcomes and reduce perioperative morbidity and mortality in adult non-cardiac surgery.<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref> For preoperative risk evaluation, traditionally the revised cardiac risk index<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref> and American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association guidelines<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5)</xref> are applied. Unfortunately, the traditional predictive tools do not integrate purely anesthesia-related factors for routine surgeries, presumably in the belief that the sophistication of modern anesthesia practice renders it devoid of relevant risks in such cases.</p><p>Anesthesia induction is commonly initiated by an intravenous (IV) administration of hypnotics, such as thiopental or propofol, for abruptly bringing wakeful patients into unresponsiveness to strong adrenergic stimuli, including tracheal intubation and surgical procedures. However, hemodynamic instability in various degrees is commonly associated during the anesthesia induction phase using these hypnotics: 9% of patients experienced severe hypotension during and after anesthesia induction in clinical practice.<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6)</xref> As hypotension often occurs after IV thiopental and propofol, in patients with left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, etomidate is sometimes preferred as an alternative.<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7)</xref></p><p>Unfortunately, even though LV systolic function is one risk factor for anesthesia induction events, and it is well known that induction has significant hemodynamic and cardiac effects, the kind and magnitude to the effects on LV myocardium function of anesthesia induction, including the particular agents used, have not been thoroughly studied. This may be due to the routineness and apparent harmlessness of the effects as observed casually and also a lack of monitoring tools and procedures.</p><p>Doppler tissue imaging (DTI) non-invasively assesses myocardial tissue motion to evaluate both systolic and diastolic myocardial function with the advantage of less load-dependence than conventional flow pulsed wave (PW) Doppler techniques.<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8)</xref> Intraoperative tissue Doppler monitoring during anesthesia induction can be helpful to provide immediate insight into hemodynamic changes, giving an idea of loading conditions as well as myocardial performance during this vulnerable phase.

Patients with any of the following conditions were excluded in the operation room: unfavorable airway or facemask fit, intractable coughing, hiccups, or hypotension [mean blood pressure (BP) &#x0003c; 60 mmHg] requiring IV positive inotrope or vasoconstrictors during the study period.</p></sec><sec><title>Anesthesia induction</title><p>Pre-medication accorded with our routine practice: 10 mL/kg/hour of Ringer's lactate solution, a balanced crystalloid solution (Plasma Solution-A&#x02122;, CJ Bio and Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea), 0.2 mg of glycopyrrolate, and 0.03 mg/kg of midazolam. Once in the operation room, we started to monitor electrocardiography, non-invasive BP, heart rate (HR), pulse oximeter oxygen saturation, and the bispectral index (BIS). To begin anesthesia induction, patients spontaneously inhaled oxygen (8 L/min) through a transparent facemask and a breathing circuit with a reservoir bag. Either bolus thiopental (5.0 mg/kg) (Pentotal&#x02122; sodium, JW Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea; Thiopental group) or propofol (2.0 mg/kg) (Pofol&#x02122;, Dongkuk Pharmaceutical, Seoul, Korea; Propofol group) was administered intravenously for 10 seconds, after which assisted and controlled ventilation followed. After 5 minutes, complete induction was confirmed via a lack of train-of-four response and followed by tracheal intubation for maintenance anesthesia.</p></sec><sec><title>Intraoperative transthoracic echocardiography</title><p>After positioning the patient supine on the operation table, serial transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), two-dimensional imaging of the apical 4-chamber view and PW Doppler imaging of mitral inflow, was performed with a portable GE Vivid Q platform (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI, USA), before (T0) and 1, 3, and 5 minutes after the thiopental bolus injection (T1, T2, and T3, respectively) along with hemodynamic recordings at the same times (BP, HR, and BIS). DTI was recorded at the septal mitral annulus from the apical 4-chamber view to determine longitudinal annular velocities with a sweep of 66.7 mm/s. Each set of images required less than 30 seconds.</p><p>The LV ejection fraction was determined from the 2-dimensional apical 4-chamber imaging by the modified Simpson's method. The early diastolic velocity (E), late atrial filling velocity (A), and a deceleration time of E were assessed from the mitral inflow PW Doppler imaging. Tissue Doppler-derived indices of systolic (S'), early diastolic (e'), and late diastolic (a') velocities were measured from mitral septal annular DTI from an average 3 beats.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size estimation was based on the previous prospective studies: Gauss et al.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> (n = 10 for propofol; n = 10 for etomidate; n = 10 for thiopental), Mulier et al.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref> (n = 10 for each group), and Wodey et al.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14)</xref> (n = 10 for thiopental; n = 10 for propofol), taking potential drop-outs during the measurement (20%) due to insufficient echocardiographic window into account.</p><p>Demographic data were presented as median values (interquartile range) or number of patients. Continuous variables were expressed as mean (standard deviation) or median (interquartile range). For comparison of demographic data between groups, the Mann-Whitney test was used. For statistical comparisons of serial changes within a group, the Friedman test with multiple comparisons was applied. For comparison of cardiovascular data between thiopental and propofol group, the Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test was used.

Mulier et al.<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13)</xref> concluded that the cardio-depressant effects of propofol are more pronounced and more prolonged than those of equipotent doses of thiopental when given as a single bolus, by measuring LV volume using intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography. Wodey et al.<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14)</xref> demonstrated that myocardial contractility decreased significantly 5 minutes after induction with both thiopental and propofol in infants, measuring LV diameters using TTE. These previous clinical studies<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14)</xref> provided reasonable concepts of myocardial depressive effects of induction anesthesia. However, their evaluation tool of M-mode dimension or volume, and fractional shortening would not sufficiently monitor (give an idea from beat to beat) live in this short induction period. In this study, we adopted live monitoring of intraoperative transthoracic DTI to evaluate the impact of IV anesthesia induction on myocardial performance. Intraoperative transthoracic DTI evaluation seems promising to provide immediate insight into hemodynamic changes as well as myocardial performance.</p><p>Regarding systolic function, in this study, the LV ejection fraction was temporarily decreased at T1 and T2 compared with T0, in thiopental; there were no significant changes in propofol. These results are similar to the aforementioned study by Gauss et al.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> on fractional shortening.<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12)</xref> However, even though there was a statistically significant decrease of LV ejection in the thiopental group, the clinical significance of the roughly 5% decrease may in itself be low. The present study is somewhat unique in directly monitoring S' by DTI to compare systolic function between two commonly used induction anesthesia. In both anesthesia inductions, S' significantly decreased from T0 within a group; however, at T3, the thiopental group tended to recover. Therefore, the between group difference was significant [6.50 (6.14-6.93) vs. 5.65 (4.80-5.90) cm/s, <italic>p</italic> = 0.002]. It may support the previous findings<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15)</xref> that with a clinical dosage of thiopental and propofol, thiopental has a shorter onset time and shorter depressive effect on myocardium during the induction period. The clinical impact of such a degree of decline of S' has not been tested.</p><p>A more interesting finding was between-group differences on diastolic function. The early relaxation velocities (e') declined consistently in both groups; the impact on atrial contraction (a') was significantly different between groups. There was a significant decrease of a' with propofol but not with thiopental (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Therefore, we can speculate that thiopental may compromise atrial contraction less. Further studies are needed to discern the precise clinical impact.</p><p>This study has several limitations. First, it reflects only a single center with a relatively small and strictly female population. Non-parametric analysis would overcome the small sample size. Performing studies in gynecologic surgery is limited to the female population, further study could include either gender or higher-risk patients. Second, for reasons of practicality, it did not measure sophisticated indices of preload or afterload. To include all the desired parameters may require more time, and turn to non-continuous monitoring as a point of single parameter-likely therefore, missing closely-timed variations. Therefore, in this study we focused on clinically applicable DTI parameters, which seem relatively less load-dependent and easy to perform. Third, even though we limited parameters to those with DTI, the measuring was not completely continuous manner since that would require multiple simultaneous Doppler scanners.</p><p>Furthermore, this study was an observational, non-interventional design, to see changes of tissue Doppler-derived indices during routine clinical practice using either IV anesthesia induction agent. Considering that BIS decreased more profoundly and persistently with propofol than thiopental (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.001); further studies may be warranted controlling for BIS level to determine BIS-independent effects of the induction agents on cardiac function. Future studies would also usefully expand to include other clinical populations.</p><p>In conclusion, using intraoperative transthoracic DTI imaging, we examined impacts on cardiac function from the two most commonly applied IV anesthesia induction agents, thiopental and propofol-the propofol-based anesthesia group revealed a more persistent and profound decline of S' and a' velocities than the thiopental-based group. This suggests a specific drug-dependent impact on myocardial performance during the anesthesia induction. Further studies are warranted to understand the clinical implications--these may affect the choice of induction anesthesia agent during pre-operative patient evaluation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by an Industry-Academy grant of the Korean Society of Echocardiography (2012, Yang
