In addition, serum phosphate concentration within the upper limits of normal is associated with a greater prevalence of vascular and valvular calcification in patients with moderate chronic kidney disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. In the last years, our research group performed human studies involving calcium phosphate supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Most studies with calcium phosphate focus on the beneficial effects relating to intestinal metabolism, e.g. bile acid metabolism, fatty acid excretion, and modulation of the microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. This is because amorphous calcium phosphate is formed in the human gut and, moreover, is able to precipitate intestinal substances, such as bile or fatty acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]. However, calcium phosphate is poorly absorbed in the gut. Evidence comes from studies showing unchanged fasting plasma concentrations of calcium and phosphate after calcium phosphate supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Nevertheless, measuring fasting concentrations is not a convincing method to examine the influence of calcium phosphate supplementation on calcium and phosphate status. Furthermore, Heaney <italic>et al</italic>. showed that solubility of a calcium supplement has very little influence on its absorbability and that absorption of calcium from food sources is determined mainly by other food components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. In addition, it is necessary to test every calcium product for absorbability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Therefore, in this human study, we examined the postprandial calcium and phosphate concentrations after calcium phosphate supplementation of both a single dose and after three weeks.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Supplement</title><p>For purposes of supplementation, we used pentacalcium hydroxy-triphosphate (Ca<sub>5</sub>(PO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>3</sub>OH; cfb; Budenheim Germany; CaP) in this study. CaP was incorporated in whole wheat bread to achieve an additional calcium intake of 1&#x000a0;g/d (0.5&#x000a0;g phosphorus/d). Participants consumed approximately 135&#x000a0;g of this bread daily. Placebo bread was prepared in exactly the same way, but without the CaP supplement.</p></sec><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>The study was conducted between July and September 2010 in the Institute of Nutrition, Department of Nutritional Physiology at the Friedrich Schiller University Jena. Ten omnivorous men participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Eligibility criteria for participants included age between 20 and 35&#x000a0;years and good physical health. A further criterion was that participants remain at the blood withdrawal centre for at least 5&#x000a0;hours between 7.30&#x000a0;am till 12.30&#x000a0;pm. Volunteers were provided with detailed information regarding purpose, course, and possible risks involved in the study. All participants gave their written informed consent. The study protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Friedrich Schiller University, Jena (No.:2833-05/10). Of the initial ten volunteers, one participant dropped out due to personal reasons. The main study outcomes comprised blood concentrations of calcium and phosphate (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p><bold>Study flowchart.</bold> CaP: pentacalcium hydroxy-triphosphate.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2891-12-30-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Study design</title><p>Participants were divided into two groups. For a period of three weeks, one group consumed bread containing CaP whereas the other group consumed the placebo product. This was followed by a two-week wash-out phase. Thereafter, the intervention changed between the two groups for a further three weeks. Thus, the study design allowed that every participant was his own control. The intervention periods are divided in two parts. At the beginning the participants ate the test bread with or without CaP onetime and then blood was taken (single administration). Afterwards the participants consumed the test bread three weeks daily and then blood was taken again (repeated administration). Consequently, the study involved four types of administrations: single CaP administration, single placebo administration, repeated CaP administration and repeated placebo administration. In addition, participants consumed a defined diet for three days before each blood sample was taken (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>).</p><fig id="F2" position="float"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p><bold>Design of the double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study.</bold> wk: week; CaP: pentacalcium hydroxy-triphosphate; blood: blood sampling at time points 0, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240&#x000a0;minutes; between 0 and 30&#x000a0;minutes, the participants consumed a test meal with or without CaP; DD: defined diet for three days before blood sampling.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1475-2891-12-30-2"/></fig><p>The defined diet containing the complete food supply for three days was prepared and pre-weighed in the study centre.

Although, there are some studies in the literature in which the calcium concentration was determined following a short time interval after calcium intake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. For instance, Heaney <italic>et al.</italic> compared the bioavailability of calcium from two fortification systems. A combination of tricalcium phosphate and calcium lactate (500&#x000a0;mg calcium, orange juice) led to an increase in serum calcium of almost 0.35&#x000a0;mg/dl (0.09&#x000a0;mmol/l) after two hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. In the study of Green <italic>et al.</italic>, the change in the calcium concentration after tricalcium phosphate (1200&#x000a0;mg calcium, powder mixed in water) was 0.1&#x000a0;mmol/l [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. In present study, plasma calcium concentration rose by approximately 0.06&#x000a0;mmol/l in four hours after single administration and by about 0.1&#x000a0;mmol/l after repeated administration. The significantly higher calcium concentration at 240&#x000a0;min after single and repeated CaP administration and the significantly higher AUC for the increment in calcium concentration after repeated CaP administration compared to placebo suggest that part of the calcium from the CaP supplement was absorbed. Supplementation with CaP led to an increase in blood calcium concentration, which is comparable to other studies.</p><p>Because hyperphosphatemia is linked with vascular calcification, cardiovascular mortality, and progression of chronic kidney disease, phosphate intake is an aspect that is controversially discussed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. In the present study, there was no difference in the plasma phosphate concentration between CaP and placebo after 240&#x000a0;min. In another study by Reginster <italic>et al.</italic> comprising 10 male subjects, the serum phosphorus concentration did not change after supplementation with tricalcium phosphate (1000&#x000a0;mg Ca) within a time frame of 360&#x000a0;min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. In contrast, both Yang <italic>et al.</italic> and Shires <italic>et al.</italic> showed an increase in phosphorus concentration after an intake of 1200&#x000a0;mg calcium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Interestingly, after all administrations (single CaP and placebo administration, repeated CaP and placebo administrations), phosphate concentration significantly decreased at first, followed by a rise to basal concentration (Figure&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). Karp <italic>et al.</italic> showed similar results for plasma phosphate concentration after supplementation with different calcium supplements and potassium citrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Because of a decrease in bone resorption, the authors assumed a decrease in the release of phosphate from bone for potassium citrate only [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Moreover, hypophosphatemia can be a result of phosphate shifts from the blood into the cells, such as after ingestion of glucose, fructose, and feeding following starvation (phosphorylation processes) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. A glucose load can induce a transient reduction in serum phosphate levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>], probably due to secretion of gastrointestinal hormones and subsequent stimulation of calcitonin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. Calcitonin induces an inhibition of osteoclasts and a reduction in the release of phosphorus from bone into blood. However, the association between gastrointestinal hormones and calcitonin has only been shown in rodents and not in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>Alternatively, the decreasing concentration of phosphate in the present study can also be explained by a dilution effect as participants were allowed to drink water <italic>ad libitum</italic> after the test meal. Between time points 60&#x02013;120&#x000a0;min, the phosphate concentration increased again to baseline levels indicating that intestinal phosphate absorption took place within this time frame. Indeed, in the study by Karp <italic>et al</italic>., the participants were also allowed to drink water <italic>ad libitum</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. In contrast, studies in which liquid intake were restricted showed either an immediate increase or a constant phosphate concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>Hence, the present results indicate that the increased phosphate intake due to the CaP supplementation, did probably not lead to an increased phosphate absorption in the gut. This conclusion is supported by comparably postprandial phosphate concentrations and the similar AUC for the increment in phosphate concentration after CaP and placebo administrations. In order to confirm these results, isotopic tracer studies are indicated. However, the results show that phosphate from this CaP supplement did not lead to an increase in plasma phosphate concentration.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, our results show that CaP contributes to an adequate calcium supply, but without increasing the plasma concentration of phosphate.
