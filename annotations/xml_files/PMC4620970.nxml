As the angiogenic factor vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) regulates osteoclast activity and is associated with more extensive bone metastases and SRE risk in metastatic breast cancer, we hypothesized that blockade of VEGF signaling could be a therapeutic strategy for inhibiting bone metastases progression and possibly prolonging overall (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS). The Zamboney trial was a randomized placebo-controlled study designed to assess whether patients with bone predominant metastatic breast cancer benefited from addition of the VEGF receptor (VEGFR) targeting agent, vandetanib, to endocrine therapy with fulvestrant. As a companion study, evaluation of biomarkers and their potential association with response to vandetanib or SRE risk was performed.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Baseline overnight fasted serum from enrolled patients was analyzed for levels of various putative biomarkers including; VEGF-A, soluble (s)VEGFR2, sVEGFR3, transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2;1 and activinA by ELISA. Spearman correlation coefficients and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to investigate potential relationships between biomarker values and baseline clinical parameters. Prognostic and predictive ability of each marker was investigated using Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustments for treatment and baseline strata of serum CTx (&#x0003c;400 versus &#x02265;400&#x000a0;ng/L).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Of 129 enrolled patients, serum was available for analysis in 101; 51 in vandetanib and 50 in placebo arm. Mean age amongst consenting patients was 59.8 years. Clinical characteristics were not significantly different between patients with or without serum biomarker data and serum markers were similar for patients by treatment arm. Baseline sVEGFR2 was prognostic for OS (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.61&#x02013;0.96, <italic>p</italic>=0.020), and although a modest association was observed, it was not significant for PFS (HR=0.90, 95% CI=0.80&#x02013;1.01, <italic>p</italic>=0.085) nor time to first SRE (HR=0.82, 95% CI=0.66&#x02013;1.02, <italic>p</italic>=0.079). When interaction terms were evaluated, sVEGFR2 was not found to be predictive of response to vandetanib, although a modest association remained with respect to PFS (interaction <italic>p</italic>=0.085). No other marker showed any significant prognostic or predictive ability with any measured outcome.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this clinical trial, sVEGFR2 appeared prognostic for OS, hence validation of sVEGFR2 should be conducted.

Bone metastases are also associated with significant pain, reduced quality of life and skeletal related events (SREs), such as radiotherapy or surgery to the bone, pathological fractures, spinal cord compression, or hypercalcaemia <xref rid="bib3" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>, <xref rid="bib4" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. Bone metastases from breast cancer are commonly treated with agents that block bone turnover, such as bisphosphonates or the antibody to the Receptor Activator NF-KB ligand (RANKL), denosumab <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib6" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="bib7" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="bib8" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>. However, despite statistically significant reductions in SREs with bone-targeted agents, the absolute benefits are modest with no consistent progression free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) benefit <xref rid="bib5" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="bib9" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>, <xref rid="bib10" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>. The ability to identify new treatment combinations that prolong survival for patients with bone metastatic breast cancer as well as to identify novel biomarkers of absolute benefits from the use of both bone-targeted therapies and novel anti-cancer agents would be exceedingly valuable.</p><p>In the context of breast cancer bone metastases, VEGF can act as an osteolytic factor in the presence of RANKL, further promoting osteoclast maturation and activation <xref rid="bib11" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>, <xref rid="bib12" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>. Increased VEGF serum levels are associated with more extensive bone metastases and reductions in serum VEGF levels in these patients have been shown to correlate with response to bisphosphonates <xref rid="bib13" ref-type="bibr">[13]</xref>, <xref rid="bib14" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>. As such, the Zamboney study was designed to assess whether patients with bone predominant metastatic breast cancer could benefit from the addition of the targeted agent vandetanib to standard endocrine therapy with fulvestrant. Vandetanib (aka ZACTIMA or AZD6474) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor predominantly targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-2, the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and the REarranged during Transfection (RET) kinase. The primary results are reported elsewhere <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, but briefly, the addition of vandetanib to fulvestrant was not shown to enhance PFS, OS or tumor response as measured by circulating levels of urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, a statistically non-significant trend was observed of a differential treatment effect based on baseline uNTx, suggesting the possibility of a predictive effect. Specifically, no difference in OS or PFS was observed between vandetanib and placebo treated patients who had normal baseline NTx, however, amongst patients with abnormal NTx (i.e. &#x0003e;65&#x000a0;nM BCE/mmol Creatine), those who received vandetanib had improved PFS and OS. A test for interaction was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.028) with PFS, but not for OS (<italic>p</italic>=0.25). Hence, we performed additional biomarker analyzes in order to investigate the possibility of whether particular subgroups of patients derived greater benefit from vandetanib.</p><p>To date, no biomarker analyses of response to VEGFR targeting agents in breast cancer patients with bone predominant metastatic disease has occurred. Although the bone turnover markers serum c-telopeptide (sCTx), and urinary N-telopeptide (uNTx) were measured at baseline, and uNTX measured every 8 weeks on patients accrued to the Zamboney study, no statistically significant association of these markers with response to vandetanib were observed in the main Zamboney study. Circulating angiogenic factors such as VEGF, bFGF, SDF-1&#x003b1; or soluble (s)VEGFR2 or sVEGFR3 have been previously suggested to associate with response following administration of the VEGF/VEGFR targeting agents bevacizumab, sunitinib (SU11248), BAY 57-9352, vatalinib (PTK787/ZK222584) and cediranib (AZD2171) <xref rid="bib16" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>, <xref rid="bib17" ref-type="bibr">[17]</xref>, <xref rid="bib18" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>, <xref rid="bib19" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="bib20" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>, <xref rid="bib21" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, <xref rid="bib22" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. Thus, we measured markers of tumor angiogenesis previously suggested to associate with response to VEGF-targeting drugs, namely VEGF, sVEGFR2 or sVEGFR3, and additionally evaluated putative markers of bone metastasis burden, namely transforming growth factor (TGF)-&#x003b2; and its related family member activinA, at baseline in patients enrolled in Zamboney to assess their prognostic or predictive abilities.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0015"><label>2.1</label><title>Study population</title><p>Post-menopausal women with estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PR) positive breast cancer and radiologically confirmed bone only or bone predominant metastases were eligible for enrolment in Zamboney <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. Eligible patients providing signed informed consent were randomized 1:1 to receive vandetanib (100&#x000a0;mg/day) or placebo together with fulvestrant (500&#x000a0;mg IM on days 1, 15, 29 and then every 28 days thereafter) following stratification based on baseline fasting levels of serum CTx (&#x0003c;400&#x000a0;ng/L, or &#x02265;400&#x000a0;ng/L) measured as described <xref rid="bib15" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>.

Other outcomes measured included PFS, defined as the time from randomization until disease progression (as defined by RECIST <xref rid="bib23" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref>) or death, OS, calculated from the date of randomization to date of death by any cause, and time to first on-study SRE. As part of the main study consent, patients could also optionally consent to the collection of urine and serum samples for future research. Use of these materials in the current study was approved by the Ottawa Health Science Research Ethics Board.</p></sec><sec id="s0020"><label>2.2</label><title>Biochemical analysis</title><p>For the present analysis, serum obtained at baseline study screening was obtained within 21 days of initiation of study drug. Blood was drawn in the morning following an overnight fast and samples were allowed to clot and subsequently centrifuged at 4&#x000b0;C for 10&#x000a0;min at 3400&#x000a0;RPM. Serum was frozen at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analysis. Alternative biomarkers were measured using specific enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA) kits in baseline serum samples for VEGF-A (Quantikine, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis MN, detection limit 9&#x000a0;pg/ml), sVEGFR2 (Quantikine, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis MN, detection limit 12&#x000a0;pg/ml), and TGF-&#x003b2;1 (Quantikine, R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis MN, detection limit 16&#x000a0;pg/ml.) For sVEGFR3 or activinA, human antibody Duosets (R&#x00026;D Systems, Minneapolis MN) were used to generate sandwich ELISAs according to the manufacturer's directions. The capture antibodies were diluted in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) and used to coat the wells of immunoplates (Cat # 439454, Nalge Nunc International, Rochester NY) overnight at room temperature. Coated plates were washed and blocked with 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS prior to addition of serum samples. Biotinylated detection antibodies and horse radish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated streptavidin were subsequently added, and HRP colorimetric substrate (1:1 mixture of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and tetramethylbenzidine) development was assessed by absorbance at 450&#x000a0;nm. The threshold of sensitivity for ELISAs performed in this manner was 20&#x000a0;pg/ml for sVEGFR3 and 250&#x000a0;pg/ml for activinA. For all ELISA analyses, each serum sample was assessed in duplicate, and the concentration of each biomarker protein was determined by comparison to internally generated standard curves using recombinant protein. When levels of measured proteins exceeded that of the standard curve estimate, samples were appropriately diluted until absorbance measures fell within those of the standard curve to reliably estimate the concentration. Patients with levels below the threshold of sensitivity of the assay were assigned a value of 0&#x000a0;pg/ml for statistical analyses. Investigators performing the laboratory analyses were blinded to treatment arm, to the timing of the serum sample, and clinical outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s0025"><label>2.3</label><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Exploratory statistical analyses were used to compare baseline demographic and disease characteristics between those eligible for biomarker analysis versus ineligible using Fisher's exact tests, <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests as appropriate. Similar analyses were performed to compare baseline biomarker levels between treatment arms amongst women who consented to the biomarker sub-study. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to evaluate the relationship between biomarker values and selected baseline clinical characteristics and other biomarkers. The concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) was used to measure the reproducibility of biomarker levels. The CCC is a measure which not only measures the degree of association between values, but also whether the measures lie on the line of unity. The prognostic ability of each biomarker on PFS, OS and time-to-first SRE was evaluated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Initially, all biomarkers were assessed in univariable analysis, and then secondarily after adjusting for treatment arm and stratum (serum CTx &#x0003c;400&#x000a0;ng/L versus &#x02265;400&#x000a0;ng/L). Lastly the predictive value of each biomarker was evaluated by investigating the potential interaction between each biomarker and treatment. As the estimated hazards ratio of an interaction is difficult to interpret, only the <italic>p</italic>-value is presented for simplicity. All tests were two-sided and a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.05 or less was considered statistically significant, while a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.1 to 0.05 was considered as trending towards significance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0030"><label>3</label><title>Results</title><sec id="s0035"><label>3.1</label><title>Baseline characteristics</title><p>Of the 129 women enrolled in Zamboney, 101 had samples available for analysis in the current study.

In this subgroup of patients, higher baseline sVEGFR2 was statistically significant as a prognostic marker of improved OS, with trends towards significance as a prognostic marker for improved PFS and time to first SRE. sVEGFR2 has been shown to be prognostic in a number of other cancer types <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Our findings are similar to those recently reported from the AVADO trial which randomized HER2-negative locally recurrent and metastatic breast cancer patients to receive docetaxel with the anti-angiogenic agent bevacizumab <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>. In this study, higher plasma concentrations of sVEGFR2 were associated with better PFS response (HR=0.46, 95% C.I. (0.28&#x02013;0.74), <italic>p</italic>=0.03) in bevacizumab treated patients compared to placebo; association of sVEGFR2 with OS was not reported. In contrast, low baseline sVEGFR2 levels were associated with longer PFS for patients on cediranib in hepatocellular carcinoma <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>, and with greater benefit from cediranib treatment in colorectal cancer patients <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. Median biomarker levels used to determine associations in these studies are similar to that used in our study (median sVEGFR2 of 5.9&#x000a0;ng/ml <xref rid="bib24" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> in the hepatocellular carcinoma study and 11.6&#x000a0;ng/ml in the colorectal cancer study <xref rid="bib25" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> compared to 8&#x000a0;ng/ml in our study). However, as neither hepatocellular nor colorectal cancers commonly metastasize to bone while it is the predominant site of breast cancer metastases, it is perhaps not surprising that different associations are observed and the role of sVEGFR2 in progression of metastatic breast cancer remains unclear. It should also be noted that vandetanib targets alternative kinases compared to cediranib which primarily targets VEGFR1, 2 and 3, which may also contribute to the different observations in sVEGFR2 associations.</p><p>The role of sVEGFR2 in specifically regulating bone metastases is not well established. The VEGF ligand plays an important role in establishment of a vascular bed in the bone in addition to promoting survival and differentiation of resident bone cells <xref rid="bib27" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref>. Cell surface expression of VEGFR2 has been shown to increase during osteoclast differentiation from mononuclear precursor cells where it is the predominant receptor mediating VEGF signaling in osteoclasts <xref rid="bib28" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="bib29" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>. As one of the prime mediators of bone destruction in metastatic breast cancer, it is likely that patients with high circulating sVEGFR2 may have reduced osteoclastogenic activity as a result of binding and sequestration of VEGF ligand from cell surface receptors on osteoclasts. As patients with increased osteolytic activity and bone turnover tend to have worse prognosis <xref rid="bib30" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>, higher levels of sVEGFR2 may inhibit VEGF-induced osteoclastogenic activity and osteolysis and hence contribute to better survival outcomes in bone metastatic breast cancer patients.</p><p>The finding that baseline VEGF in the Zamboney study was not associated with clinical outcomes are in contrast to other published studies. VEGF was previously shown to be associated with better treatment outcomes in metastatic breast cancer patients treated with bevacizumab <xref rid="bib26" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>, <xref rid="bib31" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref>. This discrepancy may be due to the fact that 100% of patients enrolled in Zamboney had bone predominant metastases, while only ~60&#x02013;70% of patients enrolled in the AVADO or AVEREL studies had metastases to bone. Alternatively, bevacizumab, which was used in the AVADO and AVERAL studies, is an antibody based therapeutic that binds VEGF ligands directly, while vandetanib is a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets the VEGFR2 receptor along with other kinases. Also, as approximately 79% of Zamboney patients were either previously or concurrently treated with bisphosphonates at the time of study entry, this may further confound results, as bisphosphonate administration can result in decreased VEGF levels in patients <xref rid="bib32" ref-type="bibr">[32]</xref>. The majority of Zamboney patients were also previously treated with either tamoxifen, which causes platelet release of VEGF, or aromatase inhibitors which have no effect on VEGF release <xref rid="bib33" ref-type="bibr">[33]</xref>. This could also confound the results for VEGF levels obtained in serum at baseline study entry depending on whether patients were given tamoxifen versus aromatase inhibitors. The lack of association of the alternative measured bone biomarkers TGF-&#x003b2; or activinA with clinical outcome is supported by our recent findings in similar patient cohorts in other studies <xref rid="bib34" ref-type="bibr">[34]</xref>, <xref rid="bib35" ref-type="bibr">[35]</xref>. It is important to note that many of the putative predictive and pharmacodynamic markers used to assess response to anti-angiogenic therapies are differentially affected by concurrent treatments, and as such great care should be taken to consider these variables when performing such biomarker measures.</p><p>The current sub-study is purely exploratory in nature and the current biomarker hypotheses were not pre-specified, nor was the study powered to detect significant differences in biomarkers or their associations. As such these results should be considered hypothesis generating. Our sample sizes are also relatively small, and due to study design, we were limited to measuring circulating biomarker levels at baseline. Further, over 20% of study patients declined participation in the correlative sub-study. Many studies have suggested that changes in biomarkers from baseline to on treatment are more predictive of treatment response <xref rid="bib36" ref-type="bibr">[36]</xref>, <xref rid="bib37" ref-type="bibr">[37]</xref>, <xref rid="bib38" ref-type="bibr">[38]</xref>, <xref rid="bib39" ref-type="bibr">[39]</xref>. In the current sub-study we were unable to interrogate this question, however given the possible association of sVEGFR2 with clinical outcome in bone metastatic breast cancer patients treated with an anti-angiogenic agent, changes in sVEGFR2 levels from baseline to on treatment should be evaluated in bone metastatic breast cancer patients in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s0055"><label>5</label><title>Conclusions</title><p>In this hypothesis-generating study, sVEGFR2 was identified as a potentially important candidate biomarker for assessing clinical outcome in bone predominant metastatic breast cancer patients. Given the lack of supporting information regarding its role in the bone metastatic microenvironment, studies to determine its effect on bone metastasis progression and to validate its use as a biomarker of clinical response are warranted.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="bib1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Diel</surname><given-names>I.J.</given-names></name><name><surname>Solomayer</surname><given-names>E.F.</given-names></name><name><surname>Bastert</surname><given-names>G.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Treatment of metastatic bone disease in breast cancer: bisphosphonates</article-title><source>Clinical Breast Cancer</source><volume>1</volume><issue>1</issue><year>2000</year><fpage>43</fpage><lpage>51</lpage><comment>Epub 2002/03/20</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">11899389</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="bib2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" id="sbref2"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Pontiggia</surname><given-names>P.</given-names></name><name><surname>Curto</surname><given-names>F.C.</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabato</surname><given-names>A.</given-names></name><name><surname>Rotella</surname><given-names>G.B.</given-names></name><name><surname>Alonso</surname><given-names>K.</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Is metastatic breast cancer, refractory to usual therapy, curable?</article-title><source>Biomed.
