However, the results of recent studies suggest that progressive strength training can lead to increased strength and improved function, but low methodological quality and incomplete reporting on the training protocols hampers adequate interpretation of the results. This paper describes the design and training protocol of a randomized controlled trial to assess the effects of a school-based progressive functional strength training program for children with CP.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Results</title><p>Fifty-one children with Gross Motor Function Classification Systems levels I to III, aged of 6 to 13 years, were recruited. Using stratified randomization, each child was assigned to an intervention group (strength training) or a control group (usual care). The strength training was given in groups of 4&#x02013;5 children, 3 times a week, for a period of 12 weeks. Each training session focussed on four exercises out of a 5-exercise circuit. The training load was gradually increased based on the child's maximum level of strength, as determined by the 8 Repetition Maximum (8 RM). To evaluate the effectiveness of the training, all children were evaluated before, during, directly after, and 6 weeks after the intervention period. Primary outcomes in this study were gross motor function (measured with the Gross Motor Function Measure and functional muscle strength tests) and walking ability (measured with the 10-meter, the 1-minute and the timed stair test). Secondary outcomes were lower limb muscle strength (measured with a 6 RM test, isometric strength tests, and a sprint capacity test), mobility (measured with a mobility questionnaire), and sport activities (measured with the Children's Assessment of Participation and Enjoyment). Spasticity and range of motion were assessed to evaluate any adverse events.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Randomized clinical trials are considered to present the highest level of evidence. Nevertheless, it is of utmost importance to report on the design, the applied evaluation methods, and all elements of the intervention, to ensure adequate interpretation of the results and to facilitate implementation of the intervention in clinical practice if the results are positive.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Trial Register NTR1403</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common cause of movement disability in childhood, with an incidence of 1.5&#x02013;2.5 per 1000 live born children[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. It is a non-progressive disorder that covers a number of neurological conditions, resulting in an abnormal development of movement and postural control[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. From the perspective of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], CP patients present with impairments in body function such as spasticity, low muscle strength, and selective motor control. These impairments may limit the performance of activities and participation in daily life. Improving and optimizing activities and participation are important treatment goals for therapeutic interventions.</p><p>A recent review has shown that low muscle strength, and not spasticity, causes the greatest limitations in motor function in children with CP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>], and this has shifted the focus from spasticity management towards strength training for these children. To be successful, strength training must be individualized, and should involve a progressive increase in intensity, thereby stimulating strength gains that are greater than those associated with normal growth and development (i.e. "overload")[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. This is known as Progressive Resistance Exercise (PRE)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], and for this type of exercise any method can be used to bear, overcome or resist force, such as body weight, free weights or machines.</p><p>Until recently, PRE was thought to be inappropriate, or potentially dangerous for children with CP because of the unfounded assumptions that such training would increase spasticity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. However, this concern is not supported by the results of recent studies which have shown that PRE strength training programs can improve lower limb muscle strength in patients with CP without increasing spasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. These results have been summarised in recent reviews [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], in which it was further concluded that PRE strength training <italic>can </italic>increase muscle strength, but that the effects are probably over-estimated because of the low methodological quality of these studies[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], and that future studies should furthermore develop more functional training programs aiming at a maximal carry-over into everyday activities[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].</p><p>Recently, new randomized clinical trials (RCT's) have been carried out to evaluate the effect of this type of functional strength training[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] in children with CP. Conflicting results were found on isometric muscle strength[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], gross motor function[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>] and walking ability[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. This might be due to the slightly different evaluation methods, but more probably to the differences in relevant training characteristics, such as type of training (e.g. home or school based), intensity (e.g. load based on body mass or repetition maximum), progression (e.g. none, weekly, individually based) and duration of the training (e.g. 5 or 12 weeks). Unfortunately, this information was not always provided, which hampers correct interpretations. For an adequate interpretation of the effectiveness of the intervention, standardisation and reporting on all relevant aspects of the training is therefore of utmost importance.</p><p>For PRE strength training, the key principle should always be standardized: the timely progression in strength intensity based on the child's <italic>individual </italic>level of strength, to ensure the principle of progressive overload[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. This is best assessed by the repetition maximum (RM), which is the maximum number of repetitions that can be performed correctly under a given load. The heaviest load with which an exercise can be performed for 1 complete repetition with correct performance is the 1 RM. According to current guidelines, training should start with a dynamic warm-up period, initially 1 or 2 sets of 8&#x02013;15 repetitions with a light to moderate load (about 30&#x02013;60% 1 RM) to learn the right technique, and then progress to 3&#x02013;5 sets of 8&#x02013;15 repetitions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>]. Loads can safely be progressed to 70&#x02013;85% of 1 RM[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>]. A training frequency of at least 2 non-consecutive days per week is further recommended. In addition, for children the training should be fun, and group-training is thought to increase both the fun and the individual motivation to progress.</p><p>It is therefore thought that individualized, but group-given, school-based, functional PRE strength training, with sufficient frequency, intensity and progression, increases the effectiveness of the training, although these aspects need further investigation. The purpose of this study was to evaluate, in an RCT, the effectiveness of such functional PRE lower limb strengthening program in a group of children with CP. A protocol was therefore developed to train lower limb muscle strength, based on the current guidelines for PRE strength training in healthy adults[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>] and children[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>], the recent literature on strength training for CP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], and the expertise of experienced paediatric physical therapists in the Netherlands. In this protocol, the frequency, duration, weekly intensity and progression on the basis of RM testing of the training, and also the type and technique of each of the exercises were standardized. We hypothesize that children who will follow this structured functional PRE strength training program will increase in muscle strength, which accordingly will lead to functional improvement in gross motor function and walking ability, but with no negative effect increasing spasticity or decreasing range of motion, compared to children receiving usual care. This paper describes the study design and all relevant elements of the functional PRE strength training protocol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design</title><p>The study has a single-blinded, randomized controlled design and the study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>The training and assessments took place in three special schools for physically disabled children in the Netherlands, from which all the children were recruited.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>All the participants were ambulatory children with spastic unilateral or bilateral CP[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. The inclusion criteria were: 1) age between 6 and 13 years; 2) able to accept and follow verbal instructions; 3) ability to walk independently indoors, with or without walking aids (Gross Motor Function Classification System [GMFCS][<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>] levels I &#x02013; III); 4) able to participate in a group training program. Children were excluded if they had instable seizures, if they had received treatment for spasticity or surgical procedures up to 3 months (for botulinum toxin type A injections) to 6 months (for surgery) prior to the study (or planned in the study period); if any change in medication was expected during the study period; or if they suffered from other diseases that interfered with physical activity.</p><p>A paediatric physiatrist working in each school pre-selected the children, based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The parents of the children who met these criteria received written information about the study. Accordingly, the parents of each potential participant were contacted by a researcher who gave further oral explanation, and answered any questions, if necessary. Written informed consent was given by the parents, and all children who were over 12 years of age. After all the informed consents had been collected, randomization was performed per school. The children were randomly allocated according to three stratification variables: GMFCS level (I; II&#x02013;III); age (youngest: 6&#x02013;9 years; oldest 10&#x02013;13 years), and gender (boy; girl). Families were notified by means of a letter of their child's allocation to the intervention group or the control group prior to the first baseline assessment.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>At least 42 children were required to detect a difference in improvement of 5% on the Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM) between the intervention group and the control group, with a power of 0.8 and an alpha of 0.05. To allow for some drop-outs, we aimed to recruit at least 50 children (25 intervention, 25 control).</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention: Lower Limb Strength Training</title><p>The intervention group followed a 12-week functional PRE strength training program (not including holidays), 3 times a week. Each training session lasted for 45&#x02013;60 minutes.</p><p>The training replaced the conventional physical therapy program, when this was consistent with the objectives of the strength training (improvement of functional abilities by increasing muscle strength/fitness), but was additional to any other therapies (e.g. swimming, occupational therapy). The strength training was specifically designed to strengthen the anti-gravity muscles of the lower limbs (such as the glutei, vasti, gastrocnemius, soleus), while performing functional exercises in a circuit training.</p><sec><title>Circuit training</title><p>The training sessions were held in small groups (&#x000b1; 4&#x02013;5 children) with a 5-station circuit, supervised by two experienced physical therapists per group. During each training session, the children wore their regular (street) shoes, splints, trousers, and they all wore a group T-shirt to stimulate the group-feeling. Each training session started and finished with a warming up and cooling down period of 5&#x02013;10 minutes, during which muscle stretching exercises and aerobics were performed. During the main training phase, each child performed 4 different exercises on the 5-station circuit. The different stations of the circuit were named as followed: leg-press, loaded sit-to-stand, loaded game, unloaded game and relax.

The exercises at these stations were fixed: a leg-press exercise (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">1</xref>) and a loaded sit-to-stand exercise (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>). Of these, only the loaded sit-to-stand is a functional exercise, resembling an everyday activity with which ambulatory children with CP may experience difficulty (i.e. rising from a chair).</p><p>At the stations that were low or not loaded (e.g. loaded game station and unloaded game station), the most affected leg was (preferably and if possible) trained by means of unilateral exercises. All exercises at these stations were functional. These exercises were randomly chosen by the physical therapist: a lateral step up exercise or a forward step up exercise (i.e. climbing a stair or stepping up onto a kerb, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S3">3</xref>), or a half-knee rise exercise (i.e. rising from the ground, see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S4">4</xref>). If a child was not able to perform these unilateral exercises, the sit-to-stand exercise (see Additional file <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S2">2</xref>) could be performed instead.</p><p>At the stations that were highly loaded (e.g. leg-press and loaded sit-to-stand stations), correct performance of the exercises was mandatory and required very strict supervision (close one-on-one guidance per child by the physical therapist). At the stations that were less or not loaded (e.g. loaded game station and unloaded game station), somewhat less supervision was needed for these exercises (one-on-two guidance per two children by the physical therapist, so that the children could perform the exercises together). Furthermore, it was also important that the children enjoyed the training. Therefore, the exercises at the loaded game and unloaded game stations could be chosen at random. In addition, the exercises at these stations were suitable to be integrated in a game-like situation (for example: playing skittles), which could be performed together or as a competition.</p><p>At the leg-press station resistance was applied by the leg-press machine itself, which was specifically adapted for children by means of an elevated footplate (EN-Dynamic Seated Leg Press, Enraf Nonius, The Netherlands). At the other loaded stations, where functional exercises were performed, resistance was applied by means of a customised weight vest (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).</p><fig position="float" id="F1"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Weight vest.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2431-8-41-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Training volume</title><p>Except for the relax station, which served as a relax moment, each station had its own training volume (i.e. a combination of load, repetitions, sets and rest) with which the exercise was performed.</p><p>As is shown in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>, the choice of a training volume is directly related to the desired goal of muscle training, and to achieve enhanced muscle strength, the training must be based on a fixed combination of a high load (70&#x02013;95% 1 RM), 8&#x02013;12 repetitions, 1&#x02013;3 sets and sufficient rest to allow for muscle recovery. In this study we focussed on the improvement of both strength and strength/endurance training, and therefore used a high to low load and a low to medium number of repetitions. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">3</xref> presents the training volumes of the exercises at the different stations. All exercises were performed in 3 sets of 8 repetitions, with a 90 second rest in between the sets. Each exercise was performed within 7&#x02013;10 minutes. At the beginning of each new training session, every child started at one of the 5 stations, from which he/she rotated to the next, until he/she had completed 4 stations (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>). At the beginning of each subsequent training session, the child started at a different station.

The 8 RM is approximately equal to 80% 1 RM[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] (N.B.: the 1 RM test was considered to be too heavy). The 8 RM test procedures were initiated after the children had become familiar with the training program, and when they could perform the exercises correctly. To determine the 8 RM, the child started with 3 repetitions (no load) to practise the correct performance: each repetition had to be performed through full (possible) range of motion, with adequate speed (speed of repetition: extension movement: 2&#x02013;3 seconds/flexion movement: 2&#x02013;3 seconds[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]). Then, two warm-up trials of 3 repetitions were performed at 50% and 70% of the predicted 8 RM, respectively. The predicted 8 RM is based on the child's body weight, according to GMFCS-specific guidelines which we established in an earlier pilot study (see Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">4</xref>). After the third and actual test trial, the child was instructed to perform the trial at 100% of the predicted 8 RM until (temporary) muscular exhaustion, or until a maximum of 10 repetitions. If a repetition was performed incorrectly, it was not counted; and if two consecutive repetitions were performed incorrectly, the trial was ended. The criteria for incorrect technique were: without full (possible) range of motion, with incorrect technique and inadequate speed (i.e. too slow/fast). If a child performed less than 6 or more than 10 correct repetitions, a 5 to 10% load was either reduced or added, respectively. After a 3 minute rest, the trial was repeated until the child was able to perform 7&#x02013;9 repetitions, but no more.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T4"><label>Table 4</label><caption><p>Guidelines for the predicted 8 repetition maximum</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><td align="left"><bold>Station</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>GMFCS level</bold></td><td align="left"><bold>Predicted 8 RM</bold></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1.

In two other weeks (7 and 11) the training load for the loaded sit-to-stand was estimated based on the progress in 8 RM testing on the leg-press between weeks 3 and 6 and weeks 8 and 10, respectively (see Additional File <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S5">5</xref>), which was set at a minimum of 0% and a maximum of 10%.

These training loads were adjusted to new individual levels of strength, if necessary (i.e. as determined by the 8 RM test). The first 6 weeks were intended to slowly build up the training towards these maximum training loads and during the last 6 weeks the children were training at the maximum load.

It was performed on a child-adapted cycle-ergometer (Corival, Lode bv, Groningen). After a warming-up period of 5 minutes (cycling at low resistance, interspersed with three 5-second sprints), the child was asked to cycle as fast as possible for 20 seconds (sprint) against a constant force. Two performance indices were calculated (mean and peak power) with specialized software (ProCare bv, Groningen). The former reflects the child's ability to sustain high power, whereas the latter indicates the ability to produce high mechanical power in a short time.

However, until now, only three randomized trials have evaluated the effects of a PRE functional strength training program in children with CP. These studies have reported positive training effects, although their results are still not truly convincing with regard to their corresponding outcome measures. This might be due not only to a difference in the evaluation methods that were applied but also to a difference in training characteristics. The majority of studies do not present a detailed report on their training program. Not only does this hamper correct interpretation of the results, but it also hampers implementation of the intervention in clinical practise in clinical practice. So, for a correct interpretation of the effectiveness of an intervention, standardization and reporting on all relevant aspects of the training protocol is of utmost importance.</p><p>For PRE strength training in particular, every study should give a detailed description of the key principle of the PRE: the timely progression in strength intensity, based on the child's <italic>individual </italic>level of strength, to ensure the principle of progressive overload[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>]. To guarantee overload based on the individual level of strength, it should preferably be assessed according to the Repetition Maximum (RM).</p><p>Furthermore, each intervention study should also standardize and describe other relevant aspects such as frequency, duration and weekly volume of the training, and also the type and technique of each of the exercises.</p><p>Nevertheless, children with CP may present with a variety of motor disorders (e.g. poor co-ordination, loss of selective motor control), orthopaedic problems and other associated conditions (e.g. disturbances of cognition)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], which often makes individual adjustments in the performance of the exercises necessary. Despite this, individual standardization of the training <italic>should </italic>and <italic>can </italic>be applied, in order to meet the requirements of progressive overload.</p><p>This paper outlines the design and all relevant aspects of the training protocol of a randomized controlled trial examining the effects of a school and group-based functional strength training program for children with CP. Our study was based on the hypothesis that an individualized, but group and school-based, functional PRE training will strengthen the lower limbs, and will accordingly lead to functional improvements in gross motor function and walking ability in children with CP. The results of this trial will be presented as soon as they become available.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>VAS, AJD and JGB contributed equally to this work: they participated in the design, developed the training protocol, participated in the co-ordination, and drafted the manuscript.</p><p>EAR, OV, ET and MH also contributed equally to this work: they developed the training protocol, trained the participants, and participated in the co-ordination.
