Our objective in this study was to explore the functional neuromodulatory potential of tsDCS by examining its immediate and lasting effects over the repeated performance of a whole body maximal exercise in healthy volunteers. Using a double-blind, randomized, crossover, sham-controlled design we investigated the effects of 15 min of anodal tsDCS on repeated vertical countermovement jump (VCJ) performance at 0, 20, 60, and 180 minutes post-stimulation. Measurements of peak and take-off velocity, vertical displacement, peak power and work done during countermovement and push-off VCJ phases were derived from changes in vertical ground reaction force (12 performance parameters) in 12 healthy participants. The magnitude and direction of change in VCJ performance from pre- to post-stimulation differed significantly between sham and active tsDCS for 7 of the 12 VCJ performance measures (P &#x0003c; 0.05). These differences comprised of a post-sham fatigue in VCJ displacement/work done, peak to peak power and take-off velocity, and a resilience to this fatigue effect post-active tsDCS. In addition there was also an enhancement of countermovement performance and total work done (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). These changes did not vary across repeated VCJ performances over time post-tsDCS (P &#x0003e; 0.05). Our original findings demonstrate that one single session of anodal tsDCS in healthy subjects can prevent fatigue and maintain or enhance different aspects of whole body explosive motor power over repeated sets of VCJs performed over a period of three hours. The observed effects are discussed in relation to alterations in central fatigue mechanisms, muscle contraction mode during jump execution and changes in spinal cord excitability. These findings have important implications for power endurance sport performance and for neuromotor rehabilitation.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution>The Scottish Government Health Directorates</institution></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conway</surname><given-names>Bernard A.</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>Project conducted with funding allocated to the Centre for Excellence in Rehabilitation Research group from the Scottish Government Healthcare Directives grant.

To date, researchers have reported modulation of segmental spinal reflex behaviours [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], corticospinal excitability [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] and somatosensory pathway conduction [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in humans. Research on anaesthetised rodents has shown spinal DCS to influence supraspinal activity [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] and to modulate muscle force production, reflexive actions and locomotor activity [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Although these animal studies used invasive electrode placements, they do raise the possibility that tsDCS may modulate functional motor outcomes in humans.</p><p>Research on transcranial direct current stimulation (tcDCS) indicates that its effects are dependent on the orientation of the underlying neural compartments relative to the direction of current flow [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Similarly, tsDCS-evoked facilitation or inhibition of spinal neural pathways and circuits are also reported to be polarity dependent and to persist post-stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In rodent studies, anodal tsDCS is reported to depress cortically elicited muscle contractions during stimulation, but potentiate them post-stimulation, with the opposite true for cathodal tsDCS [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Polarity effects on target pathways will also depend on the site of stimulation (e.g. cervical or lumbosacral) [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. As a method of neuromodulation tsDCS is non-invasive, well tolerated by subjects, and there have been no adverse events reported following single session tsDCS interventions [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>The spinal cord is an attractive target for neuromodulation. Segmental and intersegmental circuits integrate and process multisensory and supraspinal information to refine and adapt the motor output patterns needed to coordinate and successfully perform functional motor tasks (e.g. standing, running, walking or jumping). Repeated practice and training constantly stimulate adaptation and plasticity in spinal and supraspinal pathways as a prerequisite for motor skill learning [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. TcDCS neuromodulation has also been found to enhance motor skill learning via similar neuroplastic mechanisms as practice mediated plasticity [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. By targeting the integrative neural pathways and circuits of the spinal cord, anodal tsDCS may therefore have the potential to exert positive neuromodulatory actions on circuits that influence coordinated, whole body motor performance. These effects may be beneficial in sports or during rehabilitation following brain or spinal cord injury. However, at the present time it is not known whether the application of lumbosacral tsDCS translates to any measurable or lasting effects on motor power or voluntary motor performance in humans.</p><p>Therefore the aim of this study was to determine if tsDCS applied over the lumbosacral cord could change the functional performance of a human whole body motor task. The motor task studied here is the vertical countermovement jump (VCJ) with arm swing which is a powerful, explosive plyometric exercise that requires the coordination of head, neck, trunk, and all four limbs. VCJ performance is used as a measure of whole body power in athletics [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] and can be characterised through a range of measures derived from changes in the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) generated as a person prepares and executes the jump [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. This motor task was chosen to maximise our chances of detecting any tsDCS effects on motor power during an unconstrained task comprising repeated maximal eccentric and concentric muscle activations. Although this particular motor task is not appropriate in a neurorehabilitation setting, changes in VCJ performance after tsDCS may indicate the rehabilitative potential of tsDCS for modulating motor control circuits including those involved in sitting, standing and falls prevention. In this exploratory pilot study, we investigated the influence of 15 minutes of sham and active anodal tsDCS (double blind, cross over design) on repeated maximal effort VCJ performance in healthy human volunteers over a period of three hours.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec002"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec003"><title>Subjects and ethical approval</title><p>Following approval by the University of Strathclyde Research Ethics Committee and in accordance with the declaration of Helsinki, 12 (3 female) normally active, healthy volunteers (<italic>M</italic> &#x000b1; <italic>SD</italic>: age 29 &#x000b1; 11 years and BMI 23 &#x000b1; 2) were recruited from the University campus between July 2014 and February 2015 and gave their fully informed written consent to participate in the study.

The minimum time interval between sessions was one week. Participants were asked to avoid any intensive or unaccustomed physical activity in the week preceding the tests and to avoid consuming any food or caffeinated beverages within the two hours prior to the start of each session. Otherwise, no dietary or fluid intake restrictions were applied over the course of the study. Body mass and height were recorded for all subjects during the initial consenting visit and prior to testing. Subjects were also familiarised with the tsDCS intervention and VCJ protocol and were given the opportunity to practice VCJ performance.</p></sec><sec id="sec004"><title>Vertical countermovement jump</title><p>Standing on an instrumented platform (detailed below), participants performed sets of 5 maximal effort VCJs immediately prior to and at 0, 20, 60, and 180 minutes after application of sham or active anodal tsDCS (25 VCJs per test session, 50 VCJs in total). Rest periods of 20 seconds were given between each VCJ effort, approximating to a 1:20 work to rest ratio. This was determined to be sufficient to regenerate the immediate ATP phosphocreatine energy system between each VCJ and to avoid peripheral muscle fatigue effects. Each of the five VCJ sets were preceded with a moderately paced 2 min warm up comprising stepping on and off a 15 cm stepper (Reebok, Adidas, Herzogenaurach, Germany). Participants were instructed to jump with maximal effort and to use a consistent jump technique throughout. Volunteers initiated their VCJ with a downward countermovement from a standing position and, using their arms for leverage, jumped up from the force plate with maximal effort.

Our results provide the first evidence of anodal tsDCS exerting a sustained influence on whole body motor power during the repeated performance of an explosive gross motor task in healthy subjects.</p><p>The results presented here demonstrate a clear difference in the magnitude and direction of changes in VCJ performance after sham and active anodal tsDCS. The key finding of this study is that, after sham tsDCS there was a fatigue in VCJ performance apparent over a wide range of outcome measures that was prevented following 15 minutes of 2.5 mA anodal tsDCS conditioning. These changes in performance did not vary significantly over the entire 180 minute test period. This infers that for sham tsDCS, the fatigue process was perpetuated by each subsequent VCJ set performed, whereas anodal tsDCS was able to prevent this fatigue process from engaging at any point over the repeated VCJ sets. However, at the present time, and without the benefit of further detailed physiological investigation, we are unable to state which specific physiological and neuroplastic mechanisms were influenced by anodal tsDCS and therefore can only speculate here based on our observations and the neurophysiological findings of previous tsDCS studies.</p><p>Performing repeated maximal effort whole body exercise, leads to central fatigue that diminishes performance output [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Repeated performance of stretch-shorten types of exercise also leads to long lasting muscular and neuromuscular fatigue, due, in part, to a combination of eccentric muscle tissue damage, reduced reflex sensitivity and reduced gain in spinal circuitry [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. The VCJs performed here comprised of repeated cycles of maximal extensor muscle stretch-shortening during the CM, push-off and landing phases of the jump. However, performance within each VCJ set (5 maximal effort jumps performed within an approximate 1 minute time window) did not deteriorate from the first to the fifth repetition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0173846.g004">Fig 4</xref>) and so it is unlikely that peripheral muscular effects were a significant contributing factor. Accordingly, it seems appropriate to propose that the fatigue observed in VCJ performance post-sham tsDCS condition is of central origin and that it outlasted the 180 minute test period.</p><p>The lasting fatigue protection after anodal tsDCS may be due to multiple factors. Localised anodal tsDCS-induced tissue effects may arise during stimulation, but are most likely to influence the paraspinal muscles directly below the stimulating electrodes. Local effects could include an increased local blood flow, changes in metabolism, temperature and potentially alterations in biomechanical properties such as elasticity and stiffness. However, such effects would be transitory and short-lived, persisting for only 8&#x02013;10 minutes post- stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Accordingly, it would be difficult to envisage how such changes could affect VCJ performance across the 180 minutes post-stimulation assessment period. It is more likely that anodal tsDCS exerted modulatory effects on central fatigue mechanisms.</p><p>The sustained fatigue in CM performance observed here after sham tsDCS, evidenced by reductions in CM downward displacement and power, was not only abolished after active tsDCS, but CM performance was considerably enhanced. This would suggest that tsDCS exerted effects on central mechanisms affecting the development of a fatigued state as well as potentiating motor output. The CM and landing phases of the VCJ are dominated by powerful eccentric contractions of leg extensor muscles. Interestingly, Duchateau &#x00026; Enoka [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] recently observed that spinal and corticospinal excitability is reduced during eccentric muscle activity, regardless of the degree of tension produced, highlighting the role of central inhibitory, protective mechanisms in the control of eccentric lengthening contractions. The protection against fatigue and the greater potentiation of power observed during the predominantly eccentric CM phase, compared to the push-off phase following anodal tsDCS is then worthy of further study as it may highlight differential modulatory actions on the inhibitory mechanisms proposed by Duchateau &#x00026; Enoka [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] to be involved in the regulation of eccentric contractions and ultimately motor unit excitability.</p><p>Recent research investigating the effects of tcDCS on steady state cycling endurance found that anodal stimulation attenuated central fatigue mechanisms and allowed cyclists to increase their time to exhaustion [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Similar to the effects of tcDCS on supraspinal fatigue mechanisms, it appears that anodal tsDCS interferes with the regulatory actions that spinal circuits have on motor unit excitability and eccentric contraction fatigue. The neuromodulatory effects of direct current on central fatigue processes, highlight the need to account for, and perhaps exploit, these mechanisms in future neuromodulation studies.</p><p>The fatigue protection effects of anodal tsDCS on push-off performance may be also be explained by the permissive effects of tsDCS on CM performance. The likely effect of anodal tsDCS on eccentric inhibitory mechanisms and motor unit excitability would be unimpeded eccentric extensor lengthening [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This would increase downward velocity, displacement and muscle force development, and result in increased CM braking power, transition and push-off GRF, as the body is brought to a halt briefly prior to extending upwards from its lower position to take-off. Our findings post-anodal tsDCS are consistent with this observation. Improved coupling of body segment accelerations during countermovement may also contribute to the increase in these performance parameters and therefore cannot be discounted [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>Although the mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated, non-invasive anodal tsDCS can be predicted to lead to changes in spinal excitability via alterations in sensory axon excitability, inter-neuronal excitatory and inhibitory bias, and in communications between spinal cord segments [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Studies in humans [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] and animals [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] suggest that the polarizing effects of direct current change the biophysical properties of the neural membranes, causing lasting changes in excitability. Depending on the current density and distribution within the tissues of the spinal cord, populations of interneurons will be affected differentially due to their spatial location, geometry and background level of activity [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0173846.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. By studying a repeated whole body exercise, our observations point to a complex but positive interaction of tsDCS neuromodulatory effects. Our observations highlight the value of studying natural unconstrained functional motor tasks in contrast to more standard approaches, such as isometric muscle strength testing. The tsDCS effect is not uniform across the different phases of the VCJ and further investigations may allow us to further explore how alterations in spinal excitability affect motor control, motor unit recruitment and interlimb coordination during voluntary functional movement.</p><p>Individuals vary significantly in their response to tcDCS [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] and the participants in this study varied significantly in their responses to anodal tsDCS (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0173846.t002">Table 2</xref>). This may have been due to individual differences in somatotype, physical conditioning level and the level of effective current reaching neural compartments due to differences in body composition. However, an important genetic source of variation in response to direct current stimulation has recently been identified. A key mediator and promoter of activity-dependent neuroplasticity after physical activity [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] or direct current stimulation [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] is brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Carriers of a common BDNF single nucleotide polymorphism (Met SNP; rs6265) have a reduced capacity for activity-dependent BDNF secretion [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] and have significantly different neuroplastic responses to tcDCS [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] and tsDCS [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] compared to those with the more common BDNF genotype. This may explain some of the unknown variability in our subjects and highlights the need to take account of such genetic factors as significant sources of variation in future neuromodulation studies [<xref rid="pone.0173846.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>This exploratory study was limited in that it was a preliminary observation study only. Further tsDCS investigation is merited using larger sample sizes to replicate these findings and elucidate the neurophysiological, biomechanical and genetic mechanisms underlying the lasting changes in neuromotor function. Further study would also help determine the potential neurorehabilitation benefits of anodal tsDCS for those with sporting injury or central nervous system injury that affects mobility, and possibly for falls prevention in the older adult. Indeed, the use of spinal rather than transcranial direct current stimulation, minimises the chances of unknown effects due to concurrent stimulation of brain areas unrelated to the targeted motor task. Studies including repeated tsDCS application with homogenous groups of well-trained endurance and power athletes are also merited. These may help elucidate more specific neuromuscular mechanisms underlying tsDCS effects and whether effects are additive or have a ceiling in performance gain. It should be noted that although none of our participants sustained any injury during this study, given the effect of tsDCS on protective fatigue mechanisms, the risk of injury in maximal eccentric exercise after tsDCS may be increased.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec012"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, using a double-blind, randomized, crossover sham-controlled study design, we have demonstrated for the first time that anodal tsDCS can induce lasting fatigue-resistance and maintain and enhance different aspects of whole body motor performance over time. Anodal tsDCS appears to have created a permissive state in spinal circuits where a lasting resistance to central fatigue was combined with varying degrees of multisegmental facilitatory, and neuroplastic effects to maintain and enhance different aspects of VCJ performance. The effects persisted for at least 3 hours and were achieved after one 15 application of easy to administer, comfortable anodal tsDCS stimulation and in the absence of a physical training intervention. These effects have immensely important implications for power endurance sport performance or sports in which there is high level of repeated reactive rebound activity. The lasting effects of anodal tsDCS on neuromotor circuits may also have important implications for falls prevention or rehabilitation after central nervous system injury.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec013"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0173846.s001"><label>S1 Video</label><caption><title>Vertical countermovement jump performance.</title><p>Performance outcomes were determined from the initiation of the jump until the point of take-off only.</p><p>(MP4)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0173846.s001.mp4"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to acknowledge Mr Fergus Morison and Dr Catherine Macleod for their contribution to initial study design, Dr Euan McCaughey for his assistance in VCJ data collection and initial data processing.</p></ack><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0173846.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Winkler</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Hering</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Straube</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name>. <article-title>Spinal DC stimulation in humans modulates post-activation depression of the H-reflex depending on current polarity</article-title>. <source>Clinical neurophysiology: official journal of the International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology</source>. <year>2010</year>;<volume>121</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>957</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>61</lpage>.<pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20153248</pub-id></mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0173846.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Hubli</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Dietz</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Schrafl-Altermatt</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Bolliger</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name>. <article-title>Modulation of spinal neuronal excitability by spinal direct currents and locomotion after spinal cord injury</article-title>. <source>Clinical Neurophysiology</source>. <year>2013</year>;<volume>124</volume>(<issue>6</issue>):<fpage>1187</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>95</lpage>. <comment>doi: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.clinph.2012.11.021">10.1016/j.clinph.2012.11.021</ext-link></comment>
