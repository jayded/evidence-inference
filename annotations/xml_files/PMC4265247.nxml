Skin, like all organs of the body, undergoes alterations due to the passage of time and changes are primarily characterized by a loss of elasticity, increased roughness, uneven skin tone and the appearance of wrinkles. The prevalence of pruritus also increases in aged skin, reflecting poor hydration, impaired skin barrier and altered neural function <xref rid="b1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="b2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>.</p><p>The underlying biological mechanisms that give rise to these symptoms are numerous, including changes in dermal extracellular matrix (ECM) turnover, increases in inflammatory status and reduction in blood flow. Skin wrinkling in particular arises, in part, from atrophy of the dermal layer of which type I collagen is the major component. This protein is by far the most abundant in human skin, comprising more than 90% of its dry weight and it confers structural integrity on the skin <xref rid="b3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>. With increasing age, the amount and integrity of collagen in skin is reduced, a process that is further enhanced in photodamage <xref rid="b4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>. This decline is brought about by increased expression of collagen-degrading matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) with age, coupled with the failure to replace the damaged collagen with newly synthesized protein <xref rid="b5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>.</p><p>The period of most rapid decline in skin quality is around the menopause, with the dramatic decline in circulating oestrogen correlating strongly with loss of dermal collagen and contributing significantly to pronounced skin atrophy, dryness and sensitivity <xref rid="b6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, along with decreased elasticity and wrinkle formation <xref rid="b7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>. Furthermore, the positive effects of oestrogen replacement on skin have been demonstrated in clinical studies that have shown that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) greatly improves the skin of menopausal women <xref rid="b8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>. Increased collagen content, dermal thickness and elasticity have also been demonstrated <xref rid="b10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>.</p><p>Because many of the age-associated changes in skin occur deep in the dermis, they are often difficult to influence with topical products. Effective delivery of nutrients through the diet to the lower region of the skin, particularly to the collagen-producing dermal fibroblasts, is therefore an attractive option. There has been an increasing amount of evidence in recent years showing the potential effects of diet on skin ageing, with new insights into the relationship between food intake and skin appearance beginning to emerge <xref rid="b11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>.</p><p>There is now convincing evidence from <italic>in vitro</italic>, animal and human studies that dietary constituents can afford an important degree of endogenous photoprotection and may therefore be presumed to help reduce skin photoageing. Whilst the level of sun protection (measured as the sun protection factor; SPF) with an SPF 2 to 4 is considerably lower than that afforded by topical sun creams with an SPF of 5 to &#x0003e;50, over a lifetime systemic dietary, photoprotection is still expected to contribute very significantly to overall improved skin appearance.</p><p>The ability of a nutrient to provide systemic photoprotection requires it to have one or more of the following functions: prevent the absorption of UV light by skin, protect target molecules by acting as an antioxidant scavenger, induce cellular repair systems or suppress cellular responses such as inflammation. Vitamins such as vitamin C and vitamin E <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, carotenoids (E.g. lycopene) <xref rid="b17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and <italic>n</italic>-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids <xref rid="b23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> have all been shown to provide photoprotective benefits, following oral consumption and are believed to operate through one or more of the above mechanisms. Carotenoids are highly effective scavengers of singlet oxygen <xref rid="b25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, whilst <italic>n</italic>-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids have been shown to influence inflammation in skin through down regulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and leukotriene B4 (LTB4) <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>. Both vitamin E and vitamin C form part of the skin's natural defence against reactive oxygen species and their interaction is thought to be particularly important in the protection of skin against photo-oxidation <xref rid="b30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>. Vitamin C is also an essential cofactor in the biosynthesis of collagen, an important process in the prevention of skin ageing <xref rid="b31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>.</p><p>Given the association of oestrogen levels with deterioration in skin quality at menopause, plant-derived compounds that are able to mimic oestrogen have also received much attention as potential anti-ageing nutrients. These so-called phytoestrogens have been described as a partial alternative to HRT, due to their ability to bind to and activate the oestrogen receptor <xref rid="b32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="b33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>. Activation of this receptor has also been associated with induction of collagen synthesis by dermal fibroblasts <xref rid="b34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>. Phytoestrogens are believed to offer potential therapies for hormonal-dependent conditions, including the menopause, without the unwanted side effects associated with HRT <xref rid="b35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>. Indeed, epidemiological studies have indicated a strong correlation between the consumption of soya products in the Far East, containing high levels of phytoestrogens and reduced incidence of hormone-related diseases, including some menopausal symptoms <xref rid="b36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>. In addition to their hormonal-like effect, dietary phytoestrogens have also been reported to exert their effects via non-hormonal mechanisms <xref rid="b39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>. It is therefore hypothesized that long-term consumption of foods containing phytoestrogens may exert anti-ageing effects in post-menopausal women, including alleviation of skin-associated symptoms.</p><p>The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the effect on skin wrinkling, of a combination of ingredients reported to influence key factors involved in skin ageing; namely inflammation, collagen synthesis and oxidative/UV stress. A supplemented drink was therefore developed containing soy isoflavones, lycopene, vitamin C and vitamin E and given to post-menopausal women with a capsule containing fish oil.</p><p>Post-menopausal women are considered a useful cohort to study, with respect to skin ageing, as the quality of skin declines dramatically in women following the menopause. Any intervention aimed at correcting the symptoms of skin ageing are therefore likely to have a greater effect in this target population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec><title>Randomized controlled study</title><p>The study was double-blind and placebo-controlled and conducted by ProDERM Institute for Applied Dermatological Research (Hamburg, Germany) between January and July 2006.</p><p>Eligible subjects were healthy, non-smoking, post-menopausal females (skin type I-III as described by the Fitzpatrick skin type scale <xref rid="b40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>) who were not receiving HRT, not using dietary supplements and with a BMI between 18 and 33&#x000a0;kg&#x000a0;m<sup>&#x02212;2</sup>. Power calculations for the smallest difference between the treatments were performed by bootstrapping data of sample sizes of 101 individuals from a previous double-blind placebo-controlled study with identical primary objectives <xref rid="b41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>. These calculations indicated that a sample size of 50 individuals per treatment group would be sufficient to achieve a power of 75%.</p><p>Subjects were allocated to treatment groups using a random allocation procedure in SAS (SAS Institute Inc., Cary NC, U.S.A).

We have shown that a combination of isoflavones, omega-3 fatty acids, lycopene, vitamin C and vitamin E when consumed orally for 14&#x000a0;weeks can significantly reduce the depth of facial wrinkles. We have also demonstrated, for the first time with an oral product, that the improvement is associated with increased deposition of new collagen fibres.</p><p>We have performed a double-blind randomized controlled investigation to assess whether a combination of dietary ingredients, selected for their proposed skin anti-ageing benefits, can significantly improve the appearance of facial wrinkles. The study was conducted following the principles of international good clinical practice standards, with products coded and randomized at source and with subjects, investigators and statistician remaining &#x02018;blind&#x02019; to the coding until the study and initial data analysis were complete.</p><p>We observed no benefit of the test or placebo products on skin colour, hydration or barrier quality. However, we did demonstrate that individuals consuming the active test products showed significantly improved skin texture and reduced wrinkle depth when compared with the placebo group. On average, there was a 10% reduction in wrinkle depth in the test group when compared with placebo.</p><p>Interestingly, we also demonstrated a baseline interaction effect with regard to wrinkle depth and response to treatment, that is, the deeper the wrinkle the greater the reduction in depth after 14&#x000a0;weeks. This potentially highlights the mechanistic action of the treatment. The smaller wrinkles as measured by PRIMOS technology are most likely a result of surface changes in the upper epidermal layers, whilst deeper wrinkles are potentially caused by alterations in the deeper dermal layer of skin. Any nutritional intervention therefore, taken orally is likely to have a greater effect on this latter type of wrinkle, so individuals with deeper wrinkles will experience the greatest benefit.</p><p>Interest in the role of specific food ingredients on promoting optimal skin condition has grown considerably in the past few years, with new insights into the relationship between food intake and skin health beginning to emerge. There are now comprehensive clinical data demonstrating the photoprotective benefits of dietary carotenoids <xref rid="b51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>,<xref rid="b52" ref-type="bibr">52</xref> vitamins E &#x00026; C <xref rid="b13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> and fish oil (containing EPA and DHA) <xref rid="b27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>. Furthermore, recent studies have indicated that oral intake of soy isoflavone aglycones appears to improve the aged skin of middle-aged women <xref rid="b53" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b55" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we examined the distribution of collagen in skin samples taken at the beginning and end of the study. Collagen is the main structural protein of the skin, and the abrupt onset of visible skin ageing around the menopause is primarily the consequence of a lower production of collagen, the supportive protein network of the skin <xref rid="b56" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b58" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>.</p><p>We found that a significantly higher number of individuals consuming the test product (test group 2) showed increased levels of collagen in skin biopsies after 14&#x000a0;weeks, than those who consumed placebo products. To our knowledge, this is the first published report of increased collagen production in skin as a result of an oral intervention.</p><p>A reduction in the level of collagen synthesis and general decline in the quality of existing collagen has been reported to contribute greatly to the increase in wrinkles and loss of firmness associated with ageing skin <xref rid="b59" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>. To obtain real wrinkle reduction effects therefore, matrix rejuvenation would be needed. The increase in collagen observed provides a potentially underlying reason for the reduction in wrinkle depth demonstrated in the study.</p><p>The ability of the ingredients described here to induce skin collagen is further supported by evidence from previously published studies. Cultured human fibroblasts <italic>in vitro</italic> treated with an isoflavone soy-containing extract demonstrated an increased level of collagen synthesis <xref rid="b60" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>, whilst mice fed dietary soy isoflavones also showed increased deposition of collagen in their skin <xref rid="b61" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>. In addition, there are numerous reports of omega-3 fatty acids influencing collagen production in ligaments and connective tissue cells <xref rid="b62" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>,<xref rid="b63" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>. Furthermore, addition of omega-3 fatty acids to mouse 3T3 cells <italic>in vitro</italic> has also been shown to be associated with enhanced collagen synthesis <xref rid="b64" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>. More recently, increased levels of collagen were also detected in human skin following topical application of omega-3 fatty acids <xref rid="b65" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>.</p><p>Surprisingly, in this investigation, we were unable to detect any significant changes between the quantity and quality of elastin fibres between test and placebo groups. In fact, detailed histological evaluation revealed that the papillary microfibril scaffolds of elastin were already well organized and uniform in distribution and excellent in condition. These histological observations may provide further support to the lack of beneficial effects we observed between test and placebo firmness and elasticity measurements.</p><p>In conclusion, we believe that the combination of ingredients, rather than the level of each individual active, is the most important aspect for the overall functionality of the mix and that this study demonstrates that consumption of these specific nutritional ingredients is able to induce a clinically measureable improvement in the depth of facial wrinkles following long-term use. This improvement is associated with increased deposition of newly formed collagen in the dermis of panellists consuming the active combination.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank Dr Thomas Brenn, Edinburgh Dermatopathology, for expert visual examination and quantitation of histological samples and Winfried Theis and Tony Dadd, Unilever Data Science, for statistical analyses and interpretation.</p></ack><sec><title>Sources of funding</title><p>Unilever R&#x00026;D Colworth funded the research.</p></sec><sec><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>All the authors are employees of the industrial funder of this research (Unilever R&#x00026;D Colworth).</p></sec><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Garibyan</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiou</surname><given-names>AS</given-names></name><name><surname>Elmariah</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Advanced aging skin and itch: addressing an unmet need</article-title><source>Dermatol.
