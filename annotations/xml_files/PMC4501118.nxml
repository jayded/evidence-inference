Miglustat-related GI disturbances are thought to arise from the inhibition of intestinal disaccharidases, mainly sucrase isomaltase. We report the effects of a co-administered dietary probiotic, <italic>S. boulardii</italic>, on the GI tolerability of miglustat in healthy adult subjects.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, two-treatment cross-over trial, healthy adult male and female subjects were randomly allocated to treatment sequences, A&#x02013;B and B&#x02013;A (treatment A - miglustat 100&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;t.i.d. + placebo; treatment B - miglustat 100&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;t.i.d. + <italic>S. boulardii</italic> [500&#x000a0;mg, b.i.d.]). GI tolerability data were collected in patient diaries. The primary endpoint was the total number of &#x02018;diarrhea days&#x02019; (&#x02265;3 loose stools within a 24-h period meeting Bristol Stool Scores [BSS] 6&#x02013;7) based on WHO criteria. Secondary endpoints comprised numerous other diarrhea and GI tolerability indices.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Twenty-one subjects received randomized therapy in each treatment sequence (total N&#x02009;=&#x02009;42), and overall, 37 (88&#x000a0;%) subjects completed the study. The total number of diarrhea days was &#x0003c;1.5 for both treatment sequences, and approximately 60&#x000a0;% of subjects did not experience diarrhea during either treatment period. The mean (SD) number of diarrhea days was lower with miglustat&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>S. boulardii</italic> (0.8 [2.4] days) than with miglustat&#x02009;+&#x02009;placebo (1.3 [2.4] days), but the paired treatment difference was not statistically significant (&#x02212;0.5 [2.4] days; p&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.159). However, a significant treatment difference (&#x02212;0.7 [1.9]; p&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05) was identified after <italic>post hoc</italic> exclusion of a clear outlier who had a very high number of diarrhea days (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13) and inconsistent GI tolerability reporting. The incidence of the GI AEs was higher with miglustat&#x02009;+&#x02009;placebo (82&#x000a0;%) than with miglustat&#x02009;+&#x02009;<italic>S. boulardii</italic> (73&#x000a0;%).

Miglustat is also indicated for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult and pediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease (NP-C) in the EU, Japan, and other countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p>Safety and tolerability monitoring during clinical trials in both GD1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] and NP-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] has consistently shown gastrointestinal (GI) disturbances such as diarrhea, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, nausea and vomiting as the most frequent adverse effects associated with miglustat therapy. These GI adverse effects occurred primarily during the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment, and were observed in 80&#x000a0;% of patients during the first 6&#x000a0;months compared with 50&#x02013;60&#x000a0;% thereafter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], and have been reported as the most common reason for miglustat discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. GI tolerability is therefore an important matter as it can have an impact on treatment compliance (particularly among young patients with NP-C), thereby reducing treatment benefits.</p><p>GI disturbances during miglustat treatment are thought to arise from the inhibition of intestinal disaccharidases, mainly sucrase isomaltase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Miglustat (1,5 (butylimino)-1,5-dideoxy-D-glucitol) &#x02013; a glucose analog &#x02013; inhibits the human disaccharidase, sucrase, which cleaves sucrose at the O-C (glucose) bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Furthermore, relatively little inhibition of intestinal lactase, and down-regulation of sucrase expression in gastrointestinal epithelium have been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Together, these effects lead to maldigestion of sucrose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], preventing the release of the monosaccharides, glucose and fructose, for further intestinal absorption. Undigested sucrose that is not absorbed subsequently causes osmotic diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Bacterial fermentation of unabsorbed material can also lead to flatulence and abdominal distension/discomfort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Adaptations within the GI system, such as an enhanced capacity for fermentation in the cecum via adaptation of the microflora, are considered to account for partial resolution of GI disturbances in miglustat-treated patients over time. Additionally, anti-propulsive medications (e.g., loperamide) can help to ameliorate GI disturbances such as diarrhea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Dietary modifications at or before initiation of miglustat therapy (e.g., adoption of a low-carbohydrate diet, alongside changes to maintain adequate caloric intake) have also been shown to have some positive impact on GI tolerability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], and a gradual increase in dose up to the full dose during the first 3&#x000a0;weeks of therapy has been found to be helpful (Amato D, personal communication).</p><p>Other methods to improve the GI tolerability of miglustat have been suggested, but as yet there are few published data to support their use. The probiotic delivery of additional sucrase activity to the lower intestine during either initial or ongoing miglustat therapy has been suggested as a way to enhance GI adaptation. A purified formulation of the saccharomyces cerevisiae-derived invertase, sacrosidase (Sucraid&#x000ae;), was shown to be beneficial in patients with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency &#x02013; a condition where patients experience GI symptoms that are analogous to those observed in miglustat-treated patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] &#x02013; and was also successful in alleviating diarrhea in a pediatric NP-C patient (Marquardt T, personal communication). Administration of lyophilized <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Baker&#x02018;s yeast) has also been reported to improve clinical symptoms in children with congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. A Phase 1 clinical study with miglustat showed a positive effect on treatment-related diarrhea after co-administration with Baker&#x02018;s yeast extract (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>; data on file at Actelion).</p><p>There is anecdotal evidence of favorable effects from the co-administration of miglustat with <italic>Saccharomyces boulardii</italic> probiotics (Burlina A, personal communication). <italic>S. boulardii</italic> produces a high amount of invertase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>], and may be a good candidate because yeast-secreted sucrase cleaves sucrose at the O-C (fructose) bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and is not expected to be inhibited by miglustat, which is a glucose analog. The probiotic formulation, Florastor&#x000ae; (syn. HANSEN CBS5926; Biocodex, France) contains lyophilized cells of the <italic>S. boulardii</italic> CNCM I-745 yeast strain, and is indicated in both adults and children for the reduction of diarrhea from a number of causes (e.g., recurrent C<italic>lostridium difficile</italic>-associated diarrhea, GI relapses of Crohn&#x02019;s disease or ulcerative colitis). We report findings from a clinical study that assessed the effect of this widely available probiotic formulation on the GI tolerability profile of miglustat in healthy subjects.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and subjects</title><p>This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-period, two-treatment cross-over Phase 1 trial conducted at the Phase 1 unit at BioPharma Services Inc (Toronto, Canada) in healthy adult subjects between 25 February and 7 June, 2013.
