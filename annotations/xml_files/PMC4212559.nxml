Japanese with T2DM are not often obese and can show low insulin secretion different to Caucasians with T2DM<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>; so evidence of preventative diabetology for the Japanese is also required.

<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> This study was an unmasked, multicenter, randomized controlled trial. The randomized, parallel group trial took place at 32 public health centers in Japan. Participants with IGT were randomly assigned to either an intensive lifestyle intervention group (ILG) or a usual care group (UCG). The participants were followed up for T2DM. The follow up of the participants started in April 1999 and the last case completed in April 2008.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Participants</title><p>Participants with IGT, aged 30&#x02013;60&#x02005;years, were recruited through health checkups conducted at each collaborative center. The recruitment started in March 1999 and was completed in December 2002. A two-step strategy was adopted for identifying participants with IGT as described previously.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> The definition of IGT using 75&#x02005;g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) was based on the WHO&#x02019;s criteria.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Those with (1) a previous diagnosis of any type of DM other than gestational diabetes; (2) a history of gastrectomy; (3) a physical condition such as ischemic heart disease, heart failure, exercise-induced asthma, and orthopedic problems where exercise was not allowed by a doctor; (4) definitive liver and kidney diseases; (5) autoimmune diseases; and (6) a habit of drinking heavily (69&#x02005;g or more of ethanol per day<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>) were excluded.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Randomization</title><p>Participants were randomly allocated (allocation ratio 1:1) to the ILG or the UCG, using a computer-generated randomization. The Taves method of minimization<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> was used to ensure that the groups were balanced for public health centers, gender, age groups (30&#x02013;39/40&#x02013;44/45&#x02013;49/50&#x02013;54/55&#x02013;60&#x02005;years), the body mass index (BMI) levels (&#x0003c;19.8/19.8&#x02013;24.1/24.2&#x02013;26.3/&#x02265;26.4&#x02005;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and FPG (&#x0003c;100/100&#x02013;109/110&#x02013;125&#x02005;mg/dL).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Sample size</title><p>According to prospective studies on the Japanese population, the yearly incidence of T2DM among participants with IGT varies between 1% and 5%.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;16</xref> Therefore, it was assumed that the 6-year cumulative incidence of T2DM would be 30% in the control group. The present study was designed to detect a 50% reduction in the incidence by the intervention. Thus the sample size required was 313 with a type 1 error of 5%, with 80% power (&#x003b2;=20%) at the two-tailed 5% significance level, and allowing for a withdrawal rate of 30%.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Intervention</title><p>The goals of intervention were: (1) to reduce initial body weight by 5% in overweight and obese participants and (2) to increase energy expenditure due to leisure time physical activity by 700&#x02005;kcal/week. The participants in the ILG received four group sessions on a healthy lifestyle for the prevention of T2DM during the initial 6&#x02005;months, and an individual session was further conducted biannually during the 3&#x02005;years. The interventions were carried out by the study nurse in each collaborative center in the form of group as well as individual sessions, using the guidelines, curriculum and educational materials provided by the committee of the study group. The session was conducted based on theoretical concepts and techniques for behavioral change, such as self-efficacy, self-monitoring and the transtheoretical model.<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></p><p>The participants in the UCG received only one group session on a healthy lifestyle for the prevention of T2DM at the outset.
