We assumed that GL could be used as a suitable alternative to the standard FFS for nasal intubation of oropharyngeal cancer patients. We compared GL and FFS in terms of safety and efficacy of intubation of these patients.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>This randomised, prospective study was conducted from January 20, 2016, to March 13, 2016, after obtaining the institutional ethical committee approval and written informed consent from each patient. We included 54 patients. Inclusion criteria were patients undergoing elective surgery for oropharyngeal cancer, aged 20&#x02013;60 years, belonging to the American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status I or II with Mallampati Score[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] II or III. Exclusion criteria included patient refusal, restricted mouth opening, bleeding tendency or any contraindication to nasal intubation. Patients were divided randomly (by computed randomisation codes maintained in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes) into two equal groups: Group G in which intubation was done using GL (Verathon Medical, Bothell, WA, USA) and Group <italic>F</italic> in which intubation was performed using FFS (Karl Storz Endoscopy, Tuttlingen, Germany).</p><p>Each patient was studied inside the operating room after connecting basic monitors (pulse oximeter, electrocardiogram, non-invasive blood pressure and end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub>). Patients of both groups received pre-medication with glycopyrrolate 0.3 mg intravenous (IV), phenylephrine nasal drops, then nebulisation using 2% lignocaine for 10 min, followed by topical anaesthesia of the mucosa of the nose, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] using lignocaine 10% nasal spray and sedation by IV infusion of remifentanil hydrochloride (Ultiva<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Mylan) starting at 0.1 &#x003bc;g/kg/min. It was gradually increased till target Ramsay Sedation Scale[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] 3 was reached (Ramsay Scale: (1) anxious and agitated or restless, (2) co-operative, oriented, (3) responsive to commands only, (4) responsive to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus, (5) sluggish response to light glabellar tap or loud auditory stimulus, (6) unresponsive). Pre-oxygenation was provided with 100% oxygen using closed circuit and face mask for 3 min till the point of end-tidal O<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;80%. The opaque envelope was opened (both devices were prepared and ready for use), and then we started awake nasal intubation attempt by one of the two authors (both well trained and familiar with both GL and FFS). In both groups, we measured intubation time in seconds (our primary outcome) using stopwatch (defined as the time from start of insertion of either GL or FFS till detection of end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> &#x0003e;20 mmHg from endotracheal tube); secondary outcomes were success rate on the first attempt (considered a failed attempt if intubation time &#x0003e;3 min); Cormack and Lehane glottic score[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] (Grade 1: Most of the glottic opening can be seen, Grade 2: Only the posterior portion of the glottis or only arytenoid cartilages, Grade 3: Only the epiglottis but no portion of the glottis, Grade 4: Neither the glottis nor the epiglottis can be seen) and incidence of complications (e.g., sore throat, post-intubation bleeding). Sore throat was evaluated once at 2 h after full recovery of general anaesthesia.</p><p>The sample size was estimated based on the paper published by Abdelmalak <italic>et al</italic>., 2011,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] who reported that the median (IQR [range]) time to intubation was 37 (25&#x02013;48 [19&#x02013;81]) s with the GlideScope and 43 (35&#x02013;58 [26&#x02013;96]) s with the flexible fibreoptic bronchoscope. A total sample size54 patients (27 in each group) was arrived at withpower 80% and significant level of 5% to detect a difference of 45 secs or greater.</p><p>Statistical Package for Social Sciences (Chicago, IL, USA) version 17.0 was used for statistical analysis. Mean &#x000b1; SD was used for description of intubation time. Percentage was used to compare success of first attempt and Cormack and Lehane glottic score using Chi-square test. <italic>P</italic> values were set as statistically significant at 0.05.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The total number of participants of the study was 54 patients who were randomly assigned, received intended treatment and were analysed for the primary outcome.

This result is similar to those of a recent study of morbidly obese patients undergoing oral intubation.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>Regarding complications, we did not detect any case of post-intubation bleeding; only three cases of the sore throat in each group was observed.</p><p>One of the limitations to our study was we included patients with Mallampati airway class 2 and 3 only and the second limitation was that we did not consider adding other airway assessment parameters such as thyromental distance and neck mobility. The sample size was relatively small. We recommend adding these parameters and use of larger sample sizes during future studies.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>GL could be a useful alternative to the standard FFS for nasal intubation of patients with oropharyngeal cancer with shorter intubation time, excellent glottic view, and similar rate of intubation success for with minimal rate of complications.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Financial support and sponsorship</title><p>Nil.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-2" sec-type="COI-statement"><title>Conflicts of interest</title><p>There are no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>KN</given-names></name><name><surname>Botros</surname><given-names>DB</given-names></name><name><surname>Groban</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Bryan</surname><given-names>YF</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Anatomic and physiopathologic changes affecting the airway of the elderly patient: Implications for geriatric-focused airway management</article-title><source>Clin Interv Aging</source><year>2015</year><volume>10</volume><fpage>1925</fpage><lpage>34</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26673904</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Liew</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name><name><surname>Leong</surname><given-names>XF</given-names></name><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Awake tracheal intubation in a patient with a supraglottic mass with the Bonfils fibrescope after failed attempts with a flexible fibrescope</article-title><source>Singapore Med J</source><year>2015</year><volume>56</volume><fpage>e139</fpage><lpage>41</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25902720</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Apfelbaum</surname><given-names>JL</given-names></name><name><surname>Hagberg</surname><given-names>CA</given-names></name><name><surname>Caplan</surname><given-names>RA</given-names></name><name><surname>Blitt</surname><given-names>CD</given-names></name><name><surname>Connis</surname><given-names>RT</given-names></name><name><surname>Nickinovich</surname><given-names>DG</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Practice guidelines for management of the difficult airway: An updated report by the American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Management of the Difficult Airway</article-title><source>Anesthesiology</source><year>2013</year><volume>118</volume><fpage>251</fpage><lpage>70</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23364566</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref4"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Prasanna</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhat</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Nasotracheal intubation: An overview</article-title><source>J Maxillofac Oral Surg</source><year>2014</year><volume>13</volume><fpage>366</fpage><lpage>72</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">26224998</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref5"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Choi</surname><given-names>HJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>HG</given-names></name><name><surname>Lim</surname><given-names>TH</given-names></name><name><surname>Chung</surname><given-names>HS</given-names></name><name><surname>Cho</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Oh</surname><given-names>YM</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Endotracheal intubation using a GlideScope video laryngoscope by emergency physicians: A multicentre analysis of 345 attempts in adult patients</article-title><source>Emerg Med J</source><year>2010</year><volume>27</volume><fpage>380</fpage><lpage>2</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">20442169</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref6"><label>6</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Abdelmalak</surname><given-names>BB</given-names></name><name><surname>Bernstein</surname><given-names>E</given-names></name><name><surname>Egan</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Abdallah</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>You</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Sessler</surname><given-names>DI</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>GlideScope&#x000ae;
