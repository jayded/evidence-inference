pain is a common problem, with 30% to 50% of the American population affected annually. While the majority of these shoulder problems improve, there is a high rate of recurrence, as 54% of patients experience persistent symptoms 3 years after onset.</p></sec><sec><title>Purpose:</title><p>Posterior shoulder tightness has been shown to alter glenohumeral (GH) kinematics. Clinically, posterior shoulder contractures result in a significant loss of internal rotation and abduction (ABD). In this study, the effect of a posterior capsular contracture on GH kinematics was investigated using an intact cadaveric shoulder without violating the joint capsule or the rotator cuff.</p></sec><sec><title>Study Design:</title><p>Controlled laboratory study.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods:</title><p>Glenohumeral motion, humeral load, and subacromial contact pressure were measured in 6 fresh-frozen left shoulders during passive ABD from 60&#x000b0; to 100&#x000b0; using an automated robotic upper extremity testing system. Baseline values were compared with the experimental condition in which the full thickness of posterior tissues was plicated without decompressing the joint capsule.</p></sec><sec><title>Results:</title><p>Posterior soft tissue plication resulted in increased compression between the humeral head and the glenoid (axial load) at 90&#x000b0; of ABD. Throughout ABD, the posterior contracture increased the anterior and superior moment on the humeral head, but it did not change the GH kinematics in this intact model. As a result, there was no increase in the subacromial contact pressure during ABD with posterior plication.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion:</title><p>In an intact cadaveric shoulder, posterior contracture does not alter GH motion or subacromial contact pressure during passive ABD. By tightening the soft tissue envelope posteriorly, there is an increase in compressive load on the articular cartilage and anterior/superior force on the humeral head. These findings suggest that subacromial impingement in the setting of a posterior soft tissue contracture may result from alterations in scapulothoracic motion, not changes in GH kinematics.</p></sec><sec><title>Clinical Relevance:</title><p>This investigation demonstrates that posterior capsular plication increases the axial load on the shoulder joint during ABD. While a significant difference from baseline was observed in the plicated condition, posterior capsular plication did not change GH motion or subacromial contact pressure significantly.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>shoulder biomechanics</kwd><kwd>motion analysis</kwd><kwd>subacromial space</kwd><kwd>plication</kwd><kwd>glenohumeral motion</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>edited-state</meta-name><meta-value>corrected-proof</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><p>Shoulder pain is a common problem, affecting 30% to 50% of the American population annually.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> While the majority of these shoulder problems improve, there is a high rate of recurrence, as 54% of patients experience persistent symptoms 3 years after onset.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> In 2008, rotator cuff pain and injuries resulted in approximately 2 million consultations, and more than 53,000 surgical repairs were performed in the United States alone.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="bibr42-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">42</xref></sup>

Clinically, this problem leads to increased subacromial contact pressure by altering both GH motion and scapulothoracic (ST) motion. In a cadaveric study, Grossman et al<sup><xref rid="bibr11-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> found a posterosuperior shift in the humerus after simulating a posterior capsular contracture.

Additionally, Anderson et al, in a cadaveric study, demonstrated that changes in the overhead athlete can be attributed to the posterior capsule. In patients with persistent disability, surgical release of the posterior capsule has been shown to relieve pain.<sup><xref rid="bibr44-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">44</xref></sup>
</p><p>In prior studies, GH and ST motions were not quantified.

</p><p>It is important to understand the interplay between scapulothoracic motion and rotator cuff pathology because it has important clinical implications as a result of the high incidence of shoulder-related injury and morbidity. Similarly, its treatment and prevention have significant economic consequences. No previous study has clearly demonstrated the cause-effect relationship between posterior capsular contracture and subacromial impingement because of improper methodology or experimental setting. Unfortunately, investigations well-positioned to research this problem have inconclusive results because by violating the joint capsule when manipulating the rotator cuff, the negative pressure within the GH joint is released, which disrupts the GH ligaments and thus alters GH and scapulothoracic kinematics.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="bibr15-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="bibr16-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="bibr25-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="bibr28-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">28</xref></sup> Not only does this methodology alter the intricate interaction of the GH ligaments during motion, it decompresses the stabilizing benefit of concavity compression and it subjugates the GH motion with the effects of gravity. Additionally, manual manipulation of the shoulder during testing can introduce variability, and discontinuous motion analysis can lead to significant artifact and error.</p><p>In this investigation, the effect of posterior capsular contracture during passive ABD of an intact cadaveric shoulder was investigated through a simulated plication.

Our results demonstrate significant decrease in anterior and lateral forces measured at the load cell in the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral directions during ABD, suggesting increased compression, or load, at articulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2325967115599347">Figure 4, A-C</xref>).

While there was a maximum at 60&#x000b0; and 100&#x000b0; of ABD&#x02014;the beginning and end of the motion&#x02014;the contact pressure decreased until it reached a minimum at 80&#x000b0; before climbing again to 100&#x000b0;. This trend may illustrate the interplay of the humeral head&#x02019;s ovoid geometry the ABD angle and subacromial pressure.</p><p>Similarly, Poitras et al<sup><xref rid="bibr39-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">39</xref></sup> found that tightening the posterior capsule did not increase the subacromial contact pressure when loaded in discrete static steps. While our data were captured continuously, the findings are consistent with their claim that increased tightness of the posterior capsule does not cause an increase in subacromial contact pressure when the scapula is fixed (rigid).</p><p>As with any cadaveric model, this study has limitations. First, 6 shoulders represents a relatively small sample size. Despite this shortcoming, the observed trends in contact pressures and compressional forces were present throughout, as was the absolute displacement relative to arm position. In this study, 6 healthy, male, left shoulders were evaluated, but comparisons were not made to the contralateral limb. In the literature, 6 specimens have provided adequate insight.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr7-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="bibr36-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">36</xref></sup>
</p><p>Second, the precision of the measurements of the GH displacement depends on the reliability of the specimen&#x02019;s calibration. Because this process highlights individual anatomic landmarks on each specimen, there is inherent variability because they are landmarks rather than discrete points.<sup><xref rid="bibr6-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> The cadaveric shoulders offer a representation of the material and mechanical characteristics observed in vivo.<sup><xref rid="bibr27-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></sup>
</p><p>With the scapula rigidly fixed, each specimen&#x02019;s range of motion was limited 40&#x000b0; of ABD. While the model affords the opportunity to examine various motion patterns, this investigation focused on ABD to best understand the interplay of GH motion, scapular kinematics, and subacromial impingement. Moreover, the effects of rotator cuff forces were not replicated in this passive model. Their relevance in extreme ranges of motion has not been questioned.<sup><xref rid="bibr21-2325967115599347" ref-type="bibr">21</xref></sup> The results and conclusions of this study should be interpreted with caution. Our system is capable of simulating gross motion through elevation, rotation, and spatial translation of anatomical landmarks. However, in vivo ABD represents a complex interaction of muscles acting over various joints in concert, making the individual contributions of various factors difficult to predict. However, this testing system offers a model of ABD that accurately represents the current clinical test for impingement.</p><p>Future investigations would benefit from dynamic rotator cuff loading during ABD as well as controlled scapulothoracic motion. These additions may help provide a comprehensive understanding of shoulder kinematics by more accurately simulating in vivo motion.</p><p>In this study, the scapula was rigidly held to isolate GH motion during ABD of the humerus. Posterior soft tissue plication did not alter GH motion and, as a result, no significant change in subacromial contact pressure was observed. Suture plication constrained the joint&#x02019;s motion, drawing the humeral head closer to the glenoid, increasing the load at the articulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4-2325967115599347">Figure 4C</xref>). These findings suggest that a posterior capsular contracture may cause increased subacromial contact pressure (impingement) due to compensatory change in scapulothoracic motion rather than a change in GH motion. Future studies with an intact shoulder and mobile scapula are needed to address this concern.</p><p>This investigation demonstrates that posterior capsular plication increases the axial load on the shoulder joint during ABD. While a significant difference from baseline was observed in the plicated condition, posterior capsular plication did not change GH motion or subacromial contact pressure significantly. In future studies, the effects of physiologically relevant peripheral musculoskeletal forces may offer greater insight into how a posterior capsular plication changes the shoulder&#x02019;s motion to increase subacromial forces. Clinicians will benefit from this understanding of GH mechanics, which will help patients with shoulder pain and outlet impingement.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="equal" id="fn1-2325967115599347"><p>B.H., M.T.W., and N.P. contributed equally to the work; A.J.R. and A.N. contributed equally as senior authors to the work.</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict" id="fn2-2325967115599347"><p><bold>Declaration of Conflicting Interests:</bold> One or more of the authors has declared the following potential conflict of interest or source of funding: The authors would like to acknowledge the Medical Advisory Committee for Major League Baseball (A.N. and A.J.R.) and the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center for providing funding for this study.
