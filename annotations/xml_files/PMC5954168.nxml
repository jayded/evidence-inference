Outcome measures were timed from the 2-yr biopsy using a landmark approach.</p></sec><sec><title>Results and limitations</title><p>A 2-yr biopsy was performed in 312/843 patients. One hundred and seventy-seven patients were included in the per-protocol group with median follow-up of 7.8 yr from biopsy. Median PSA at biopsy was 0.5&#x000a0;ng/ml. Sixty-four bPFS events were reported: 46/145 (32%) in patients with negative, 6/18 (33%) suspicious, and 12/14 (86%) positive biopsies. A positive biopsy was prognostic of worse bPFS, going forward, compared with negative and suspicious biopsies, hazard ratio (HR)&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;4.81 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.50&#x02013;9.26, <italic>p</italic>&#x000a0;&#x0003c;&#x000a0;0.001).

PSA values at 2 yr between 1.01&#x000a0;ng/ml and 2.09&#x000a0;ng/ml were also associated with subsequent PSA failures (HR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.71, 95% CI: 1.98&#x02013;3.71), bPFS events (HR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.45, 95% CI: 1.81&#x02013;3.32), and prostate cancer-specific survival (HR&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2.87, 95% CI: 1.08&#x02013;7.64) compared with PSA &#x02264;1.0&#x000a0;ng/ml.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Two-year postradiotherapy prostate biopsies have limited value in patients with PSA control but both positive biopsy and higher PSA status are strongly associated with future bPFS events.

We observed significantly poorer PCSS in patients with positive 2-yr biopsies with HR of 15.6 and 9.8 in the PPG and LPG groups, respectively; however, our evidence is limited due to the small number of deaths (4/27 in PPG group), which probably relates to case selection for biopsy excluding patients with early PSA failure. Nevertheless, the data is in accord with Zelefsky et al <xref rid="bib0220" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> who demonstrated a three-fold increase in the rate of deaths from prostate cancer after 10-yr follow-up after a positive biopsy in intermediate- or high-risk prostate cancer patients treated with RT.</p><p id="par0190">We noted that early biochemical failure correlates with a higher positive biopsy rate when compared with the general PPG; this could be attributed to early local recurrence reflecting more aggressive tumours. We also observed that biochemical failure does not always correlate with positive biopsies as 27/46 (59%) of cases with biochemical failure in the EG had negative biopsies. This is probably due to the development of extra-prostatic recurrence as the cause of PSA failure or, alternatively missing the recurrent focus of tumour during biopsy, yielding false-negative results.</p><p id="par0195">PSA values at 2 yr were significantly correlated with biopsy outcomes, bPFS, PCSS, with PSA &#x0003e;1&#x000a0;ng/ml associated with a 2.7 higher chance of future biochemical failure than PSA &#x02264;1&#x000a0;ng/ml.
