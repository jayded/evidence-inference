Participants are randomly allocated to receive fixation with either an intramedullary nail or a distal locking plate. Measurements (EuroQol 5 Dimensions, Dementia Quality of Life, Disability Rating Index) are collected at baseline, 6&#x000a0;weeks and 4&#x000a0;months. The recruitment rate will be assessed across seven participating centres over a total of 52 centre-months which is expected after 10&#x000a0;months of recruitment. Objectives are &#x02013; feasibility phase, to assess recruitment rate and completion rate of the primary outcome measure; process evaluation, to assess the generalisability and likely success of a future trial; definitive trial, quantify and draw inferences on observed differences in health-related quality of life at 4&#x000a0;months between the study intervention groups (nail versus plate). A favourable opinion was granted by the Wales Research Ethics Committee (16/WA/0225), study-wide NHS approval was given by the Health Research Authority (IRAS 206745), and participating NHS trusts provided local approvals.

They account for 5% of all fractures of the femur with an estimated incidence of 10 per 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The optimal management of these fractures remains controversial. There is a bimodal distribution of the incidence of these fractures with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. The majority, approximately 85%, are fragility fractures sustained by older-aged patients after a fall from a standing height, the remainder are typically sustained by multiply injured patients after massive trauma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">There has been very little research exploring treatment options for distal femoral fractures in this population. A recent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] found few trials in this area, most of which compared outdated implants, such as non-anatomic, non-locking plating systems or earlier-generation nails. Furthermore, important limitations in the methodology of each of the trials were identified leading to substantial risks of bias. It was suggested that in order to optimise patient functional recovery following this debilitating injury &#x02018;a well-designed, adequately powered, randomised controlled trial comparing modern treatments is required&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par12">It is current practice to manage displaced fractures with operative fixation if the patient is medically fit enough to undergo surgery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Surgery reduces the substantial complications associated with non-operative treatment, such as prolonged immobilisation and bed rest, as well as the problems of non-union and mal-union [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par13">Since the operative treatment of these fractures was popularised, there has been a wide variety of implants employed to achieve fixation. The two interventions most commonly used in UK practice are intramedullary fixation with a locked, retrograde nail (nail), and extramedullary fixation with an anatomical, angular stable plate (locking plate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Nails offer twin theoretical advantages; the mechanical impact of a long, intramedullary device that is close to the axis of the femur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] and the biological advantages of minimum disruption of the fracture site and stimulation of blood supply through reaming [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. However, nails provide only limited options for distal locking screws, as all screws must pass through the centre of the nail, so the stability of the bone-implant construct may be sub-optimal. Locking-plate fixation has been facilitated by recent advances in implant technology that allow the screws to be screwed into the bone as well as the plate itself (&#x02018;locked&#x02019;). This produces a &#x02018;fixed-angle&#x02019; bone-plate construct. These plates were designed specifically for use in osteoporotic bone, and have been shown to exhibit excellent biomechanical properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, they are more expensive than nails and require larger surgical wounds to apply.</p><p id="Par14">There are few clinical data available to guide clinicians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], and it is clear that there is no current consensus concerning the best management of these injuries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We performed a multicentre retrospective study to review the current management of distal femoral fractures at four UK major trauma centres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. We found that only two devices are now used for fixation &#x02013; retrograde nails and locking plates. This retrospective study illustrates the patient demographics, the variability in treatment of these fractures in the UK and the considerable morbidity associated with the injury.</p><p id="Par15">Some studies suggest that there may be an important difference in outcomes following the choice of surgical management of these patients. The mean benefit of a nail over locking plates may be as great as 0.12 in EQ-5D-derived utility scores (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.019) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The minimum clinically important difference for EQ-5D is estimated to be 0.08 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Similar effect sizes are demonstrated in other measures of function and quality-of-life, such as the Glasgow Outcome Scale (extended) and the 12-item Short Form Health Survey (SF-12) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. These findings have also been reported by other groups. A small pilot study in the US comparing these technologies found some evidence of a similar benefit in quality of life in favour of nails (mean difference EQ-5D 0.1, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.07) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p id="Par16">We propose to conduct a feasibility study for a later, definitive randomised controlled trial comparing functional outcome after treatment with modern intramedullary nails or anatomical locking plates for fractures of the distal femur.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p id="Par17">The objectives of the TrAFFix study are to:<list list-type="order"><list-item><p id="Par18">Assess the feasibility of a future definitive trial</p></list-item><list-item><p id="Par19">Perform a process evaluation to understand the generalisability and likely success of a future trial</p></list-item></list>

Some patients may be unconscious, all will be distracted by the injury to their lower limb and its subsequent treatment and all will have had large doses of opiates for pain relief, potentially affecting their ability to process information. Similarly, patients&#x02019; next-of-kin, carers and friends are often anxious at this time and may have difficulty in weighing the large amounts of information. In this emergency situation the focus is on obtaining consent for surgery (where possible) and informing the patient and any next-of-kin about immediate clinical care.</p><p id="Par36">The consent procedure for this trial will reflect that of the surgery, with the clinical team assessing capacity before taking consent for the surgical procedure and this capacity assessment then being used to decide on the proper approach to consenting to the research. Conducting research in this &#x02018;emergency setting&#x02019; is regulated by the <italic>Mental Capacity Act 2005</italic> (MCA). We propose to act in accordance with section 32, subsection 9b of the MCA following a process approved by the relevant research ethics committee; where the clinical team advise that prospective patient consent is appropriate, this will be sought by the research team. If the clinical team advise that prospective patient consent is not appropriate, the research team will approach an appropriate consultee.</p><p id="Par37">Where a personal consultee is available, they will be provided with the study information and their written agreement recorded where given. Where a personal consultee is not available then an appropriate nominated consultee will be identified to advise the research team. The nominated consultee will be asked to agree for the patient to be randomised; this agreement will be prospectively recorded during the electronic randomisation process.</p><p id="Par38">For those patients who did not prospectively consent, or who had a nominated consultee give prospective agreement, the research associate will provide the patients with all of the study information at the first appropriate time when the patient has regained capacity. For those patients with capacity who did not consent prior to surgery and still lack capacity after their surgery, a personal consultee will be contacted to advise the research team about the patient&#x02019;s continued participation in the study. Written consent or agreement for continued participation in the study will be recorded.</p><p id="Par39">As part of the initial consent process patients and their personal consultees will be asked whether they may be approached about participating in interviews with regards their views on participating in this trial. A researcher from the TrAFFix team will identify which patients will be approached for interview, from those who agree to be approached. Participants who agree to be approached for interview will have a separate informed consent discussion for the interviews with a member of the research team either in person, by phone, or by post and where given their written or oral consent will be recorded. Conversations between researchers and patients or personal consultees may be audio-recorded as part of the process evaluation. This may include the initial discussion about TrAFFix before informed consent for the main study has been give. Where audio-recording may be acceptable and appropriate, local research staff will explain the rationale for the process evaluation and recording of the conversation and ask patients whether the conversation can be audio-recorded. Where patients agree, their verbal consent will be recorded at the start of the recording.</p><p id="Par40">Responsibility for recording and dating both oral and written informed consent or agreement will be with the investigator, or persons delegated by the investigator, who conducted the informed consent discussion. If a participant withdraws from the study, data collected up until the point of withdrawal will be included in any subsequent analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Randomisation and blinding</title><p id="Par41">Patients will be enrolled and randomised using a secure online system provided by the Oxford Clinical Trials Research Unit. Randomisation will be on a 1:1 basis, stratified by participating hospital and by whether, in the opinion of the clinical care team, the patient has chronic cognitive impairment. Participants will be randomly allocated to fixation using either intramedullary nailing or locking-plate fixation.</p><p id="Par42">As the surgical scars are clearly visible the patients cannot be formally blinded to their treatment, but will only be informed of their allocated treatment if requested at the end of the trial.
