RA represents a significant health and socioeconomic burden, and affects all domains of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), in particular physical functioning, pain, fatigue and physical and emotional roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], which patients report are more important to them than joint counts and laboratory tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Both the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency emphasize that patient-reported outcomes (PROs) selected for evaluation in a randomized controlled trial (RCT) should be targeted to the specific patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. The Outcomes Measures in Rheumatology (OMERACT) international consensus effort recommends use of disease-specific and generic instruments to assess physical function, HRQoL and fatigue in RCTs in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>The goal of therapy should be to use a treat-to-target strategy to achieve remission, if possible, or low disease activity, while limiting joint destruction, maintaining physical function and optimizing HRQoL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Standard-of-care treatment includes conventional nonbiologic and/or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (cDMARDs and bDMARDs, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Patients who do not achieve remission, or low disease activity with advanced disease, with methotrexate and/or other cDMARDs are often escalated to treatment with bDMARDs (often in combination with cDMARDs), including cytokine inhibitors (tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin (IL)-6 inhibitors, IL-1 inhibitors), B cell inhibitors and B-T cell co-stimulation modulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. As not all patients respond adequately to these medications, an unmet need for additional therapies persists, including those with alternative mechanisms of action.</p><p>Tofacitinib is an oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor which preferentially inhibits signaling by heterodimeric receptors associated with JAK3 and/or JAK1, with functional selectivity over those that signal via pairs of JAK2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>Administration of tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg orally twice daily (BID) has demonstrated sustained efficacy with a manageable safety profile in patients with RA in phase 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] and phase 3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>] RCTs of up to 24&#x000a0;months&#x02019; duration, and in long-term extension studies for up to 7&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>The phase 3 ORAL Solo RCT (A3921045) was designed to assess the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib monotherapy in patients with active RA, who had prior inadequate responses to cDMARDs or bDMARDs. The primary efficacy (including HAQ-DI) and safety data have been reported elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], and showed that tofacitinib monotherapy results in reductions in signs and symptoms of active RA including improvement in physical function, with a manageable safety profile over 6&#x000a0;months.

Further improvements occurred through month 6 in patients receiving active treatment, and similar changes from months 3&#x02013;6 were reported by placebo patients who switched to tofacitinib (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It has been demonstrated that PROs provide quantitative data of comparable value to more traditional measures (e.g., joint counts and laboratory tests), discriminate treatment effects, are easy to perform, and are important for long-term health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. Furthermore, HRQoL measures are unique in that they measure the impact of the underlying disease, treatment-related benefits and adverse effects, and offer the opportunity for comparison to other disease populations. PROs, clinical assessments and imaging of joints are all important in assessing RA patients and their responses to treatment, and should be utilized together to provide a holistic view of disease activity and wellbeing.</p><p>In this phase 3 trial, DMARD-IR patients receiving tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg BID monotherapy reported statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in PtGA, Pain, HAQ-DI, HRQoL, and fatigue at 3&#x000a0;months, with significant changes versus placebo observed at the first time point measured post-baseline, as early as 2&#x000a0;weeks. This is particularly important as patients were expected to have active disease at the time they initiated protocol treatment. In those patients continuing tofacitinib therapy, further improvements in LSM values were reported at month 6, and improvements in LSM values were greater for 10 versus 5&#x000a0;mg BID. Placebo patients who switched to tofacitinib at month 3 reported improvements through month 6, confirming the results of the primary analysis at 3&#x000a0;months. Benefits of treatment with tofacitinib, as demonstrated by these PROs, were consistent with primary efficacy data, which showed statistically significant improvements in ACR responses, and changes from baseline in HAQ-DI with tofacitinib 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg BID monotherapy versus placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Improvements in PtGA, Pain, and HAQ-DI with tofacitinib versus placebo were similar, and consistent with changes reported for fatigue and HRQoL. Across all five of these PROs &#x02013; PtGA, Pain, HAQ-DI, SF-36 PCS, and FACIT-F &#x02013; the proportion of patients reporting improvements&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;the MCID ranged from 61&#x02013;73&#x000a0;% for 5&#x000a0;mg BID and 65&#x02013;77&#x000a0;% for 10&#x000a0;mg BID. Improvements in LSM changes from baseline to months 3 and 6, and from 3 to 6&#x000a0;months in placebo patients switched to tofacitinib, were consistently greater for 10&#x000a0;mg BID versus 5&#x000a0;mg BID. Across these five PROs, the NNT values for treatment with 10&#x000a0;mg BID ranged from 3.2&#x02013;5.0 compared with 4.0&#x02013;6.1 for 5&#x000a0;mg BID, with such low numbers reflecting the value of therapy to patients.</p><p>In active RA, physical functioning, pain and fatigue have been shown to be important outcomes from the patient&#x02019;s perspective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] Tofacitinib therapy resulted in improvements in each of these aspects of the disease, measured by PtGA, Pain, HAQ-DI, FACIT-F, and the MOS Sleep Scale. Benefits of tofacitinib treatment were rapid in onset and significant improvements were reported at week 2 for PtGA, Pain, and HAQ-DI, and differentiation from baseline was seen as early as 3&#x000a0;days after treatment initiation for IVRS PtGA and IVRS Pain.</p><p>As expected, patients reported substantially diminished HRQoL at baseline, measured by SF-36, versus age- and gender-matched US normative data as a benchmark comparison (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). This was particularly evident in the PF, RP, BP, GH, SF, and RE domains, consistent with the broad impact of active RA on physical, social, emotional, and mental functioning. Following tofacitinib treatment, patients reported statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in both summary scores and all domains of the SF-36 with both tofacitinib doses.</p><p>Statistically significant and clinically meaningful improvements in the VT domain resulted in scores that approached (5&#x000a0;mg BID) and met (10&#x000a0;mg BID) normative values from the US general population at month 3. These are reflected by improvements in the FACIT-F scores, which were statistically significantly greater versus placebo, and exceeded the MCID. Not only were changes from baseline greatest in those domains with the lowest scores at baseline (PF, RP, and BP), but improvements were also evident in other domains, including RE and MH, which correlate strongly with the classic instruments used to diagnose clinical depression. RA is known to have a major negative psychological impact, with depression occurring in 13&#x02013;20&#x000a0;% of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>] or more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>] based on clinical assessments. Thus, it appears that tofacitinib not only improves physical functioning, pain and fatigue, but also social and emotional functioning and wellbeing.</p><p>Patients receiving placebo monotherapy improved at 3&#x000a0;months, although mean improvements were small in magnitude: below the MCID in the HAQ-DI and FACIT-F, and meeting the MCID in the PtGA, Pain, and PCS scores. Fewer than 50&#x000a0;% of placebo patients reported changes the MCID (43&#x02013;48&#x000a0;%) in all PRO endpoints compared with &#x02265;61&#x000a0;% and &#x02265;68&#x000a0;% in the 5 and 10&#x000a0;mg BID groups, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This phase 3 randomized clinical trial, ORAL Solo, demonstrates that treatment with tofacitinib monotherapy for 3&#x000a0;months provides relief from the broad burden of active RA, favorably impacting a wide range of PROs. These include self-assessment of physical function, pain, disease activity, and HRQoL, with low NNT and early onset of improvement in patients with a prior inadequate response to cDMARDs and/or bDMARDs.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13075_2015_825_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Ethical review boards and study centers.
