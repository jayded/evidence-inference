SIRT could be repeated once in case of recurrence; while, TACE was repeated every 6&#x000a0;weeks until no viable tumor tissue was detected by MRI or contraindications prohibited further treatment.

Its incidence is still rising, mainly due to the increasing numbers of Hepatitis B (HBV) and C virus (HCV) infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Unfortunately, the majority of patients are diagnosed in intermediate or advanced clinical stages excluding them from potentially curative treatments like resection, transplantation, or local ablation. According to the barcelona clinic liver cancer classification (BCLC), patients with intermediate stage HCC (BCLC stage B) should undergo transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In intermediate stage HCC, TACE has a proven survival benefit compared to the best supportive care with 1- and 2-year survivals of 82 and 63&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Precision-V study has defined a standardized embolization technique with drug eluting beads compared to the variety of different conventional TACE protocols reported in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>During the last few years, selective internal radiotherapy (SIRT), also referred to as radioembolization, was introduced for HCC as a second-line therapy in case of TACE failure. One of its main advantages is the reduced number of treatments needed; therefore, SIRT has potential as a first-line therapy for patients with intermediate stage HCC (BCLC stage B) despite its slightly higher costs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Our impression is that the reduced number of treatment sessions and the small size of the embolization particles preserve patency of the tumor feeding arteries. Since this maintains direct access to the tumor vessels, another local treatment, e.g., TACE, could still be performed as a second-line treatment in case of SIRT failure. Randomized data for HCC treatment using SIRT are not currently available. The only reports on treatment results are retrospective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>], non-randomized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], or deal with feasibility of treatment in advanced HCC, dose-finding, and SIRT-associated complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The aim of this randomized pilot study was to investigate whether SIRT might compare with, or even have some advantages over, TACE for treating HCC.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p>This study was a prospective, single-center, randomized trial with two parallel treatment groups receiving either DEB-TACE or SIRT. The trial was conducted on the basis and principles of ICH-GCP and according to the Declaration of Helsinki in its revised version. The study protocol (including patient information with consent) and any substantial amendments were approved by the responsible Ethics Committee. The study is registered at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov">www.clinicaltrials.gov</ext-link> as NCT01798160. A literature review in 2010 provided papers on SIRT-associated complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>], feasibility of SIRT in advanced patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], and dose finding. The only studies describing the treatment results of SIRT are retrospective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] or non-randomized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>] and investigated an inhomogeneous patient collective not comparable to stage B patients according to BCLC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Therefore, we finally decided that a reliable power calculation is not feasible and label this study a pilot study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Patients</title><p>The final study population consisted of 24 patients, 12 in each group of patients (mean age in SIRT group 71.8&#x000a0;&#x000b1;&#x000a0;7.2&#x000a0;years, range, 58&#x02013;82&#x000a0;years; mean age in TACE group 70.5&#x000a0;years, range 59&#x02013;87&#x000a0;years). The SIRT group consisted of eight men and four women, the TACE group comprised ten men and two women. All patients suffered from histologically proven M0 N0 HCC. The indication for local tumor treatment was assessed by an interdisciplinary HCC-tumor board. All patients meeting the inclusion criteria and eligible for both SIRT and TACE were included (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>).

Gadolinium-DTPA (Magnevist<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Bayer Schering Pharma AG), 0.1&#x000a0;mmol/kg body weight, 2&#x000a0;ml/s, was administered by bolus injection (Spectris<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Medrad) for contrast.

Patients underwent preparative intervention with angiography of the hepatic artery and protective coiling of side branches (e.g., gastroduodenal artery, right gastric artery). Afterwards, 150&#x000a0;MBq <sup>99m</sup>Tc-MAA was injected into the liver arteries using the same catheter position chosen for the scheduled SIRT session. Calculation of the hepato-pulmonary shunt fraction and tracer distribution was evaluated with subsequent planar images and SPECT imaging (MAA-scan) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Patients were then discharged and re-admitted for SIRT.</p><p>SIRT was performed using resin-based <sup>90</sup>Y loaded microparticles (SirSpheres<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, Sirtex Medical). The activity and dose for <sup>90</sup>Y-SirSpheres<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> were calculated according to the body surface model as suggested by the REBOC expert panel [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. SIRT was performed in a lobar approach. In case of bilobar tumor spread, treatment was split in two sessions. In these cases, the first treatment was dedicated to the liver lobe with the greater tumor volume. Treatment of the contra-lateral lobe was scheduled after 4&#x000a0;weeks to preserve liver function. After each treatment, patients were monitored for 2&#x000a0;days. Follow-up visits were performed every 3&#x000a0;months until clinical endpoints were reached. In cases with local tumor progression and an absence of contraindications, SIRT could be repeated once according to the study protocol. In cases with contraindications, crossover to TACE was permitted. Patients with crossover from SIRT to TACE were not censored.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>TACE Procedure</title><p>TACE was performed using drug-eluting beads (DC Beads<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>, 100-300&#x000a0;&#x000b5;m, Terumo) loaded with a maximum dose of 150&#x000a0;mg Doxorubicin per session [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The beads were administrated super selectively at the level of segmental and subsegmental arteries until stasis was reached (embolization endpoint). In patients with multilocular tumor spread or bilobar disease preventing a selective approach, a less selective embolization technique was used and each session was limited to one liver lobe according to the discretion of the investigator. In those cases, the contra-lateral lobe was treated after 4&#x000a0;weeks. TACE was repeated every 6&#x000a0;weeks until no more viable tumor was detected by MRI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Then, follow-up visits were performed every 3&#x000a0;months until clinical endpoints were reached. In cases with local tumor progression and an absence of contraindications, TACE could be repeated. If contraindications appeared, crossover to SIRT was possible according to the protocol. Patients with crossover from TACE to SIRT were not censored. Follow-up was carried out every 3&#x000a0;months and included physical examination, blood tests, documentation of adverse-/serious adverse-events (AE/SAE), and MRI of the liver.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>Survival is not only limited by tumor progression, but also by deterioration of liver function as a result of the underlying liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the primary endpoint was progression-free-survival (PFS) as it includes local treatment effects as well as death by deteriorating liver function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Local tumor response was measured according to the modified criteria for response evaluation in solid tumors (mRECIST) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Overall survival (OS) is also influenced by secondary treatment strategies following SIRT/TACE failure; therefore, it was applicable as a secondary endpoint. Time to progression (TTP) and time-to-locally-non-treatable-progression (nTTP) were also calculated. The TTP was defined as the time at which progression was evident according to the definitions of mRECIST in follow-up MRI or CT (extrahepatic disease). The nTTP was defined as the time at which local tumor progression of the liver could no longer be treated with the assigned treatment regime (SIRT or TACE) because of contraindications (e.g., laboratory findings), technical problems (e.g., occluded access artery), and/or occurrence of an extrahepatic tumor, preventing a continued local treatment approach.</p><p>The causes of deaths were analyzed with respect to the clinical aspect of the patients, laboratory tests, and imaging data. Death due to tumor progression was determined when tumor load was considerably increased, with replacement of normal liver tissue and/or invasion of large vessels possibly associated with liver failure and/or significant extrahepatic tumor spread. Vice versa, death due to liver failure was determined when liver function decreased (e.g., extensive ascites and need for paracentesis, increasing bilirubin levels, and impaired coagulation status) in the absence of an increasing tumor load.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Statistical Analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis system (SAS<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>), Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc.) was used for analysis, which was purely exploratory. Statistical analysis was done by an independent statistician to avoid review bias. Primary and secondary outcome measures (PFS, OS, TTP, and nTTP) were compared using the log-rank test. Time-to-event data were analyzed by the Kaplan&#x02013;Meier method and descriptive statistics of all other parameters were provided. The null hypothesis was that there is no difference in PFS for intermediate stage HCC patients treated with DEB-TACE or SIRT.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec11" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec12"><title>Patient Characteristics</title><p>Between April 2010 and July 2012, thirty-two patients with intermediate stage HCC were screened for study inclusion. Seven of these patients were excluded due to poor liver function (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3), extrahepatic tumor spread in CT (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;3), and withdrawal of consent immediately before randomization (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1). Subsequently, 25 patients were randomized, 13 to SIRT and 12 to TACE treatment. One SIRT patient showed significant hepatopulmonary shunting in the MAA scan and had to be excluded from treatment. Thus, 12 patients were treated in each group. There were no cases lost to follow up. One patient in the TACE group underwent liver transplantation 7.5&#x000a0;months after randomization and was, therefore, censored (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).

The potential risk of vessel damage as a result of repetitive embolization in TACE seems to be considerably lower in SIRT due to its smaller particle sizes and the reduced number of treatment sessions. This, together with the much easier application in the right and left hepatic artery makes it very attractive for the patient compared to super-selective TACE procedures with longer intervention times and repeated hospital admissions. The study protocol was designed to provide data on local tumor response, treatment associated peri-interventional complications, and potential side effects concerning liver function and overall survival. The results of this study might provide potential study endpoints, sample sizes, and safety aspects for a confirmatory multicenter study. The inclusion and exclusion criteria reflect the spectrum of HCC patients at our University Hospital with some variation in tumor load (similarly distributed in both groups) and without impaired liver function. The TACE group served as the control according to the allocation rules of the BCLC scheme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The relatively small final sample size of 24 (2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;12) patients reflects a study limitation.</p><p>Current data suggested SIRT was a favorable second-line treatment for diverse tumors, including HCC, after failure of standard treatment regimens [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The results of this pilot study demonstrate no differences in the PFS and OS after SIRT and TACE and no significant statistical differences in TTP and nTTP. The median survival after TACE found in this study is comparable to reported survival data after DC-Bead TACE and represents typical clinical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, the reduced number of SIRT treatment sessions and hospital days might be a significant difference that reflects an advantage in terms of quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Another potential advantage of SIRT over TACE is the significantly reduced harm caused to feeding arteries. The preserved patency of the tumor feeders allows for repeated transarterial tumor treatment with any kind of method in case of tumor progression. However, in the current study, patients with tumor progression presented with reduced liver function that prohibited repeated SIRT. A small number of cases crossed-over to TACE, but without benefit in overall survival. In addition, a considerable number of patients presented with occluded feeder arteries after repeated TACE that prevented direct transarterial access to the tumor and repeated embolizations of any kind.</p><p>We were able to differentiate between deaths due to progressive liver failure versus tumor progression. In all patients, the cause of death was identified while considering the clinical course. Death was due to liver failure when liver function decreased without a respective increase in tumor load and vice versa. The cause of deaths in this study might impact future interventional techniques. The less selective application of SirSpheres at the level of lobar arteries has the advantage of ease and speed of application; in addition, it is an effective treatment of non-visible micro-nodules that otherwise might become evident as recurrences during follow-up, which typically occurs for patients treated with super-selective TACE. However, there is an increased risk for secondary liver failure when one or both liver lobes are treated unselectively. Our data demonstrated secondary liver insufficiency as the primary cause of death after SIRT; while, there were considerably more deaths due to tumor progression in TACE patients. Radiation induced liver disease (RILD) has already been reported within 2&#x000a0;months following SIRT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. In our patients, fatal liver insufficiencies occurred at 4, 8, 20, and 21&#x000a0;months after SIRT; however, it is not clear whether this was due to deterioration due to liver cirrhosis or to radiation induced toxicity beyond 2&#x000a0;months. Thus, further evaluations should examine whether a more selective SIRT application could reduce the incidence of liver failure. However, this would presumably result in a higher rate of local tumor progression in the non-treated liver segments, comparable to the super-selective TACE approach used. Nonetheless, this selective SIRT approach might require repetitive SIRT treatments.</p><p>In conclusion, this randomized pilot study suggests SIRT and TACE are equivalent in terms of progression-free survival, overall survival, and TTP in intermediate stage HCC patients. The lower rate of tumor progression in the SIRT group was nullified by a greater incidence of liver failure. The results of this analysis should aid future studies for clarifying treatment decisions, determining medical expenses and treatment costs, as well as supplementing the BCLC scheme.
