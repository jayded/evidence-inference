However, comprehensive mechanical debridement of sites with deep periodontal pockets is difficult to accomplish. This has led to the adjunctive use of antimicrobial agents delivered either systemically or locally. As the systemic use of antimicrobial agents may cause several side effects like hypersensitivity, resistant strains, and superinfections, their local administration has received considerable attention.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Local drug delivery systems allow the therapeutic agents to be targeted to the disease site. Thus, the dose can be minimized, reducing the systemic absorption and subsequent risk of adverse side effects. Higher concentration of a therapeutic agent can be attained in subgingival sites by local drug delivery compared with a systemic drug regimen.</p><p>For subgingival application, various antimicrobial agents have been tried, including tetracycline, metronidazole, and chlorhexidine, either on their own or in combination with scaling and root planing (SRP). Chlorhexidine is a highly effective antimicrobial agent that is extensively studied and shown to be effective as a mouthrinse[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and also as a subgingival irrigant. It shows broad spectrum of topical antimicrobial activity, substantivity, effectiveness, safety, and lack of toxicity.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Chlorhexidine is one of the most effective topical agents, which has long been used as an effective antimicrobial agent.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] The first sustained release dosage form of chlorhexidine diacetate for topical use was developed by Friedman and Golomb,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] which had shown effectiveness in reducing the periodontal probing depth, clinical attachment loss, and bleeding on probing.</p><p>India has a rich history of using plants for medicinal purposes. Turmeric (haldi), a rhizome of <italic>Curcuma longa</italic>, is a common antiseptic used in traditional system of Indian medicine. Curcumin (diferuloylmethane), the main yellow bioactive component of turmeric, has been shown to have a wide spectrum of biological actions.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Literature reports have shown that curcumin has anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities, suggesting its potential to be used as a subgingival agent.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Safety evaluation studies have indicated that both turmeric and curcumin are well tolerated at a very high dose without any toxic effects.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Also, it is more acceptable, inexpensive, and a viable option for common man. Thus, the present investigations evaluated and compared the efficacy of two local drug delivery systems containing 2% whole turmeric gel and 1% chlorhexidine (Hexigel) in patients with chronic periodontitis.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Aim and objective</title><p>To evaluate and compare the clinical effects of topical subgingival application of 2% whole turmeric gel and 1% chlorhexidine gel as an adjunct to SRP in patients suffering from chronic periodontitis.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Fifteen patients (12 males and 3 females, aged 21-55 years) suffering from localized or generalized chronic periodontitis[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] were selected from amongst those visiting the outpatient Department of Periodontology and Oral Implantology, National Dental College and Hospital, Derabassi (Punjab).</p><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Subject selection</title><sec id="sec3-1"><title>Inclusion criteria</title><p>

Various treatments have been used for it, yet traditional mechanical debridement to disrupt the subgingival flora and provide clean, smooth, and biologically compatible root surfaces is still the mainstay. Even though the outcome of mechanical debridement usually satisfies in terms of reduction in probing depth and bleeding on probing, difficulties reaching the bottom of the pocket can lead to its failure.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] As a consequence, supplementary treatment becomes inevitable. Moreover, it has also been demonstrated that the time spent on therapy, the number of sites that require instrumentation,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and the experience of the clinician may influence the success of SRP.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] These findings indicate that SRP is a technique-sensitive method for treating periodontitis. Furthermore, some microbiota simply cannot be mechanically eradicated. Indeed, bacterial invasion in cementum, radicular dentin,[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref><xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and the surrounding periodontal tissues[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref><xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] has been reported. The idea of subgingivally applying a highly concentrated antimicrobial agent as an adjunct to SRP was to compensate for the shortcomings of the former, thereby improving the treatment outcome. Chlorhexidine has long been the gold standard for subgingival chemical plaque control regimens.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Its efficacy as a topical rinse to inhibit dental plaque and gingivitis has been well established without evidence of development of any bacterial resistance.[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] It has been found to be effective against subgingival bacteria when delivered through a sustained release device. Chlorhexidine has been shown to be an effective agent in plaque inhibition[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] as it is well retained (substantivity) in the oral cavity. It is safe and is acceptable in terms of cost and ease of use.</p><p>However, it has various side effects like brown discoloration of teeth, dulling of taste sensation, and oral mucosal erosion. Therefore, a need was felt for an alternative antimicrobial agent that could provide a product already enmeshed within the traditional Indian setup and is also safe and economical.</p><p>Turmeric, more commonly known as &#x0201c;haldi,&#x0201d; possesses anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and antimicrobial properties along with antimutagenic and anticoagulant activities.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] It also accelerates wound healing.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Due to these reasons, it was felt that promotion of turmeric in dental terrain may prove beneficial.</p><p>In terms of taste and acceptance of turmeric gel, there was good biological acceptability without any side effects. It was simple and easy to use; also, its bioadhesive property allowed its better retention.</p><p>Hence, the aim of the present investigation was to evaluate and compare the clinical effects of topical subgingival application of 2% whole turmeric gel and chlorhexidine gel as an adjunct to SRP in patients suffering from chronic periodontitis.</p><p>Patients with a pocket depth of 5-7 mm in at least three non-adjacent sites in different quadrants of the mouth were selected. This was in accordance with Goodson[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] who pointed out that successful control of periodontal microflora in pockets &#x02265;5 mm requires locally delivered antimicrobials reaching the site of action, that is, the periodontal pocket and its surrounding tissues, thus maintaining minimum effective concentrations for sufficient duration to produce a therapeutic effect.</p><p>Clinical parameters (PI, GI, probing depth, and relative attachment level) were recorded at baseline, 30 days, and 45 days in all three groups (Group I: 2% turmeric gel, Group II: 1% chlorhexidine gel, and Group III: SRP).</p><p>The results of the present investigation show that chlorhexidine gel as the local drug system in Group II was better than SRP alone in Group III. This could be attributed to the substantivity and antimicrobial property imparted by chlorhexidine. This finding is in accordance with the findings of the studies conducted by Unsal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Vinholis <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] who used 1% chlorhexidine gel in the treatment of periodontal pockets.</p><p>However, Group I (turmeric gel) showed comparable improvement in all the clinical parameters as Group II (chlorhexidine gel). These results suggest effective usage of turmeric gel as a potential local drug delivery system which could aid in the treatment of periodontal disease. It proved to be a more effective treatment modality than SRP alone, as demonstrated by the clinical parameters. These results are consistent with those reported by Behal <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Thus, results of the present study brighten the futuristic aspect of using turmeric gel as a local drug delivery system in subgingival sites. The limitation of the present clinical trial was the small sample size and the short duration for determining the efficacy of the experimental drug. Thus, further longitudinal studies are recommended with larger sample size for the evaluation of the efficacy of this herbal agent in the treatment of chronic periodontitis. The concomitant biochemical and microbial analysis could also help in better interpretation of findings.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Within the limitations of the present study, 2% whole turmeric gel as an adjunct to SRP proved to be effective in the treatment of periodontitis. The bioadhesive property of this local drug delivery system allowed better retention and was biologically accepted without any side effects. Moreover, it was simple to use and required less chairside time. So, it appears as a viable and an inexpensive option for common man and can be incorporated as a treatment modality in day-to-day life.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn
