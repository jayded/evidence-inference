While the benefits of supplemental oxygen, at least in non-hypoxaemic subjects, on exercise performance remains uncertain[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], substantial skeletal muscle hypoxia is observed during exercise in both normal subjects and COPD patients whose oxygen saturation is maintained by the administration of supplemental oxygen[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Taken together with other data which suggest that anaerobic metabolism is frequent in patients with COPD[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], a potential contributor to exercise limitation in COPD could be through the mechanism of tissue oxygen delivery, intramuscular oxygen transport or mitochondrial dysfunction. Thus approaches which reduce the oxygen cost of exercise might be of therapeutic benefit.</p><p>Both nutrient and oxygen delivery, as well as mitochondrial function (and thus oxygen consumption), are under regulatory control by the physiological signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO). NO is produced endogenously by the action of the NO synthase (NOS) family of enzymes via oxidation of the amino acid L-arginine. NO may also be produced by the reduction of exogenous dietary nitrate (NO<sub>3</sub>
<sup>-</sup>), found at high levels in beetroot and green leafy vegetables[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], to nitrite (NO<sub>2</sub>
<sup>-</sup>) and then further to NO in a NOS-independent manner[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p><p>Ingested nitrate is enterally absorbed into the blood, with approximately 25% of the circulating amount being taken up by the salivary glands (enterosalivary circulation). Nitrate is then excreted in saliva[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>], and reduced from nitrate to nitrite via the nitrate reductase activity of oral commensal facultative anaerobic bacteria[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Salivary nitrite is subsequently swallowed and may enter the circulation directly as nitrite[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], or be further reduced to NO and absorbed following oxidation to nitrite or nitrate.</p><p>Various studies have reported benefits from dietary nitrate supplementation through the mechanism of a reduction in the oxygen cost of submaximal exercise in young, healthy individuals[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and this has been associated with improved measures of exercise performance[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The majority of studies have used beetroot juice as the nitrate source, the oxygen-sparing effect being dependent largely on nitrate itself since nitrate-depleted beetroot juice fails to elicit the same effect[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. This effect has been shown to persist over at least 15 days of continual supplementation [<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p><p>A beneficial effect of nitrate supplementation has also been demonstrated during exercise in hypoxic conditions[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], which is of interest for people with chronic respiratory disease. Two early studies suggested benefit in patients with COPD [<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>], although both studies were limited by the placebo preparation selected, and other groups have failed to reproduce these findings using a robust placebo[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. However, in the two latter studies the dose of nitrate administered immediately prior to testing was below that which has been shown in health to induce improvement in exercise performance[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and in one case testing was performed only one hour post dosing[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] when nitrite levels may not yet have peaked. Thus these findings need further investigation with a higher dosing regimen given at an appropriate time interval prior to exercise testing, particularly since the studies failed to show any effect on blood pressure[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of a higher dosing regimen of nitrate, in the form of beetroot juice, on exercise performance in COPD with concomitant measurements of pulmonary oxygen uptake and with comparison to a robust placebo preparation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec007"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Patient selection</title><p>All participants provided written informed consent prior to enrolment in the study, which was approved by the Bromley Research Ethics Committee (reference 13/LO/0372) and conducted in line with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.

The principal investigator who was not involved in any patient visits held the randomisation list and indicated the patient assignment order.</p><p>We hypothesised that nitrate supplementation would increase time to exhaustion during symptom-limited cycle ergometry at 70% peak workload as assessed previously using an incremental, maximal, symptom-limited cardiopulmonary exercise test. Secondary outcome measures included plasma nitrate and nitrite levels, blood pressure response, area under the VO<sub>2</sub> curve to isotime, and plasma metabolomics.</p></sec><sec id="sec010"><title>Intervention</title><p>140ml of BEET-IT Sport Stamina Shot (James White Drinks, Ipswich, UK) containing 0.8g nitrate and 140ml of a matched placebo of beetroot juice specifically depleted of nitrate were used as the active and placebo preparations, respectively. The placebo preparation was identical in appearance and taste[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], and also produced beeturia. The dose chosen was intended to provide a bolus of nitrate (12.9mmoles) exceeding that necessary to reduce oxygen consumption during submaximal exercise in young healthy subjects[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and was selected as a convenient dosing method (2x 70ml bottles) which was readily acceptable and easily ingested.</p><p>Subjects were requested to avoid foods naturally high in nitrate in the 48hour period prior to the dosing visit and were asked to match food and caffeine consumption on the two days of testing. Subjects were additionally asked to avoid use of mouthwash and chewing gum in the 48hour period prior to testing as this has previously been shown to reduce oral bacterial nitrate reductase activity[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].

Following successful screening the subjects attended for measurement of baseline characteristics during which several parameters were recorded including vital signs, anthropometric and bioimpedance measurements, quality of life assessment, full pulmonary function testing, quadriceps maximal volitional contraction, physical activity monitoring, and an incremental maximal symptom-limited cycle ergometry test was performed.</p><p>On the dosing visits the subjects attended on the day of testing in the morning; after a 10 minute rest period blood pressure measurements and baseline plasma samples were obtained, after which the patients were dosed. 3 hours later both blood pressure measures and blood sampling was repeated prior to endurance cycle ergometry at a constant work rate (70% peak workload achieved on prior maximal incremental exercise testing). The cycle test was conducted at the same time on each occasion. Further blood draws were taken at peak exercise.

Subjects lay supine for 10 minutes prior to measurement. Electrodes were placed on the dominant hand and foot, at 2cm proximal to the carpometacarpal joint and the ulnar level of the wrist on the dorsal aspect of the hand, and at 2cm proximal to the carpometatarsal joint and level of the malleoli of the ankle respectively. The value obtained is dependent on body water content and based on this FFM can be calculated using a disease specific regression equation[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. Fat Free Mass Index (FFMI) was calculated by dividing FFM by height in metres squared (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Individuals with a FFMI below 16 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in males and 15 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in females were considered to have evidence of FFM depletion[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec013"><title>Physical activity measurement</title><p>Patients were asked to wear a physical activity monitor (SenseWear Pro Armband, Bodymedia, Pittsburg, USA) continually for a week that incorporates a biaxial accelerometer and energy expenditure measurements[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].

Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was utilised to compare plasma nitrate metabolites between treatment conditions and at each specific time-point. To compare oxygen consumption between study conditions, individual cardiopulmonary exercise test data periods were expressed as percentiles of isotime (the duration of the shorter of the two tests) and the individual responses grouped to allow analysis of VO<sub>2</sub> against percentage of isotime (plotted at the midpoint of each 10<sup>th</sup> percentile of isotime). The area under this curve was assessed for each subject and the two conditions, then compared using a paired t-test. Resting and isotime measurements between treatment conditions were compared using paired t-tests, or the appropriate non-parametric test for data that was not normally distributed. A p-value &#x0003c;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec021"><title>Results</title><sec id="sec022"><title>Subjects</title><p>25 patients were enrolled into the study, of whom 21 completed the full study protocol (<xref rid="pone.0144504.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>).

However that study, which also failed to show an effect on exercise performance, used a lower treatment dose of nitrate and achieved plasma nitrate levels that were 4-fold lower than our dosing regimen (215&#x000b1;84&#x003bc;M vs. 820&#x000b1;288&#x003bc;M). Previous work has established that both reduction in blood pressure and post-dose plasma nitrate levels are dose-dependent[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus an important conclusion of the current study is that a single higher dose of nitrate is both safe and biologically active in COPD.</p><p>The plasma nitrite levels fell below the limit of quantifiability in the majority of baseline samples. Part of the explanation for this, besides a small interfering peak apparently originating from the beetroot juice, is that samples were not pre-treated with a thiol-blocking agent prior to centrifugation; such treatment ensures there is no flux of nitrite across blood cell membranes, which may lower plasma concentrations. However, high levels of plasma nitrite were readily measurable following nitrate dosing.</p><p>We failed to observe an improvement in exercise performance following nitrate dosing, despite a reduction in the oxygen cost of exercise. There are several possible explanations for this. Firstly, this could be due to statistical power and variation in endurance time. The variability in endurance time at 70% maximal workload on endurance cycle ergometry was beyond what we have observed in previous studies in a similar population[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In part this may be explained by day-to-day symptom variability in COPD[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and might thus be an expected feature of studies in this condition using this outcome measure as has been reported by other groups studying nitrate supplementation in COPD[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. A trial run might have reduced this variability, although it is important to note no order effect was identified. Studies using cycle ergometry methodology and agents of proven efficacy (for example bronchodilators) have tended to have larger sample sizes than ours[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. Certainly, significant caution is needed when interpreting the results of non-blinded studies in this field, and emphasises the importance of using nitrate-depleted beetroot juice (which also causes beeturia) as a placebo[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>Secondly, it may simply be the case that this small improvement in the oxygen cost of exercise does not impact on the rate limiting parameters in exercise in ventilatory limited patients. Thirdly, we may have studied the wrong patient group. By design we did not include patients on oxygen supplementation but it may be the case that it is this specific patient phenotype where a reduction in the oxygen cost of exercise produces the greatest benefit.</p></sec><sec id="sec030"><title>Significance of the findings</title><p>While it is possible that a larger sample size might have given a positive result this seems relatively unlikely given exercise time was also numerically shorter in the treatment group. However, the observation (confirmed by the fall in blood pressure) that nitrate supplementation is biologically active and associated with a measurable reduction in oxygen consumption is of interest. Cardiovascular comorbidities are common in patients with COPD, so an intervention that lowers blood pressure may produce clinical benefit outside of a direct effect on exercise performance.</p><p>Some prior data are available regarding nitrate supplementation with beetroot juice in COPD. An improvement in endurance cycle ergometry exercise time has been previously noted in a randomised cross-over study[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, we believe that caution is needed in interpreting this result, partly because a matching placebo beverage (i.e. one which caused beeturia) was not used. This study as noted by the authors, also noted inter-individual variability in endurance time despite the use of a familiarisation constant work rate exercise test, and appropriate adjustment if the endurance time was outside of the 4&#x02013;10 minute range. In fact, some individual responses were of a greater magnitude than could be explained by a plausible biological mechanism, thus skewing the overall data for endurance time. Despite this, in line with our own study, a similar reduction in pulmonary oxygen uptake at isotime was noted (of the order of 0.7ml/min/kg), although this failed to reach statistical significance (p = 0.099) most likely due to under-powering[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This lends support to our own findings regarding the influence of nitrate supplementation on the oxygen cost of exercise.</p><p>Two further studies in COPD (both reported after we started our study) used a robust placebo but either failed to show a positive effect on oxygen consumption[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] or did not measure this variable[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], and both showed no improvement in exercise performance[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Effects on oxygen consumption have previously been shown to be dose-dependent[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>], and thus these negative findings may be due to the use of an insufficient dose of nitrate. Consideration should also be given to the fact that there are recognised &#x02018;responders&#x02019; and &#x02018;non-responders&#x02019; to nitrate supplementation when studying athletic populations[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Whilst the lack of response in elite athletes may in part be explained by intrinsic high levels of nitrate metabolites through both exercise induced upregulation of NOS activity[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and the selection of a diet rich in nitrate, the fact that within that group there is variability in response indicates that other unrecognised factors are likely at play[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our own study is too small to enable effective subanalysis but it should remain a focus of future studies to consider factors that may affect responsivity to nitrate loading, allowing those subjects most likely to benefit from nitrate supplementation to be both recognised and targeted.</p><p>The reduction of VO<sub>2</sub> at absolute isotime in our study is of a similar magnitude (3&#x02013;4%) to that recorded in healthy individuals[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. The cause of this observation is unclear, but of interest. Several potential modes of action of nitrate have been proposed including alterations to skeletal muscle blood flow[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>], improved efficiency of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>], effects on energy requiring processes in skeletal muscle[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0144504.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], alterations to mitochondrial biogenesis[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>], blood viscosity[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and NOS substrate availability[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. No significant changes were noted in any of the metabolites identified in the NMR spectroscopy array, and although lactate rose appropriately following the exercise challenge this was of equal magnitude in both conditions, suggesting, as in health, that nitrate does not promote anaerobic metabolism[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>Use of phosphorus-31 NMR spectroscopy have suggested that nitrate supplementation acts, at least in part, via reduced ATP cost of muscle force production[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. Separately we have recently demonstrated a trend towards longer ADP recovery times in COPD patients preselected for quadriceps dysfunction[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. The generation of ATP is dependent on the generation and maintenance of the electrochemical proton gradient. However, not all of this membrane potential is eventually coupled to ATP production due to proton leakage across the inner mitochondrial membrane, through uncoupling proteins and the adenine nucleotide translocase. Larsen <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>] demonstrated ex vivo that following 3 days of nitrate supplementation harvested human skeletal muscle mitochondria increased oxidative phosphorylation efficiency, correlating with a 3% reduction in whole-body oxygen consumption during submaximal workload exercise[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Future studies are clearly required to inform the mechanistic action of nitrate to allow the exploration of pharmacological therapies that may exploit the relevant pathways.</p><p>Although our data do not support a role for general use of nitrate supplementation using beetroot juice in this setting we believe, because of the observation of reduced oxygen consumption, that targeting specific phenotypes in COPD may lead to the identification of therapeutic benefits. Thus, for example, we are now conducting a trial to investigate nitrate supplementation as an adjunct to pulmonary rehabilitation (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN27860457">www.controlled-trials.com/ISRCTN27860457</ext-link>), powered to detect an improvement in incremental shuttle walking distance. Other possible feasibility studies could be those in patients stratified for lactataemia (indicating anaerobic metabolism) during exercise, or those with either systemic or marked local hypoxia (for example detected using near-infrared spectroscopy[<xref rid="pone.0144504.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]).</p><p>In conclusion, acute administration of 0.8g nitrate in the form of beetroot juice failed to improve endurance exercise cycle capacity compared with placebo, but the reduction in oxygen consumption during exercise in COPD subjects and the reduction observed in resting diastolic blood pressure confirm a biological action at this dose. Several studies have now confirmed the blood-pressuring lowering properties of nitrate administered as beetroot juice in COPD, and as comorbidities are common in this population this may be an important effect. Since the intervention is safe and inexpensive further studies are warranted to establish whether it has a therapeutic role in specific COPD phenotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec031"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0144504.s001"><label>S1 CONSORT Checklist</label><caption><p>(DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0144504.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0144504.s002"><label>S1 Trial Dataset</label><caption><p>(XLS)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0144504.s002.xls"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0144504.s003"><label>S1 Trial Protocol</label><caption><p>(DOCX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0144504.s003.docx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors wish to thank the lung function department at the Royal Brompton Hospital, Cosetta Minelli for her assistance with the statistical analysis, the NIHR Biomedical Research Unit, and the patients for their participation in this study.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>COPD</term><def><p>chronic obstructive pulmonary disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FFM</term><def><p>fat free mass</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NMR</term><def><p>nuclear magnetic resonance</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NO</term><def><p>nitric oxide</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>NOS</term><def><p>nitric oxide synthase</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0144504.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
