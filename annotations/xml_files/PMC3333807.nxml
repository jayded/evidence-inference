Twenty-three of the 25 patients had been taking antihypertensive drugs before aliskiren treatment, including calcium antagonists (16 patients), ACEIs (six patients), ARBs (18 patients), &#x003b2;-blockers (four patients), &#x003b1;-blockers (seven patients), &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blockers (four patients), and &#x003b1;-methyldopa (f ive patients). Among these 25 patients, 11 patients continued aliskiren treatment with their pre-existing antihypertensives including calcium antagonists (four patients), ARBs (seven patients), &#x003b2;-blockers (two patients), and &#x003b1;-blockers (three patients) during this study period (aliskiren group). Ten patients were withdrawn from aliskiren treatment from month 3 to month 8 (month 3, one patient; month 4, three patients; month 6, two patients; month 7, two patients; and month 8, two patients) owing to symptomatic hypotension. These ten patients had their BP controlled by antihypertensives other than aliskiren including calcium antagonists (eight patients), ACEIs (three patients), ARBs (eight patients), &#x003b2;-blockers (two patients), &#x003b1;-blockers (three patients), &#x003b1;&#x003b2;-blockers (four patients), and &#x003b1;-methyldopa (three patients) during this study period (aliskiren-withdrawal group).

The aliskiren-withdrawal patients showed re-upregulation of RAAS although their SBP and DBP were controlled at levels similar to those of the aliskiren group by antihypertensives, except for RAAS blockers. These results suggest that aliskiren significantly inhibited RAAS and had BP-lowering effects in hypertensive HD patients for the long-term. In addition, although statistical significance was not reached, which was considered to be due to the small number of samples, BNP (pg/mL) decreased from baseline (248.9 &#x000b1; 197.2) to month 2 (232.8 &#x000b1; 133.1) followed by a further decrease at month 20 (203.7 &#x000b1; 113.3) in the aliskiren group. On the other hand, in the aliskiren-withdrawal group, although BNP (pg/mL) decreased from baseline (425.3 &#x000b1; 207.3) to month 2 (409.5 &#x000b1; 287.8 pg/mL) with aliskiren treatment, it did not decrease from month 2 to month 20 (412.9 &#x000b1; 287.8 pg/mL) by withdrawal of aliskiren under similar levels of SBP and DBP as those of the aliskiren group. BNP reduction has consistently been associated with an improved outcome in heart failure.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijnrd-5-045">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21-ijnrd-5-045">21</xref> For instance, an increment of 10 pg/mL in BNP was associated with a 1.2% increased risk of death.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19-ijnrd-5-045">19</xref> Although we did not perform echocardiography to monitor the change of cardiac functions by aliskiren treatment during this period, these results suggested that both the aliskiren group and the aliskiren-withdrawal group may not exhibit worse cardiac functions. In addition, aliskiren might have cardioprotective effects in hypertensive HD patients. On the other hand, the oxidative stress marker d-ROM (U.CARR) showed a decrease from baseline to month 2 followed by a further decrease at month 20 in both the aliskiren group (386.6 &#x000b1; 123.1 (baseline) &#x02013; 356.3 &#x000b1; 120.5 (month 2) &#x02013; 305.6 &#x000b1; 67.4 (month 20)) and the aliskiren-withdrawal group (402.3 &#x000b1; 69.0 (baseline) &#x02013; 362.3 &#x000b1; 47.8 (month 2) &#x02013; 336.3 &#x000b1; 58.5 (month 20)). These results suggest that d-ROM may be decreased in association with BP lowering in hypertensive HD patients. Side effects of aliskiren including hyperpotassemia were not detected in any patients throughout the follow-up period in both the aliskiren group and the aliskiren-withdrawal group.</p><p>We previously reported that aliskiren was effective for BP control and inhibition of RAAS in hypertensive HD patients in the short-term, namely, by 8 weeks of analysis.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14-ijnrd-5-045">14</xref> Since the rate of discontinuation of aliskiren treatment (150 mg/day) owing to symptomatic hypotension was high (eleven of 25 patients) in this study, it may be better to reduce the initial dose of aliskiren to less than 150 mg/day, and careful observation for BP change is required for aliskiren treatment in hypertensive HD patients. Further studies including kinetic analysis of aliskiren will need to investigate the optimal dose of aliskiren in hypertensive HD patients. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that aliskiren is effective for BP control and inhibition of RAAS, which may lead to cardiovascular protective effects in hypertensive HD patients in the long term, although they need careful monitoring of BP change.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1-ijnrd-5-045"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>All authors report no conflicts of interest
