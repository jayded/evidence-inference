The dietary treatments were mulberry leaf pellet (MUP) supplementation at 0, 200, 400 and 600 g/hd/d with rice straw fed to allow <italic>ad libitum</italic> intake. All steers were kept in individual pens and supplemented with concentrate at 5 g/kg of body weight daily. The experiment was 4 periods, and each lasted 21 d. During the first 14 d, all steers were fed their respective diets <italic>ad libitum</italic> and during the last 7 d, they were moved to metabolism crates for total urine and fecal collection. It was found that increasing MUP levels resulted in linearly increasing rice straw and total intakes (p&#x0003c;0.05). Ruminal temperature and pH were not significantly affected by MUP supplementation while NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentration was increased (p&#x0003c;0.05) and maintained at a high level (18.5 mg/dl) with supplementation of MUP at 600 g/hd/d. Similarly, viable total bacteria in the rumen and cellulolytic bacteria were enriched by MUP supplementation at 600 g/hd/d. However, the rumen microbial diversity determined with a PCR-DGGE technique showed similar methanogenic diversity between treatments and sampling times and were similar at a 69% genetic relationship as determined by a UPGMA method. Based on this study, it could be concluded that supplementation of MUP at 600 g/hd/d improved DM intake, ruminal NH<sub>3</sub>-N, and cellulolytic bacteria thus iimproving rumen ecology in beef cattle fed with rice straw.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Mulberry Leaf Pellet</kwd><kwd>Microbial Population</kwd><kwd>Microbial Protein</kwd><kwd>Cellulolytic Bacteria</kwd><kwd>Rice Straw</kwd><kwd>Ruminant</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>INTRODUCTION</title><p>Mulberry (<italic>Morus alba</italic>) trees grow under varied climatic conditions, ranging from temperate to tropical, all over the world (<xref rid="b15-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Foiklang et al., 2011</xref>). The biomass yield of fresh leaves is often in the order of 25 to 30 tonnes/ha/yr with a cutting interval of about 9 to 10 wk, while leaves have high protein content (15.0% to 27.6% in DM) and high (75% to 85%) <italic>in vivo</italic> DM digestibility (<xref rid="b5-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Ba et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, mulberry leaves have a high potential as a protein-rich forage supplement for animal production. The mulberry leaves can be used as the main feed for sheep and goats (<xref rid="b3-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Bakshi and Wadhwa, 2007</xref>). Moreover, they have been used to replace concentrates in dairy cattle, goat, sheep, and swamp buffalo diets (<xref rid="b1-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Anbarasu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref rid="b20-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Kandylis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b15-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Foiklang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Ruminant production in many tropical regions is limited by poor-quality diets that are often deficient in nitrogen and have low digestibility which can limit the number of microbes (<xref rid="b25-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Orskov, 1994</xref>; <xref rid="b27-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Poungchompu et al., 2009</xref>). Dietary crude protein (CP) is the most costly nutrient and is generally divided into ruminally degradable protein (RDP) and ruminally undegradable protein (RUP). The RDP is considered essential for ruminal microbial growth (<xref rid="b44-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). This not only improves the ruminal fermentation but also ensures an adequate supply of microbial protein to the host animal which supplies 700 to 800 g/kg of the required amino acids to ruminants (<xref rid="b13-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Chumpawadee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b38-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Wanapat et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, supply of nitrogenous compounds to animals fed low-quality forages favors the growth of fibrolytic bacteria which increases digestion rates and microbial protein synthesis (<xref rid="b14-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Demann and McSweeney, 2006</xref>; <xref rid="b33-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Seo et al., 2010</xref>). Use of urea as a non-protein N (NPN) replacement is attractive in ruminant diets, because of its low cost compared with other protein feeds, such as SBM, with high rumen degradability (<xref rid="b36-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Wanapat, 2009</xref>; <xref rid="b43-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Xin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref rid="b10-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Cherdthong et al., 2011a</xref>,<xref rid="b11-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">b</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">c</xref>;). Urea is converted via ruminal ammonia into microbial protein, thereby supplying additional microbial protein to the host (<xref rid="b6-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Calsamiglia et al., 2008</xref>; <xref rid="b8-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Cherdthong and Wanapat, 2010</xref>). Since urea is cheap it could be used for tropical ruminant production, providing it is controlled to enable slow release and/or synchronized with soluble carbohydrate in the rumen, and should be of great value in improving N utilization. Adding urea-calcium mixture to a concentrate diet in beef cattle increased NDF digestion and microbial protein formation in the rumen (<xref rid="b10-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Cherdthong et al., 2011a</xref>).</p><p>Making a combination of cassava hay, soybean meal, urea and some binding agent in a pellet may be a suitable method to control urea release and provide a good source of RDP and RUP (<xref rid="b39-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Wanapat et al., 2006</xref>). Pelleting of corn-soybean meal based diets improved digestibility of most nutrients and energy, which indicated that the nutrient digestibility could be improved by a pelleting process (<xref rid="b46-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). However, combining mulberry leaves and protein sources with urea in a pellet have not yet been trialed as a protein source in ruminants especially when fed on rice straw. Therefore, mulberry leaf pellets (MUP; the pellet mixture of mulberry leaf powder, urea and some binding agent) were formulated and were their effects on feed intake, rumen ecology, microbial protein synthesis, and microbial diversity in beef cattle fed with rice straw were investigated.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Animals, diets and experimental design</title><p>Four, ruminally fistulated crossbred (Brahman&#x000d7;Thai native) beef cattle with 420&#x000b1;15 kg of body weight (BW) were randomly assigned to receive four dietary treatments according to a 4&#x000d7;4 Latin square design. The dietary treatments were as follows: supplementation with mulberry leaf pellets (MUP) at 0, 200, 400 and 600 g/hd/d, respectively.

Approximately 200 ml of rumen fluid was taken at each time from the middle part of the rumen using a 60 ml hand syringe. Ruminal pH and temperature were measured in the rumen using a portable pH temperature meter (HANNA, Instruments HI 8424 microcomputer, Singapore).

For each sample-derived standard, copy number concentration was calculated based on the length of the PCR product and the mass concentration. Tenfold serial dilution was made in Tris-EDTA prior to real time PCR. In total, 4 real time PCR standards were prepared. The conditions of the real time PCR assays of target genes were the same as those of the regular PCR described above.

It could be influenced by levels MUP (487 g/kg CP) as a protein supplement for beef cattle in this study. Similar findings have been reported by <xref rid="b29-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Salisbury et al. (2004)</xref> who found that DM intakes were increased at a result of protein supplementation.

In addition, rumen pH in the current results was not affected by MUP supplementation levels. Similarly, <xref rid="b23-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Mathis et al. (2000)</xref> found that supplementation of degradable protein did not affect on rumen pH. Peak times for NH<sub>3</sub>-N in the rumen were at 2 and 4 h post-feeding which could be explained by the high solubility of the protein sources used and the NH<sub>3</sub>-N levels was reduced extensively at 6 h post feeding. As in the present study, <xref rid="b28-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Ribeiro et al. (2011)</xref> evaluated ammonia-N releasing <italic>in situ</italic> from urea protected with polymers and found a NH<sub>3</sub>-N peak during the first hour after supplementation, and was reduced after 4 h post-feeding. Rumen NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentration tended to be increased linearly with increasing MUP supplementation diets and the averages values were 10.7, 13.6, 16.6, and 18.5 mg/dl for 0, 200, 400, 600 g/hd/d of MUP supplementation, respectively. In addition, a linear increase in ruminal NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentration was due to increasing dietary rumen degradable protein (RDP) level. A positive correlation between ruminal NH<sub>3</sub>-N and RDP has been reported by <xref rid="b19-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Javaid et al. (2011)</xref>. Moreover, increasing of NH<sub>3</sub>-N indicated higher levels of microbial activity or microbial protein synthesis (<xref rid="t5-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="table">Table 5</xref>). Notably, ruminal NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentration was highest on diets treatment with supplementation of MUP at 400 and 600 g/hd/d due to higher level of crude protein. Ruminal NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations tended to be increased in the MUP diet and higher than control at 0, 2, 4, 6 h post-feeding and were similar to results reported by <xref rid="b19-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Javaid et al. (2011)</xref> who found that protein supplementation altered ruminal NH<sub>3</sub>. In addition, NH<sub>3</sub>-N concentrations with the MUP diet were maintained at 13.6 to 18.5 mg/dl and these concentrations were well above levels recommended for optimal ruminal digestion (<xref rid="b32-ajas-25-4-452-2" ref-type="bibr">Satter and Slyter, 1974</xref>).
