This randomized controlled trial investigated the efficacy and safety of duloxetine in Japanese patients with diabetic neuropathic pain (DNP).</p><p><bold>Materials and Methods:&#x02002;</bold> Duloxetine 40 or 60&#x02003;mg/day or placebo was given orally once daily for 12&#x02003;weeks. The primary efficacy measure was weekly mean 24&#x02010;h average pain severity score on the 11&#x02010;point Numerical Rating Scale.</p><p><bold>Results:&#x02002;</bold> At 12&#x02003;weeks <italic>vs</italic> baseline, the 24&#x02010;h average pain score (adjusted mean&#x02003;&#x000b1;&#x02003;SE) was significantly improved in the combined duloxetine (&#x02212;2.47&#x02003;&#x000b1;&#x02003;0.18) and duloxetine 40&#x02003;mg (&#x02212;2.41&#x02003;&#x000b1;&#x02003;0.21) and 60&#x02003;mg groups (&#x02212;2.53&#x02003;&#x000b1;&#x02003;0.21) as compared with the placebo group (&#x02212;1.61&#x02003;&#x000b1;&#x02003;0.18). Duloxetine also exerted significant improvements over the placebo in nearly all secondary outcome measures including 24&#x02010;h worst pain, night pain, Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) pain scores, Patient&#x02019;s Global Impression of Improvement (PGI&#x02010;I) and health outcome measures, namely, various BPI interference scores. The incidence of adverse events (AE) was higher in the duloxetine groups than in the placebo group (duloxetine overall, 84.8%; duloxetine 40&#x02003;mg, 84.7%; duloxetine 60&#x02003;mg, 84.9%; placebo, 73.7%). Most AE were mild or moderate in severity, and resolved or relieved. There were no clinically significant safety concerns.</p><p><bold>Conclusions:&#x02002;</bold> Duloxetine 40 or 60&#x02003;mg/day showed superiority over the placebo at reducing pain scores in patients with DNP. Duloxetine is safe, efficacious and clinically useful in the management of DNP. This trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (no.

Taking into consideration that the present study was carried out in patients with moderate or severe DNP, duloxetine might contribute favorably to the treatment of such individuals.</p><p>Excluded from participating in the present study were patients complicated with psychiatric diseases including depression. Thus, the present findings support the argument that dual inhibition of reuptake of 5&#x02010;HT and NA in the CNS contributes to the independent analgesic effect of duloxetine.</p><p>DNP is typically characterized by the manifestation of peripheral pain in the extremities, which causes unbearable distress to patients. The most important matter for those with DNP must be to lessen the pain as early as possible. Duloxetine was found to significantly improve the 24&#x02010;h average pain score <italic>vs</italic> the placebo as early as 1&#x02003;week after starting treatment. Therefore, duloxetine might be useful for treating patients with DNP because of its early manifestation of an analgesic effect.</p><p>DNP is not only often increased at night and affects sleep<xref rid="b4" ref-type="ref"><sup>4</sup></xref>, but also interferes with daily life, leading to a lack of appetite and a depressive state in severe cases<xref rid="b5 b35" ref-type="ref"><sup>5,35</sup></xref>, and eventually to the deterioration of quality of life. Another important finding in the present study was that a significant improvement in health outcome measures was noted in the combined duloxetine group over the placebo for BPI average interference score as well as BPI interference of walking ability, relationships with other people, sleep and enjoyment of life. These clinical findings suggest that duloxetine might be helpful to improve patients&#x02019; quality of life.</p><p>From the practical point of view, dosing frequency is an important clinical consideration. A systematic review of associations between dosing frequency and medication compliance showed that the latter is inversely related to the former<xref rid="b36" ref-type="ref"><sup>36</sup></xref>. The dosing frequency of epalrestat and mexiletine hydrochloride, which are widely used for the treatment of DNP in Japan, is thrice daily, whereas that of pregabalin, which is approved and used in the USA and European&#x02010;approved pregabalin, is twice daily. Because we observed a significant improvement of DNP with the once&#x02010;daily regimen, this suggests that adherence to treatment with duloxetine might be less of a clinical concern.</p><p>Incidence of AE/ADR was significantly higher in the combined duloxetine group than the placebo group, whereas that in the 40 and 60&#x02003;mg groups was similar. In contrast, most AE and ADR reported in the combined duloxetine group were mild or moderate in severity and resolved or relieved. Because no clinically problematic findings were noted, it is considered that there are no safety concerns with duloxetine in the setting of DNP.</p><p>Our safety data are comparable to those observed in a previous clinical trial carried out overseas<xref rid="b19 b21" ref-type="ref"><sup>19,21</sup></xref>, where the incidence of AE on duloxetine was 87.7% (498/568 patients); major AE were nausea (23.6%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02003;=&#x02003;134 patients), somnolence (15.5%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02003;=&#x02003;88), dizziness (13.4%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02003;=&#x02003;76), constipation (11.3%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02003;=&#x02003;64) and insomnia (10.2%; <italic>n</italic>&#x02003;=&#x02003;58). Therefore, the type and incidence of AE in Japanese patients are similar to those in non&#x02010;Japanese patients. Furthermore, there was little difference in change of HbA<sub>1c</sub> between each duloxetine treatment group and the placebo, as was observed in studies carried out overseas; 13&#x02010;week treatment with duloxetine does not appear to adversely affect glycemic control.</p><p>In conclusion, the superiority of once&#x02010;daily dosing with the SNRI duloxetine <italic>vs</italic> placebo in improving DNP was shown in Japanese patients. Both 40 and 60&#x02003;mg daily dosages of duloxetine were safe and well tolerated.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ss14"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the following physicians for their cooperation in this research: Yasunori Iwashima (Yoshida Hospital); Katsuyuki Yanagisawa (Sapporo City General Hospital); Kenichi Tsuchida (Manda Memorial Hospital); Takashi Sasaki (Sasaki Naika Hospital); Kenichi Kimura (Naika Kimura Kenichi Clinic); Kenichi Yamada (Kenichi Yamada Clinic); Fuminobu Okuguchi (Okuguchi Clinic of Internal Medicine); Susumu Suzuki (Ohta Nishinouchi Hospital); Hiroaki Seino (Seino Internal Medicine Clinic); Koichi Kawai (Kawai Clinic); Takeshi Osonoi (Naka Kinen Clinic); Hiroshi Ohashi (Oyama East Clinic); Takashi Kikuchi (Kikuchi Naika Clinic); Hiroyuki Asano (Asano Naika Clinic); Taro Wasada, Masayo Kawano (Saiseikai Kurihashi Hospital); Aizan Hirai (Chiba Prefectural Togane Hospital); Toru Hiyoshi (Japanese Red Cross Medical Center); Yasuhiko Iwamoto (Tokyo Women&#x02019;s Medical University Hospital); Masahiro Sugawara (Sugawara Clinic); Masao Ohta (Nippon Medical School Hospital); Tamotsu Yokota (The Jikei University School of Medicine Hospital); Hiroyuki Tamura (Tokyo Kyosai Hospital); Makoto Sakurai (Sakurai Hospital); Yukiko Onishi (The Institute for Adult Diseases, Asahi Life Foundation); Sachihiko Ozawa (Minamino Clinic); Hisao Mori (Yokohama Sotetsu Bldg Clinic of Internal Medicine); Akio Ohta (St. Marianna University School of Medicine Hospital); Shiro Minami (Nippon Medical School Musashi Kosugi Hospital); Koichi Hirao (HEC Science Clinic); Masahisa Ori (Ori Clinic); Yukio Yamada (St. Marianna University School of Medicine, Yokohama City Seibu Hospital); Kumiko Hamano (Shonan Kamakura General Hospital); Tetsuo Nishikawa (Yokohama Rosai Hospital); Yasuo Terauchi, Mari Kimura (Yokohama City University Hospital); Hideaki Kaneshige (Hon&#x02010;Atsugi Medical Clinic); Ikuro Matsuba (Matsuba Clinic); Tetsuo Takuma (Takuma Saiwai Clinic); Keiko Arai (Arai Clinic); Takashi Iizuka (Asahi Internal Medicine Department Clinic); Kazuaki Yahata (Nagaoka Chuo General Hospital); Seiji Ogaku (Ogaku Clinic); Yukihiro Bando (Fukui&#x02010;ken Saiseikai Hospital); Mitsuo Imura (Yaizu City Hospital); Akira Yamauchi (Suruga Clinic); Takahisa Sano (Chubu Rosai Hospital); Masako Deguchi (Kyoto Second Red Cross Hospital); Hisataka Tegoshi, Atsushi Omoto (Kyoto First Red Cross Hospital); Kazuyoshi Nishino (Jujo Rehabilitation Hospital); Shizuo Kajiyama (Kajiyama Clinic); Shinya Makino (Osaka Gyoumeikan Hospital); Koichiro Yasuda (Saiseikai Noe Hospital); Shigeichi Shoji (Minami Osaka Hospital); Makoto Nomura (Osaka Rosai Hospital); Yasunao Yoshimasa (National Cerebral and Cardiovascular Center); Masayuki Hosoi (Osaka City General Hospital); Mika Fujimoto (Sakai Hospital Kinki University School of Medicine); Shinichiro Ohashi (Clinic Komatsu); Michiko Hayakawa (Hyogo Rehabilitation Center Hospital); Mitsuaki Kodama (Ikeda Hospital); Hiroyuki Konya (Hyogo College of Medicine Hospital); Konosuke Marui, Ryo Nagase (Okayama Rosai Hospital); Kenichi Shikata (Okayama University Hospital); Tetsuya Fukuda (The Sakakibara Heart Institute of Okayama); Fumiko Kawasaki (Kawasaki Medical School Hospital); Akihiko Nakamura (Osafune Clinic); Kiminori Yamane (Hiroshima University Hospital); Hiroyuki Nodera (Tokushima University Hospital); Tsuyoshi Oki (Omuta City General Hospital); Yasuhiro Sako (Saiseikai Fukuoka General Hospital); Shoichi Akazawa (Shinkoga Hospital); Katsumi Noda (Clinic Tenjinkita); Nobuyuki Abe (Abe Clinic); Yasuhiro Hashiguchi (Tempozan Naika Clinic).
