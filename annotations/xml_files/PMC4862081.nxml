The functional maturation of GIT occurs in both pre- and postnatal period, which is largely influenced by maternal nutrition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Maternal diet has been shown to affect the fetal development and organ function in mammalian animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Our recent study also suggests that maternal nutrition levels could affect the intestinal development and function, in which maternal over-nutrition would improve intestinal morphology, enzyme activities and gene expressions of nutrient transporters in newborn pigs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. However, it has been reported that maternal high-fat intake or &#x02013;related obesity could impair gut barrier, enhance gene expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in offspring intestine, thus predisposes offspring to inflammatory bowel disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the underlying mechanism for the effects of maternal high fat intake on the intestinal development and function are limited. The current study was designed to investigate the effects of maternal high fat intake on fetal intestinal development and function by measuring parameters on morphology, enzyme activities and transcriptional profiles. Oligo Microarray was used to analyze the genomic response of fetal intestine to maternal high fat intake. Pigs were chosen as the experimental animal, because it is generally accepted to be closer to humans than other laboratory or domestic animals in terms of gastrointestinal anatomy, physiology, nutrition and microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>The experimental procedure was approved by the University of Sichuan Agricultural Animal Care Advisory committee, and followed the current law of animal protection.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Animals and diets</title><p>A total of 8 Meishan (MS) gilts (aged at 266&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;15 d, initial body weight at 73&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;4&#x000a0;kg) were used in this study. After inseminated with MS semen, eight gilts were randomly allocated to receive control diet (CON diet with 14&#x000a0;% Protein, 34.7&#x000a0;% Starch and 2.8&#x000a0;% Fat) and high fat diet (HF diet with 14&#x000a0;% Protein, 34.7&#x000a0;% Starch and 7.3&#x000a0;% Fat), respectively. The 4.5&#x000a0;% of soy oil was added into CON diet to formulate HF diet, as a result, HF diet contained digestive energy (DE) at 3.0 Mcal/kg, while CON diet contained DE at 2.6 Mcal/kg. According to the fatty acids contents of feed ingredients by NRC (2012), the contents of saturated, mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids were 0.25&#x000a0;%, 0.48&#x000a0;%, 0.83&#x000a0;% in CON diet and 0.84&#x000a0;%, 1.78&#x000a0;%, 3.44&#x000a0;% in HF diet, respectively. The other nutrient levels were similar between 2 diets, meeting or exceeding nutrient requirements recommended by NRC (2012). All gilts were housed individually in stall (2.5&#x000a0;m length&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;1.6&#x000a0;m width), receiving the same amount of diets at 2.0&#x000a0;kg from d 1 to 30 of gestation and 2.5&#x000a0;kg from d 30 to 90 of gestation, with free access to water. Environmental temperature was maintained at approximately 24&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C during the experiment.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample collection</title><p>At d 90 of gestation, gilts were weighed (in average 128&#x000a0;kg at HF vs. 117&#x000a0;kg at CON group) and anaesthetized by intramuscularly injecting Zoletil 50 at the dose of 0.1&#x000a0;mg/kg (Virbac, France), then the uterus were removed from gilts. Two fetuses near the average fetal weight were collected each gilt. As the previous study, duodenal, jejunal and ileal samples (approximately 2&#x000a0;cm) were preserved in 4&#x000a0;% paraformaldehyde solution, then embedded in paraffin. Each tissue sample of duodenum, jejunum and ileum was used to prepare 5 slides, each slide had three sections (5&#x000a0;mm thickness), which were stained with eosin and haematoxylin, 20 well-oriented villi and crypts each section were measured for morphology (Optimus software version 6.5, Media Cybergenetics, North Reading, MA, USA), and villous height to crypt depth ratio (VCR) was calculated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. A section of duodenum, jejunum and ileum tissues were collected and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at &#x02212;80&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for analysis of enzyme activities, RNA microarray and gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Enzyme activities</title><p>According to the previous study, the thawing samples of jejunum and ileum were weighed (approximately 2 g), then 9 times volume of 50&#x000a0;mM Tris&#x02013;HCl buffer (pH&#x000a0;7&#x02009;&#x000b7;&#x02009;0) than the sample weight were added and homogenized for 40&#x000a0;s by homogenate machine (Homogenizer Power Gen 125&#x02122;, ThermoFisher Scientific, MA, USA) and centrifuged at 3000&#x000a0;g for 10&#x000a0;min, the supernatant was collected and stored at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Total protein was extracted from the supernatant and protein concentration was determined by bicinchoninic acid protein assay with bovine serum albumin as the standard (Solarbio, Inc., Beijing, China). Activities of disaccharidase including maltase, sucrase and lactase were measured using commercial kits (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering, Nanjing, China). The absorbance at 450&#x000a0;nm was determined with spectrophotometer (Beckman Coulter DU-800; Beckman Coulter, Inc., CA, USA). Activities of disaccharidase were presented as U/mg protein. One unit (U) was defined by 1&#x000a0;nmol of maltose, sucrose and lactose as a substrate for the enzymatic reaction, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>RNA extraction</title><p>The frozen ileum tissues were used for RNA extraction, 4 sections around luminal circle each tissue were collected and pooled for RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and quantified using spectrophotometry based on absorbance at 260&#x000a0;nm, the RNA quality was monitored using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).

Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. Microarrays were hybridized at 65&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C for 17&#x000a0;h and washed with a Gene Expression Washing Buffer Kit (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA).

It may be rational that the heavier birth weight needs higher lactase activity in preparation for better degradation of lactose, which is a crucial energy source in neonatal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. However, a recent study indicated that maternal high fat intake would induce intestinal inflammation and poor gut barrier function in the offspring of mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. In this study, porcine oligo miacro array analysis was used to determine the genomic response of intestine to maternal high fat intake, in an attempt to reveal the potential mechanism. According to the strict selection criteria, we found a total of 61 genes were differentially regulated and 64&#x000a0;% of them (39 genes) was down-regulated by HF diet. With the bioinformatics analysis, these down-regulated genes were mainly involved in process of immune response, signaling transduction, pathways in cancer and metabolism, suggesting the inhibitory effects of maternal high fat intake on certain biological events. The maternal diet fat composition could change the maternal-to-fetal fatty acid transfer and intestinal membrane n-6 and n-3 fatty acids composition of newborns, thus altering intestinal function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. In this study, therefore, it is rational that the addition of soy oil in maternal diet would induce alterations in intestinal physiology of fetus. Obviously, antigen processing and presentation in intestine could be inhibited by feeding HF diet, as indicated by the markedly decreasing gene expressions (i.e. SLA-1, SLA -DRB1, SLA-DQA1, CD74 and CD8, 1.5&#x02009;~&#x02009;2.5 fold reduction). Particularly, SLA-1, SLA -DRB1 and SLA-DQA1 are belonged to the highly polymorphic swine leucocyte antigen genes, which determine the immune response to disease and vaccine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. Among them, SLA-1 could interact with natural killer cells to prevent cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], while SLA-DRB1 and -DQA1 mainly present exogenous peptides for T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Previous studies have shown that maternal high fat intake impaired intestinal barrier and immune system through altering immune cell homeostasis, such as the number of T cells and macrophages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Furthermore, intestinal immune network for IgA production may be impaired by HF diet, as shown by the decreasing gene expression of CD40, IL-6 and TGF-&#x000df;. These genes are required for B cells proliferation and differentiation in Peyer&#x02019;s patches, their down-regulation would reduce the homing of T cells and IgA<sup>+</sup>&#x000a0;plasma cells to the intestine, thus impair the immune homeostasis of intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Several signal transduction pathways related to inflammatory and immune response were affected by maternal high fat intake. For example, the TGF-&#x003b2; signaling pathway was affected by HF diet, as indicated by the decreasing gene expression of TGF-&#x003b2; and Bmp7 (approximately 1.6 fold reduction). TGF-&#x003b2; is a multifunctional factor regulating cell growth, adhesion and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], also exerting anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting NF-&#x003ba;B expression in the intestinal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The oral administration of TGF-&#x003b2; has been shown to decrease severity and incidence of necrotizing enterocolitis in neonatal rat necrotizing enterocolitis model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, feeding HF diet affected intestinal Jak-STAT signaling pathway, as shown by the decreasing gene expression of IL6, STAT2 and PIK3R5. The Jak-STAT signaling pathway is required for T cell differentiation, B cell maturation and secretion of sIgA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>], these down-regulated genes by HF diet may induce the abnormal intestinal innate immune response. Similarly, previous study demonstrated that maternal high protein diet would decrease liver mass, associated with altering gene expressions mapping to Jak-STAT signaling pathway in mouse offspring [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].</p><p>Furthermore, the lower expressions of TGF-&#x003b2; and PIK3R5 genes by HF diet may affect the progression of colorectal cancer. TGF-&#x003b2;1/Smads signaling pathway was demonstrated to mediate epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition, associated with the progression of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Mutation of PIK3R5 and other genes (i.e. PRKCZ, PTEN, RHEB and RPS6KB1) have altered PI3K signaling pathway, which is the central pathway for both colorectal and breast cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Recent studies also indicated that maternal high fat diet would modify the susceptibility to breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], meanwhile it is dependent on fat or oil sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>].</p><p>In this study, moreover, the markedly reduced glycerol kinase by feeding HF diet suggests the intestinal metabolism was altered. Glycerol kinase is required to release glycerol from glycerol-3-phosphate and dihydroxyacetone, and intestinal glycerol could produce 20&#x02009;~&#x02009;25&#x000a0;% of total endogenous glucose under insulinopenia, suggesting the important role of glycerol in intestinal metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although most of genes were markedly down-regulated by HF diet, some of genes (SOD2, CYP39A1, CCN2, SPARC et al.) were up-regulated. Particularly, SOD2, as an anti-oxidative enzyme in living cells, was highly expressed (1.75 fold change, <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.04). Likewise, a recent study demonstrated that maternal high energy intake increased the expression of SOD in offspring ileum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Previous study indicated that the increasing SOD gene is not necessarily associated with a better antioxidant capability, for example, the inflamed intestinal mucosa has been shown to contain higher SOD protein compared with normal tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. In addition, we found that feeding HF diet markedly increased gene expression of SULT1E by both DNA Microarray and RT-PCR analysis. SULT1E, as an estrogen-preferring drug metabolizing enzyme, its highly expression may be an compensatory response to high circulating estrogen, which occurs in dams fed high fat diet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>]. It has been shown that the estrogen deletion by SULT1E over-expression is associated with the risk of developing different types of cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, maternal high fat intake was able to increase fetal and intestinal weights as well as lactase activity, however, it altered the intestinal immune response, signal transduction and metabolism.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional file</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12944_2016_261_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Effect of maternal high fat intake on gene expression of digestive enzymes in fetal intestine.
