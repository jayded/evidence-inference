While the benefits of paravertebral block (PVB) on pain after thoracotomy and mastectomy have been demonstrated, not enough investigations on the effects of PVB on pain after open cholecystectomy have been conducted. We tested the hypothesis that a single-injection thoracic PVB reduces pain scores, decreases opioid consumption, and prolongs analgesic request time after cholecystectomy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Of 52 patients recruited, 50 completed the study. They were randomly allocated into two groups: the paravertebral group and the control group. The outcome measures were the severity of pain measured on numeric pain rating scale, total opioid consumption, and first analgesic request time during the first postoperative 24 hours.</p></sec><sec><title>Result</title><p>The main outcomes recorded during 24 hours after surgery were Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) pain scores (NRS, 0&#x02013;10), cumulative opioid consumption, and the first analgesic request time. Twenty four hours after surgery, NRS at rest was 4 (3&#x02013;6) vs 5 (5&#x02013;7) and at movement 4 (4&#x02013;7) vs 6 (5&#x02013;7.5) for the PVB and control groups, respectively. The difference between the groups over the whole observation period was statistically significant (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05). Twenty-four hours after surgery, median (25th&#x02013;75th percentile) cumulative morphine consumption was 0 (0&#x02013;2) vs 2.5 (2&#x02013;4) mg (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001) and cumulative tramadol consumption was 200 (150&#x02013;250) mg vs 300 (200&#x02013;350) mg in the paravertebral and in the control group, respectively (<italic>P</italic>=0.003). After surgery, the median (25th&#x02013;75th percentile) first analgesic requirement time was prolonged in the PVB group in statistically significant fashion (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.0001).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion and recommendations</title><p>Single-shot thoracic PVB as a component of multi-modal analgesic regimen provided superior analgesia when compared with the control group up to 24 postoperative hours after cholecystectomy, and we recommend this block for post cholecystectomy pain relief.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>open cholecystectomy</kwd><kwd>postoperative pain</kwd><kwd>paravertebral block</kwd><kwd>landmark technique</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background of the study</title><p>Upper abdominal procedures including cholecystectomy are very painful surgical procedures, and optimal pain management is needed to reduce morbidity, mortality, improve patient outcomes, and reduce hospital costs.<xref rid="b1-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></p><p>Systemic opioids and epidural anesthesia are commonly employed for the treatment of postoperative pain.

Furthermore, open cholecystectomy (no laparoscopic surgery in our case) is one of the most common operations performed in our hospital that may cause severe postoperative pain. Thoracic paravertebral nerve block is routinely performed as part of multimodal analgesia for open cholecystectomy. Unfortunately, its efficacy has never been addressed before. In this study, we assessed the efficacy of unilateral single-shot thoracic paravertebral nerve block using landmark technique for postoperative pain control after open cholecystectomy surgery.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>An institutional-based randomized controlled clinical trial was conducted from February 1 to April 30, 2016. Previously, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and sometimes low-dose weak opioids (tramadol) with or without local wound infiltration were the main management modalities to control postoperative pain. Postoperative pain following cholecystectomy may be controlled with systemic opioids, epidural analgesia, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or posterior intercostal nerve block. Each method has its advantages, but it needs experienced staff and a high degree of surveillance because of the potential risk of hypotension, motor blockade, and respiratory depression. All American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class I and II surgical patients who underwent open cholecystectomy surgery were included in the study. On the other hand, patients with any contraindication for regional anesthesia, such as infection of the puncture site, anatomic deformities, coagulopathy, and allergies to any medication included in the local pain management protocol (data obtained from preoperative anesthetic record), common bile duct exploration, and high body mass index (BMI; &#x0003e;35 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) were excluded from the study.</p><sec><title>Dependent variables</title><p>The outcome variable for the study was the severity of postoperative pain, which was assessed using numerical pain rating scale with/without coughing (movement), total postoperative analgesics consumption, and first analgesic request time.</p></sec><sec><title>Independent variable</title><p>Sociodemographic variables (age, weight, height, BMI), duration of surgery and anesthesia, ASA status, Ramsey sedation score, and postoperative hemodynamic changes were the independent variables.</p></sec><sec><title>Operational definiation</title><p>Numerical pain rating scale is a method of pain assessment where patients are asked to score their pain ratings on a scale of 0&#x02013;10, corresponding to current, best, and worst pain experienced over the 24 hours.

If a letter P was drawn, patients were allocated to the paravertebral group, whereas if a letter C was drawn, the patients were allocated to the control group. Intravenous line was instituted and all patients were given crystaloids. Then, all patients were premedicated with paracetamol 20 mg/kg per os and 1 mg/kg and diclofenac intramuscular. For patients in the paraverteberal group, after aseptic preparation of the skin, the site of injection was infiltrated with 2&#x02013;4 mL of 1% lidocaine, and then using 22 gauge spinal needle TPV block was done by one of the MSC anesthetists. The block was done taking C<sub>7</sub>, the most prominent cervical vertebral as landmark, counting down seven spinous process, palpating for T<sub>7</sub>, and then identifying the needle injection site at 2.5 cm lateral and to the right of the spinous process. Patients were observed closely for symptoms and signs of systemic local anesthetic toxicity and other complications related to the block. According to previous studies, we arbitrarily defined block success as loss of pinprick sensation in 3 or more ipsilateral vertebral dermatomes.<xref rid="b21-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Then, analgesia using the loss of pinprick sensation was checked 15&#x02013;20 minutes after the institution of the block to elicit the extent of somatic blockade. Failed PVB was defined as inability to identify sensory block in the dermatome between T<sub>6</sub> and T<sub>8</sub> 20 minutes after initiation of block, and these patients were excluded from the study. On the operating table, 0.1 mg/kg dexamethasone intravenous as per our protocol for antiemetic prophylaxis and fentanyl 2 mcg/kg were given for all groups. All patients were induced with 2&#x02013;3 mg/kg propofol and relaxed with suxamethonium 2 mg/kg intravenous to facilitate tracheal intubation. Intra-operative anesthesia was maintained with halothane, and relaxation with pancronium. Intraoperative analgesia was maintained with 0.1 mg/kg of morphine. All patients were monitored using an electrocardiogram, noninvasive arterial blood pressure monitor, and pulse oximeter. At the end of the surgical procedure, all patients received 1 mcg/kg of fentanyl. Residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed with intravenous neostigmine 0.05 mg/kg and 20 mcg/kg of atropine, after that the trachea was extubated when the patient was awake and recovered fully from anesthesia. Then, patients were transferred to the recovery room and observed for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes of observation postoperatively, presence and severity of pain and analgesic needs was assessed systematically using structured questionnaire by trained data collectors who were blinded to group allocation.</p><p>These assessments were performed at 30 minutes and 1, 2, 6, and 24 hours postoperatively. Moderate pain was managed using tramadol, and morphine was added for severe pain (NRS &#x02265;7). Ward and recovery nurses were informed and trained about the pain management strategies, and they were involved in the postoperative pain assessment, management, and documentation process. Two BSc qualified anesthetists were selected to collect data, and a one-day training was given on patient randomization, data collection, and postoperative pain management. The intraoperative data collector prepared the drugs, assigned the group, and coded them. He/she also recorded the intraoperative events on the intraoperative data collection tool. At the end of operation, in the recovery room, the coded separated postoperative data collection tool was given to the postoperative data collector who was blinded to the group allocation. In the postoperative period, all patients were given diclofenac 50&#x02013;75 mg TID and 1 g paracetamol QID as soon as they swallowed tablets.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Data management and analysis</title><p>Data were coded, cleaned, entered, and cross-checked using SPSS version 20 statistical package (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA).

Two participants were excluded from the study, one from the PVB group because of failed block diagnosed before induction of general anesthesia by pinprick test that revealed three unblocked adjacent dermatomes, and the other one from the control because of refusal to participate in the postoperative time. Only 50 patients were included in the final analysis. Of these patients, 25 were cases who took 15&#x02013;20 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine and 25 were controls, who were without the block but managed with systemic opioid analgesics.

This, rather, could be related to the preemptive effect of the block, which reduces the nociceptive input to the central nervous system in the first few hours of surgery that could attenuate central sensitization, thereby leading to less postoperative pain.<xref rid="b24-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">24</xref></p><p>Different dematome block levels for cholecystectomy have been reported. In previous studies, after a single injection, a mean sensory level of 2.2 and 1.4 segments above and below the level of injection with the mean value of 4.6 segments<xref rid="b25-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> and sensory analgesia from 1 to 8 dermatomes after a single injection of 0.5% bupivacaine have been reported.<xref rid="b26-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> In our study, patients who had less than 3 dermatomal blocks were excluded. We agreed that this spread is sufficient to block pain sensation after cholecystectomy surgery. Single-injection PVB at T4 is also reported to be as equally effective as multilevel injection for postoperative pain control as shown in a randomized control study conducted on patients undergoing partial mastectomy with lymph node dissection, which possibly minimizes complications associated with multilevel block.<xref rid="b27-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">27</xref></p><p>In this study, the median time for the first analgesic request was significantly prolonged in the single-shot PVB group 120 (60&#x02013;120) vs controls 30 (27.5&#x02013;30, <italic>P</italic>=0.000).

Moreover, this study revealed that the total amount of opioid consumption over the postoperative 24 hours was lower in the PVB group than the control group, with (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), which was comparable with previous studies conducted on various procedures using the same concentration of bupivacaine and levobupivacaine.<xref rid="b28-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b31-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></p><p>However, there are still controversies regarding the efficacy of single-shot PVB for post cholecystectomy pain relief. A single preincisional thoracic paravertebral injection of bupivacaine 0.5%, 20 mL, before cholecystectomy provides complete pain relief for 1&#x02013;6 hours.<xref rid="b32-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> On the other hand, another study revealed that TPVB with 0.5% bupivacaine at a 15-mL bolus dose followed by an infusion of 5 mL/h postoperatively was inadequate after cholecystectomy.<xref rid="b33-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> This implies that single-shot PVB alone may not provide adequate postoperative analgesia and that systemic supplementation may be required.</p><p>Furthermore, there are also discrepancies regarding the mean duration between the initial dose and the first top-up of local anesthetic of 7.2&#x000b1;2.7 hours, which shows a need for supplementation after 7 hours.<xref rid="b34-lra-10-067" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> In the current study, there were no complications associated with PVB.

We recommend further study, including one with a longer time of follow-up of at least 48 hours postoperatively, to evaluate the effect of PVB after cholecystectomy on clinically important outcomes, such as complication rates and intraoperative hemodynamic changes.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We would like to thank the University of Gondar for financial support.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-lra-10-067"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Baidya</surname><given-names>DK</given-names></name><name><surname>Khanna</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Maitra</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Analgesic efficacy and safety of thoracic paravertebral and epidural analgesia for thoracic surgery: a systematic review and meta-analysis</article-title><source>Interact Cardiovasc Thorac Surg</source><year>2014</year><volume>18</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>626</fpage><lpage>635</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">24488821</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-lra-10-067"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Gan</surname><given-names>TJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>SB</given-names></name><name><surname>Oderda</surname><given-names>GM</given-names></name><name><surname>Scranton</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Pepin</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ramamoorthy</surname><given-names>S</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Impact of postsurgical opioid use and ileus on economic outcomes in gastrointestinal surgeries</article-title><source>Curr Med Res Opin</source><year>2015</year><volume>31</volume><issue>4</issue><fpage>677</fpage><lpage>686</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25586296</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-lra-10-067"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Glissmeyer</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Sherman</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><name><surname>Glissmeyer</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name><name><surname>Garreau</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>N</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Effect of paravertebral nerve blocks on narcotic use after mastectomy with reconstruction</article-title><source>Am J Surg</source><year>2015</year><volume>209</volume><issue>5</issue><fpage>881</fpage><lpage>883</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">25886701</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-lra-10-067"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>L&#x000f6;nnqvist</surname><given-names>P</given-names></name><name><surname>Olsson</surname><given-names>G</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Paravertebral vs epidural block in children.
