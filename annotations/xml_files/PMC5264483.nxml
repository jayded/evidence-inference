Since the discovery of a link between gut microbiota and obesity in 2006 (<xref rid="bb0230" ref-type="bibr">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>, <xref rid="bb0105" ref-type="bibr">Ley et al., 2006</xref>), increasing evidence has been presented to suggest a causal relationship between gut microbiota and metabolic disorders (<xref rid="bb0205" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>One of the mechanisms postulated to explain this relationship is the metabolic endotoxemia hypothesis, which links gut microbes to low-grade inflammation and further to metabolic disorders (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Burcelin et al., 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0025" ref-type="bibr">Cani et al., 2007</xref>). In experimental animals (<xref rid="bb0195" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0015" ref-type="bibr">Brun et al., 2007</xref>) and also in humans (<xref rid="bb0215" ref-type="bibr">Teixeira et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0100" ref-type="bibr">Leber et al., 2012</xref>), obesity and metabolic disorders have been associated with an impaired gut barrier, which may lead to increased translocation of endotoxins (<xref rid="bb0080" ref-type="bibr">Kallio et al., 2015</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2014</xref>), especially in connection with a Western diet (<xref rid="bb0155" ref-type="bibr">Pendyala et al., 2012</xref>). These highly inflammatory components can ultimately lead to tissue inflammation and, consequently, metabolic disorders (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Burcelin et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Dietary recommendations have been put forward to try to prevent metabolic disorders. In the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study, carried out in a large cohort of middle-aged participants with impaired glucose tolerance, a simple lifestyle intervention reduced the risk of diabetes by 58% compared to control (<xref rid="bb0225" ref-type="bibr">Tuomilehto et al., 2001</xref>). Of those subjects with excellent adherence to the intervention program, meeting four of the five intervention goals, none developed type 2 diabetes. Still, in the general population, the prevalence of metabolic disorders is rapidly increasing, and supportive prevention options&#x02014;such as those targeting the gut microbiota&#x02014;need to be developed to support current standards of care.</p><p>Probiotics are live micro-organisms that confer health benefits to the host (<xref rid="bb0055" ref-type="bibr">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), whereas prebiotics are fibers that selectively improve the growth of beneficial gut microbes (<xref rid="bb0045" ref-type="bibr">Gibson and Roberfroid, 1995</xref>). In experimental animals, we have previously shown that <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> ssp. <italic>lactis</italic> 420 (B420) prevented weight gain, improved insulin sensitivity, as well as reduced endotoxemia and tissue inflammation (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Amar et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2015b</xref>, <xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Garidou et al., 2015</xref>). The probiotic B420 has been given to humans in earlier clinical trials, albeit at quite low doses (<xref rid="bb0085" ref-type="bibr">Klein et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0175" ref-type="bibr">Roessler et al., 2008</xref>, <xref rid="bb0090" ref-type="bibr">Kok et al., 1996</xref>), but its potential <italic>anti</italic>-obesity effects have remained unexplored. The prebiotic employed in the current study, Litesse&#x000ae; Ultra polydextrose (LU), is a randomly cross-linked polymer of glucose, which remains undigested by the host and may increase the number of <italic>Bifidobacteria</italic> in a colonic continuous culture system (<xref rid="bb0165" ref-type="bibr">Probert et al., 2004</xref>). Its administration has been reported to induce satiation (<xref rid="bb0060" ref-type="bibr">Ibarra et al., 2015</xref>) and to ameliorate the glycemic response to a glucose load (<xref rid="bb0065" ref-type="bibr">Jie et al., 2000</xref>), indicating potential benefits for weight maintenance and metabolic health.</p><p>To date, there is no conclusive evidence for the ability of probiotics to control body fat mass in humans. Despite a fair amount of promising clinical findings (<xref rid="bb0185" ref-type="bibr">Sanchez et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kadooka et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kadooka et al., 2013</xref>, <xref rid="bb0140" ref-type="bibr">Osterberg et al., 2015</xref>), randomized controlled trials demonstrating beneficial probiotic effects in the primary statistical analysis of a well-powered study conducted according to Good Clinical Practice (GCP) are lacking. Only few studies on prebiotics have shown effects on weight management (<xref rid="bb0150" ref-type="bibr">Parnell and Reimer, 2009</xref>, <xref rid="bb0110" ref-type="bibr">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, no clinical trials have explored probiotics and prebiotics alone and in combination to assess their potential synergistic benefits for metabolic health. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multi-center clinical trial adhering to the GCP principles to investigate the effects of a probiotic (B420) and a prebiotic (LU) on weight management and an extensive panel of mechanistic parameters, including markers of low-grade inflammation, adipose tissue metabolism, bacterial translocation and fecal short-chain fatty acids.</p></sec><sec id="s0010"><label>2</label><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This double-blind, randomized, parallel, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted in four clinical research centers in southern Finland: VL-Medi Oy (Helsinki), Clinical Research Services Turku (Turku), FinnMedi Oy (Tampere) and Kerava Health Care Center (Kerava).

Microcrystalline cellulose was chosen as placebo because it contains virtually no energy and is less fermented by gut microbes than alternative dietary fibers. Participants were provided with commercially available fruit smoothie products and instructed to mix the contents of one sachet into a 250&#x000a0;ml bottle of smoothie (130&#x000a0;kcal) each day while otherwise maintaining their regular diet. The smoothies were provided to the subjects to mask subtle differences in the study products and to standardize the matrix in which the products were consumed.</p><p>Following separate visits for screening and baseline assessments, participants used the study product for six months, during which they came for clinic visits at 2&#x000a0;months, 4&#x000a0;months and 6&#x000a0;months, with in-between telephone contacts to track compliance and potential adverse events. After completing the intervention, participants came for one more follow-up clinic visit one month after the end of the dietary intervention (month 7).</p><p>Compliance was monitored with three different methods: 1) Participants were asked to report product intake on a specific check-list, 2) Participants were asked to return all used and unused sachets to the site to count the number of opened sachets per the number of treatment days, and 3) Fecal samples were analyzed for the presence of B420 with qPCR from all participant who returned a fecal sample at the six-month visit. Details of the qPCR detection procedures are reported in the Supplemental Materials and Methods. In the Intention-to-Treat (ITT) population, the average calculated compliance (method 2) was 86% across groups, while in the B420 and LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 groups the bacterial strain was detected in the feces of 82% of participants. The primers used for qPCR were also able to detect certain other <italic>Bifidobacterium animalis</italic> ssp. <italic>lactis</italic> strains such as HN019, Bl-04 and Bi-07, but not Bb12. Four participants (8%) in the Placebo group and seven (15%) in the LU group tested positive in the qPCR assay (Table S1).</p><p>Product stability was monitored throughout the study.

The effect seemed to persist throughout the one-month wash-out period (<xref rid="f0010" ref-type="fig">Fig. 2</xref>C).

In other regions of the body LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 had no effect. LU and B420 (alone) were not statistically different from Placebo in any of the above mentioned variables. For absolute values in all measured areas of the body in the PP population, please refer to Table S4.

Furthermore, our study demonstrates synergy between a probiotic and a prebiotic fiber supplement in promoting lean body mass accumulation. We also present results on biomarkers associated with gut barrier function, reduced inflammatory tone and intestinal microbiota metabolism that suggest a potential mechanism of action for B420 and LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 in reducing body fat mass.</p><p>We have previously shown that B420 reduces body fat mass gain in mice that are fed a high-fat diet (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2014</xref>). In the current study, only the LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 group significantly reduced total body fat mass compared to Placebo in the PP population, while there were no differences in the ITT population. A post-hoc factorial analysis showed that B420 alone had a significant effect in both the ITT and PP population. The differences between the treatment groups were consistent across several outcomes, providing further support to the previous results obtained in experimental animals.</p><p>We conducted statistical analyses on both, ITT and PP populations, with different conclusions. In the ITT populations we used for missing observations the Last Observation Carried Forward method that is a widely accepted approach, but can alter the conclusions of very long studies, which are prone to drop-outs and protocol violations. The findings of the PP population can be considered as being better representative of the effect of the investigated products, but they, in turn, are prone to bias from participant drop-outs. In this study, our PP population included 64% of the ITT population, mainly due to drop-outs, non-compliance and use of systemic antimicrobials. This weakens the statistical power in the PP population and warrants further studies to support the present findings.</p><p>In the current study, the study participants in the Placebo group gained approximately 1&#x000a0;kg (1.1%) of weight compared to baseline. This weight gain was not due to increased energy intake from the smoothie vehicle, as energy intake did not change in the Placebo group (&#x02212;&#x000a0;23&#x000a0;kcal). On the contrary, the LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 and B420 groups showed considerable reductions in their energy intake (&#x02212;&#x000a0;230 and &#x02212;&#x000a0;320&#x000a0;kcal/day, respectively), while body weight and body fat mass did not differ from baseline, suggesting that B420 and LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 normalized energy balance by reducing energy intake to a level that maintains, rather than increases, body fat mass.</p><p>According to the Helsinki Health Study, steady weight gain over time is rather common among an average Finnish middle-aged population (<xref rid="bb0120" ref-type="bibr">Loman et al., 2013</xref>), as approximately 30% gained at least 5&#x000a0;kg weight during a 5&#x02013;7-year follow-up period.

The effect size seen in the current study (6.7% difference in trunk fat between LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 and Placebo) is quite comparable to that seen in 12-week interventions with <italic>Lactobacillus gasseri</italic> SBT2055 where abdominal fat was reduced by approximately 4.5% compared to placebo (<xref rid="bb0070" ref-type="bibr">Kadooka et al., 2010</xref>, <xref rid="bb0075" ref-type="bibr">Kadooka et al., 2013</xref>). It is difficult to compare the employed statistical methodology, however, because it remains unclear which participants were included in the analyses.

In the present study, we did not find marked differences between the observed effects in men and women.</p><p>In terms of effect size, it is difficult to compare probiotics to pharmaceuticals, because the latter have been tested for weight loss instead of fat mass loss, and they are accompanied by a weight-loss program. However, the reported changes in body weight at six months compared to placebo have been: &#x02212;&#x000a0;3.5&#x000a0;kg for orlistat (<xref rid="bb0220" ref-type="bibr">Torgerson et al., 2004</xref>), &#x02212;&#x000a0;5.5% for liraglutide (<xref rid="bb0160" ref-type="bibr">Pi-Sunyer et al., 2015</xref>), and &#x02212;&#x000a0;3.2% for locaserin (<xref rid="bb0135" ref-type="bibr">O'neil et al., 2012</xref>), compared to &#x02212;&#x000a0;1.4&#x000a0;kg (&#x02212;&#x000a0;4.5%) with LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 and &#x02212;&#x000a0;1.0&#x000a0;kg (&#x02212;&#x000a0;3.0%) with B420 in fat mass in the present study. It should be noted that probiotics are taken orally once per day, while orlistat is taken multiple times per day and liraglutide requires a daily subcutaneous injection. Therefore, probiotics and synbiotics could be a safe and convenient, non-pharmaceutical support for controlling body fat mass, especially prophylactically.</p><p>The results of this study showed that changes in circulating zonulin levels correlated with changes in trunk fat mass, but only in the LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 group, indicating a potential mechanistic relationship between zonulin and trunk fat mass. Also, B420 tended to reduce levels of circulating zonulin. Zonulin is the human analogue of the zonula occludens toxin produced by <italic>Vibrio cholera</italic> (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2000</xref>, <xref rid="bb0035" ref-type="bibr">Fasano et al., 2000</xref>). It selectively increases intestinal permeability in jejunum and ileum (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2000</xref>), and its release is induced by certain gut microbes, especially pathogens (<xref rid="bb0030" ref-type="bibr">El Asmar et al., 2002</xref>), indicating that zonulin could act as a mechanistic link between changes in the gut microbiota and gut barrier function.</p><p>When measured from circulation, zonulin has been linked with insulin resistance (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Moreno-Navarrete et al., 2012</xref>), type 2 diabetes (<xref rid="bb0240" ref-type="bibr">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), higher BMI (<xref rid="bb0130" ref-type="bibr">Moreno-Navarrete et al., 2012</xref>) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (<xref rid="bb0145" ref-type="bibr">Pacifico et al., 2014</xref>). The link between circulating zonulin and intestinal zonulin remains somewhat elusive, since circulating zonulin might not originate only from the gut (<xref rid="bb0235" ref-type="bibr">Wang et al., 2000</xref>). Nevertheless, decreased circulating zonulin is associated with a decreased lactulose/mannitol ratio, an indicator of intestinal permeability (<xref rid="bb0180" ref-type="bibr">Russo et al., 2012</xref>, <xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>), as well as fewer postoperative infection complications (<xref rid="bb0115" ref-type="bibr">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, type 1 diabetic patients and their relatives were found to have increased circulating zonulin levels that correlated with intestinal permeability (<xref rid="bb0190" ref-type="bibr">Sapone et al., 2006</xref>). According to these findings, it is plausible that the changes in circulating zonulin, as seen in the present study, are related to an improvement in gut barrier function.</p><p>Improved gut barrier function is hypothesized to reduce metabolic endotoxemia, especially the concentration of highly inflammatory LPS, and reduce low-grade inflammation (<xref rid="bb0020" ref-type="bibr">Burcelin et al., 2009</xref>). Our earlier studies have shown that B420 improves epithelial barrier function in cell culture (<xref rid="bb0170" ref-type="bibr">Putaala et al., 2008</xref>) and reduces epithelial translocation of <italic>E. coli</italic> as well as circulating LPS levels in mice (<xref rid="bb0005" ref-type="bibr">Amar et al., 2011</xref>, <xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2014</xref>). We have also recently shown that LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 modulates the intestinal immune system in mice and changes the microbial DNA signature in adipose tissue, which were associated with improvements in glucose metabolism (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Garidou et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this present study we saw a subtle increase in plasma LPS levels without activation of inflammatory responses. LPS levels were below or close to the detection limit both at baseline and at the end of intervention, questioning the clinical relevance of this LPS increase. However, this finding could point to a different manifestation of metabolic endotoxemia between mice and humans. The LAL methodology detects total LPS level in a sample and does not specify which bacterial species the LPS molecules originate from. It has been reported that the LPS levels detected with the LAL method may considerably differ from their cytokine-producing potency (<xref rid="bb0050" ref-type="bibr">Gutsmann et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, although the level of total LPS was increased with LU&#x000a0;+&#x000a0;B420 treatment, its quality and inflammatory potency may have also been changed by the treatment. This hypothesis was supported by the tendency towards reduced hsCRP levels.</p><p>We did not see treatment-associated reductions in blood glucose, HbA1c, insulin or HOMA-IR in the present study. Although we recruited overweight and obese participants, baseline laboratory values indicated that the participants had normal fasting glucose (average 5.18&#x02013;5.24&#x000a0;mmol/l) and insulin (average 7.84&#x02013;9.07&#x000a0;mU/l) levels, leaving very little room for improvement. Previously, we have shown improvement in glucose metabolism with both B420 alone (<xref rid="bb0200" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2014</xref>, <xref rid="bb0210" ref-type="bibr">Stenman et al., 2015b</xref>) and in combination with LU (<xref rid="bb0040" ref-type="bibr">Garidou et al., 2015</xref>). The treatments should be tested in populations with impaired glucose metabolism or in patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical intervention trial in overweight and obese adults presents preliminary clinical evidence that the probiotic B420 with or without Litesse Ultra polydextrose can reduce body fat mass, waist circumference, energy intake and body weight compared to placebo. Our findings are of special interest to populations who struggle to control their weight in a Western cultural environment. Additionally, B420 and LU seem to have synergistic effects in increasing lean body mass. LU alone had no effect on the parameters tested. Mechanistically, the reduction of body fat mass might be related to circulating zonulin, a potential marker of gut barrier function, and attenuated low-grade inflammation, which both support previous findings from experimental animals. Further clinical trials are warranted to confirm these effects in larger participant populations and to further elucidate the underlying mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s0115"><title>Funding Sources</title><p>This study was fully funded by DuPont Nutrition &#x00026; Health.
