It is an effective and safe medicine for the prophylaxis and treatment of chronic asthma. It is also used to prevent acute exercise-induced bronchoconstriction and as a symptomatic relief of seasonal allergic rhinitis and perennial allergic rhinitis.</p></sec><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The aim of this study was to evaluate the bioequivalence (BE) of two drug products: generic MT 5 mg chewable tablets versus the branded drug Singulair<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> pediatric 5 mg chewable tablets among Mediterranean volunteers.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>An open-label, randomized two-period crossover BE design was conducted in 32 healthy male volunteers with a 9-day washout period between doses and under fasting conditions. The drug concentrations in plasma were quantified by using a newly developed and fully validated liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method, and the pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using a non-compartmental model. The ratio for generic/branded tablets using geometric least squares means was calculated for both the MT products.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The relationship between concentration and peak area ratio was found to be linear within the range 6.098&#x02013;365.855 ng/mL. The correlation coefficient (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup>) was always greater than 0.99 during the course of the validation. Statistical comparison of the main pharmacokinetic parameters showed no significant difference between the generic and branded products. The point estimates (ratios of geometric means) were 101.2%, 101.6%, and 98.11% for area under the curve (AUC)<sub>0&#x02192;last</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02192;inf</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>, respectively.

It is usually administered once daily in a dose of 10 mg or 5 mg per tablet. Other dosage forms have been approved by the FDA; these include oral granules at a dose of 4 mg and chewable tablets at doses of 4 mg or 5 mg.<xref rid="b14-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In fact, the FDA has invited pharmaceutical manufacturers to develop and produce proper dosage forms, especially for pediatric patients. In this context, chewable tablets are known to be advantageous over liquid dosage forms in many aspects, such as higher palatability, better bioavailability, stability, dose precision, portability, and ease of administration, especially during traveling.<xref rid="b16-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b18-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> However, many challenges may be encountered during the development of chewable tablets, such as the taste and the bioequivalence (BE) of the drug when compared with the original brand. In fact, unsuitable taste may result in poor patient compliance. Chewing the tablet may result in immediate disintegration and partial dissolution or degradation of the drug in the saliva, and this may affect the amount of drug available for absorption. In the current study, the generic MT chewable tablet was formulated to be tasty, bioavailable, and as safe as the original brand. Accordingly, the objective of this study was to investigate the BE of this formulation by comparing its pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters with the original brand by developing a liquid chromatography&#x02013;mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method for the determination of MT. In addition, the safety of the two formulations, on the basis of clinical and laboratory observation and documentation of adverse events, was also investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-dddt-9-5315">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study was a comparative, randomized, two-period, two-treatment, two-sequence, single-dose, open-label, crossover BE study of generic MT 5 mg chewable tablets versus the brand drug Singulair<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> pediatric 5 mg chewable tablets given to healthy subjects under fasting conditions.</p><sec><title>Volunteers and clinical protocol</title><p>The study was conducted by Arab Pharmaceutical Industry Consulting Co.

The volunteers were aged between 18 years and 50 years, weighing between 57 kg and 93 kg with an average weight of 76 kg. The volunteers were subjected to a full medical and physical examination to confirm their health status and were not on any medication during the study period. A written informed consent form, which explained the nature of the study, was given to the volunteers. The volunteers were instructed to abstain from taking drugs for 1 month before the study initiation, to abstain from caffeine and alcohol-containing beverages for at least 16 hours prior to each study drug administration and throughout the study period, and to fast for at least 10 hours before drug administration.</p><p>The study used an open-label, randomized two-period crossover design with a 9-day washout period between doses in 32 healthy subjects under fasting conditions. The volunteers were randomly divided into two groups, each of 16 subjects. The first group was given the reference brand and the second group was given the test formulation with a crossover after the washout period. On the morning of the study, each volunteer gave a blood sample to serve as a blank for the drug assay. Each volunteer received an oral dose of the assigned formulation given with 240 mL of water in the sitting position. During each period, blood samples were taken from each volunteer for the calculation of the PK parameters at pre and up to 24 hours after drug dosing. Each sample volume was 8 mL, 1 hour before dosing, and 8 mL of samples were withdrawn at the following time points: 0.50 hour, 1.00 hour, 1.50 hours, 1.75 hours, 2.00 hours, 2.25 hours, 2.50 hours, 2.75 hours, 3.00 hours, 3.25 hours, 3.50 hours, 3.75 hours, 4.00 hours, 5.00 hours, 6.00 hours, 8.00 hours, 12.00 hours, 16.00 hours, and 24.00 hours after dosing. Blood samples were collected in tubes containing heparin and centrifuged to separate the plasma fraction of the blood. The resulting plasma was immediately stored at &#x02212;70&#x000b0;C and analyzed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Four hours after drug administration, a standard lunch meal containing soup (no carrots), a half chicken, rice with mixed vegetables (no carrots), yogurt, a loaf of bread, and salad (tomato and cucumber) was served, and subjects had free access to water 1 hour after drug administration.</p></sec><sec><title>Chemicals and reagents</title><p>MT working standard was supplied by Morepen Laboratories Ltd.

The mass spectrometer was operated with a source temperature of 550&#x000b0;C. Electrospray in positive ionization mode with a needle voltage of 4 kV was used. Multiple reaction monitoring mode was used for the detection of the drug and its ISTd with monitoring of following transitions: 586.384/568.300 and 586.384/422.200 for MT and 592.288/574.300 and 592.288/427.300 for MT-d6.</p><p>An ACE 5 CN column was used with 5 cm length and 4.6 mm internal diameter (Hichrom Limited, Reading, UK).

All the calibration and the QC samples were spiked with IS in which 0.1 mL of plasma was spiked by 30 &#x000b5;L of the stock internal solution to get final concentration of IS of 119.5 ng/mL; each sample was shaken for 30 seconds using a vortex shaker. Then 1 mL of acetonitrile was added to remove protein followed by vortex mixing and centrifuging at 14,000 rpm for 5 minutes. The supernatant was removed for analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Validation procedures</title><p>The method was validated for its application to the analysis of MT in the biological fluids by spiking standards into blank plasma. Sampling lasted 24 hours after drug administration in order to finalize the BE study. The method was validated in accordance with the international guidelines, and all the validation parameters, including linearity, accuracy, precision, and limit of quantitation, were calculated for the developed method.</p><p>The linearity assessment was performed using a series of nine standard plasma solutions previously spiked with MT (calibrator), which were employed for constructing calibration curves covering a concentration ranging from 6.098 ng/mL to 365.855 ng/mL. The accuracy and precision were determined by using a minimum of six replicates per concentration level. The limit of quantitation was determined by injecting a series of diluted solutions with known concentrations.</p><p>In addition, stock solution stability in mobile phase was assessed using two standard mixtures that were equivalent to the lower limit of quantification and upper limit of quantification along with the IS.</p><p>Short- and long-term matrix-based stabilities were assessed using two QCL and QCH MT concentrations. Stability after freeze and thaw cycles was assessed using two sets of QC samples that were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles (stability samples). The stability of the samples was compared to a freshly prepared calibration curve and was analyzed in a single run in comparison with the QC sample (comparison sample).</p><p>Whole blood stability was assessed by spiking whole blood samples with two different concentrations. The matrix effect was investigated for MT and the IS. The matrix factor (MF) should be calculated in each lot of matrix, by calculating the ratio of the peak area in the presence of matrix to the peak area in the absence of matrix (pure solution of the MT). The IS-normalized MF was also calculated by dividing the MF of the analyte by the MF of the IS. The QC samples were used to evaluate the performance of the assay. They were prepared by spiking blank plasma with MT. The QC samples were prepared to have low, medium, and high concentrations (MT: 18.293 ng/mL, 304.879 ng/mL, and 457.319 ng/mL). Four QC samples were incorporated with each analysis run as unknown samples. The concentration in each QC sample was determined from the calibration curve and was compared with the nominal concentration. The analysis run was accepted if at least three out of four QC samples were within 15% of the nominal concentration. No carryover or matrix effect was found.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis</title><p>The PK parameters were estimated using standard non- compartmental methods. The peak plasma concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub>) and the corresponding time of peak plasma concentration (<italic>T</italic><sub>max</sub>) were taken directly from the data. The elimination rate constant (ke) was estimated from the slope of the semi-logarithmic plot of the terminal elimination phase of the plasma concentration&#x02013;time curve. The equation <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub>= ln2/ke was used to calculate the elimination half-life time (<italic>T</italic><sub>1/2</sub>).

The values obtained were compliant with the FDA and EMEA requirements for BE of generic drugs since the AUC<sub>0&#x02192;inf</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02192;last</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> mean ratios are within the 80%&#x02013;125% interval.<xref rid="b31-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="b32-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">32</xref></p><p>The limitations of the study as per all BE studies were the relatively small sample size and administration of a single dose in healthy male volunteers. Also the inclusion of adults instead of pediatric volunteers could be reported as another limitation, but this was according to FDA guidelines and in order to safeguard the pediatric population from unnecessary risk. Several clinical studies have highlighted the efficacy of Singulair<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> pediatric in the treatment of asthma in both adults and children<xref rid="b3-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b7-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> and for the symptomatic relief of allergic rhinitis.<xref rid="b9-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b11-dddt-9-5315" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Given the BE demonstrated for Broncast 5 mg chewable tablets, this product is expected to be equally effi-cacious and well tolerated.</p><p>Safety is also important. In our study, the administered drugs were tolerated and all the participated volunteers completed the study without showing any signs of adverse effects and were released in good health. Accordingly, this product offers an efficacious treatment option for individuals with asthma or seasonal/perennial allergic rhinitis with relatively lower cost in comparison with the established brand.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The statistical analysis of the results was performed on AUC<sub>0&#x02192;last</sub>, AUC<sub>0&#x02192;inf</sub>, and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> using the analysis of variance method and showed that both test chewable and reference tablets (Singulair<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> pediatric 5 mg chewable tablet) were bioequivalent, since they deliver equivalent quantities of active ingredient to the systemic circulation at equivalent rates for both AUC<sub>0&#x02192;</sub>last and <italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> ratios within the 80%&#x02013;125% interval proposed by the FDA and EMA. These results showed that the formulation of this new generic tablet was good, which is important for achieving good therapeutic benefits and avoiding any potential problems that may arise from poor formulation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors wish to express their sincere gratitude to one and all who directly or indirectly have contributed in any form to
