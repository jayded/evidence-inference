Due to toxicity, this standard schedule (50&#x000a0;mg daily 4/2) can induce up to 50% of sunitinib dose modification (reduction and/or interruption). The current recommendation in such case is to reduce the dose to 37.5&#x000a0;mg per day (standard schedule 4/2). Recent data highlight an alternative schedule: 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment followed by 1&#x000a0;week of pause (experimental schedule 2/1). The SURF trial is set up to evaluate prospectively experimental schedule 2/1 when toxicity occurs. This article displays the key elements of the study protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">SURF [NCT02689167] is a prospective, randomized, open-label phase IIb study. Patients are included at sunitinib initiation while receiving standard schedule 4/2 (50&#x000a0;mg daily) according to the marketing authorization indication. When a dose adjustment of sunitinib is required, patients are randomized between standard schedule 4/2 (37.5&#x000a0;mg daily) and experimental schedule 2/1 (50&#x000a0;mg daily). Key eligibility criteria are the following: patients with locally advanced inoperable or MRCC who are starting first-line treatment with sunitinib, with histologically or cytologically confirmed renal cancer clear cell variant or with a clear cell component, and with Karnofsky performance status &#x02265;70%. The primary objective is to assess the median duration of sunitinib treatment (DOT) in each group. The key secondary objectives are progression-free survival, overall survival, time to randomization, objective response rate, safety, sunitinib dose intensity, health-related quality of life, and the description of main drivers triggering randomization. We hypothesized that experimental schedule 2/1 would result in an improvement in median DOT from 6 to 8.5&#x000a0;months. It was estimated that 112 patients would be needed in each arm during 24&#x000a0;months. In order to take into account the possibility of treatment discontinuation before randomization, 248 patients are necessary.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par3">The SURF trial is asking a pragmatic question adapted to the current practice on what is the best way to adapt sunitinib when treatment-related adverse events occur.

More than 120,000 cases of RCC are being diagnosed each year in Europe and in the USA, and the incidence of RCC seems to be rising.</p><p id="Par20">Sunitinib is an anti-angiogenic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) indicated for the treatment of advanced or MRCC in adults. It is mainly used in the first-line setting at the initial dose of 50&#x000a0;mg taken orally once daily for 4 consecutive weeks followed by a 2-week rest period to comprise a complete cycle of 6&#x000a0;weeks (schedule 4/2). Recommendations in case of required dose modification indicate a dose reduction to 37.5&#x000a0;mg per day and if necessary further to reduce the dose to 25&#x000a0;mg daily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Another promising adjustment schedule is to continue with the daily dose of 50&#x000a0;mg while making more frequent break periods: 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment followed by a pause of 1&#x000a0;week (schedule 2/1). This last regimen is expected to reduce adverse events and preserve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) while maintaining the same dose intensity. Maintaining exposure to sunitinib seems essential based on previously reported data linking exposure to drug activity in the MRCC setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The experience of the Cleveland Clinic with 30 patients treated with schedule 2/1 showed a significant improvement in the tolerance for the drug, without grade 4 toxicity and with less than 30% of patients with grade 3 toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par21">In a multicentre one-arm prospective study, 60 patients were treated with 50&#x000a0;mg on schedule 2/1, but it did not result in a lower rate of grade III or higher fatigue and diarrhea when compared to historical data from trials employing schedule 4/2. However, efficacy data showed a robust response rate and a prolonged progression-free survival, suggestive of improved long-term tolerability in patients receiving sunitinib on schedule 2/1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. In another prospective phase II study of an individualized sunitinib schedule, 22 patients got sunitinib 50&#x000a0;mg schedule 2/1 as the optimal schedule with good efficacy on the overall response rate (ORR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Sunitinib administered with schedule 2/1 was associated with less toxicity and higher failure-free survival (FFS) at 6&#x000a0;months than that administered with schedule 4/2, without compromising the efficacy in terms of ORR and time to progression (TTP) in a multicentre, randomized, open-label phase II trial, where 38 patients were treated with schedule 2/1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Many retrospective studies showed better tolerance and efficacy of schedule 2/1 such as the RAINBOW cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. The main drawback of these data comes from their retrospective status and the small size of the populations for the prospective trials.</p><p id="Par22">The SURF trial aims at evaluating prospectively at a larger scale the efficacy and safety of sunitinib according to the adaptation of the administration regimen (schedule 4/2 or 2/1) in patients with advanced or MRCC.

The final analysis of the DOT will take place after 112 events. The total duration of the study (between the first inclusion and the final analysis) is estimated to be 60&#x000a0;months.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par112">At the time this manuscript was written, 80 patients have been included in the SURF trial, which makes it the largest prospective cohort of patients assessing the question of alternative schedule 2/1 of sunitinib. In comparison to the current available data, this trial will be able to provide more robust data about an alternative schedule of sunitinib based on an academic study.</p><p id="Par113">The SURF trial is asking a pragmatic question adapted to the current practice: what is the best way to adapt sunitinib when side effects occur? In the SURF trial, randomization does not occur at the start of sunitinib but when a dose modification is required. The decision to randomize the patient is based on the choice of the physician. The purpose of the SURF trial is to bring robust prospective data of efficacy and side effects that can sustain the use of alternative schedule 2/1 in clinical routine practice. Furthermore, HRQoL data evaluated by the EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire will bring patient perspective on the alternative schedule.</p><p id="Par114">One of the limitations of this design is a potential loss of power depending on the number of patients who may leave the study before randomization. We estimated that 10% of the patients could be lost between the initiation of the treatment and a potential randomization.</p><p id="Par115">Recently, the FDA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] approved sunitinib in an adjuvant setting for high-risk patients following the results of the S-TRAC trial, showing that sunitinib improved PFS in high-risk patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. In this trial, patients started sunitinib at 50&#x000a0;mg with schedule 4/2. When toxicity occurred, dose interruptions or dose reductions to 37.5&#x000a0;mg per day were allowed, depending on the type and severity of the toxicity. An alternative schedule was not allowed. In the sunitinib arm, 48.8% of patients had grade III adverse events and 12.1% grade IV adverse events. Furthermore concerning HRQoL, on most QLQ-C30 subscales, patients in the sunitinib group had lower scores than those in the placebo group. Dose reductions and interruptions because of adverse events occurred in 34.3% and 46.4%, respectively, of the patients in the sunitinib group, and treatment discontinuations owing to adverse events occurred in 86 patients (28.1%) in the sunitinib group. In this setting, improving the management of side effects and maintaining HRQoL will be a high-priority topic.</p><p id="Par116">Therefore, the results of the SURF trial will bring useful data on how to deal with sunitinib administration in case of toxicity, for clinicians dealing with patients having renal cell carcinoma at various stages of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par117">Date of enrollment of the first participant to the trial: 19 March 2016.</p><p id="Par118">Last protocol version number and date: version 11, 24 November 2017.</p><p id="Par119">Approximate date when recruitment will be completed: March 2018.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec31"><p>
