Artesunate&#x0002b;chlorproguanil-dapsone (AS&#x0002b;CD) was a potential alternative for treatment of uncomplicated malaria. A comparison of the efficacy and safety of these three drug combinations was necessary to make evidence based drug treatment policies.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Five hundred and thirty-four, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) normal children were randomised in blocks of 15 to the AS&#x0002b;AQ, AL or AS&#x0002b;CD groups. Administration of study drugs was supervised by project staff and the children were followed up at r home on days 1,2,3,7,14 and 28 post treatment. Parasitological and clinical failures and adverse events were compared between the study groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Main Findings</title><p>In a per-protocol analysis, the parasitological and clinical failure rate at day 28 post treatment (PCF28) was lower in the AS&#x0002b;AQ group compared to the AL or AS&#x0002b;CD groups (corrected for re-infections: 6.6&#x00025; vs 13.8&#x00025; and 13.8&#x00025; respectively, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.08; uncorrected: 14.6&#x00025; vs 27.6&#x00025; and 28.1&#x00025; respectively, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.005). In the intention to treat analysis, the rate of early treatment failure was high in all three groups (AS&#x0002b;AQ 13.3&#x00025;; AL 15.2&#x00025;; and AS&#x0002b;CD 9.3&#x00025;, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.2) primarily due to vomiting. However, the PCF28 corrected for re-infection was lower, though not significantly, in the AS&#x0002b;AQ group compared to the AL or the AS&#x0002b;CD groups (AS&#x0002b;AQ 18.3&#x00025;; AL 24.2&#x00025;; AS&#x0002b;CD 20.8&#x00025;, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.4) The incidence of adverse events was comparable between the groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>AS&#x0002b;AQ is an appropriate first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Ghana and possibly in the neighbouring countries in West Africa. The effectiveness of AL in routine programme conditions needs to be studied further in West Africa.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00119145">NCT00119145</ext-link>

There has been no comparative studies of the efficacy and safety of AS&#x0002b;CD versus AS&#x0002b;AQ or AL. Even though most countries in Africa have adopted ACT as first line treatment, antimalarial monotherapy is still common and this can undermine the efficacy of ACT.

Malaria transmission in this forest region of Ghana is perennial but peaks in July&#x02013;August and the entomological inoculation rate is high, about 270 infective bites per person per year. Although the study area has high transmission, malaria is common in older children and therefore the study included children up to 10 years of age. From June 2005 to May 2006, 1718 children aged 6 months to 10 years who attended the study hospital's outpatient department with a history of fever or an axillary temperature &#x02265;37.5&#x000b0;C were examined for malaria parasitaemia and screened for their eligibility for enrolment in this study after written, informed consent had been obtained from their caretakers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0002530-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Children were screened for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency before randomisation (the G6PD test took about 1hour). A total of 630 children were eligible; 534 were G6PD normal and 96 were G6PD deficient. The G6PD normal children were randomly assigned to the AL, AS&#x0002b;AQ, or AS&#x0002b;CD groups. The G6PD deficient children were randomised to the AS&#x0002b;AQ or AL group only because the Ghana Ministry of Health Ethical Committee expressed concern about the possibility of haemolysis associated with chlorproguanil-dapsone treatment in G6PD deficient children.</p><fig id="pone-0002530-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0002530.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Enrolment and Follow up profile.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0002530.g001"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Procedures</title><p>Administration of the first dose of study drugs was supervised by a study nurse and the administration of subsequent doses was supervised by study field workers. All children were given iron along with antimalarials according to national treatment guidelines. Caretakers of children in the AL group were told about the need to give a fatty meal along with the drug. Children were actively followed up at their homes by 10 field workers on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14 and 28 post treatment to solicit adverse events. Finger prick blood samples for parasitological observations were obtained on days 3, 7, 14, 28, for haematological measurements on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 28 and for biochemical assessments on days 2, 7, 28 (0.7ml of capillary blood) after the start of treatment. Blood samples were collected from children who attended the study clinic for suspected malaria on any other day outside the scheduled days of follow up.

Co-blistered packs of artesunate and amodiaquine (Arsucam,&#x000ae; Sanofi-Aventis), artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem,<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> Novartis) and chlorproguanil-dapsone (Lapdap,&#x02122; GlaxoSmithKline) were obtained from the respective local suppliers.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Statistical Methods</title><p>Data were double-entered, and validated using Visual Foxpro<sup>&#x000a9;</sup> 6.0.and the analysis was done using Stata&#x02122; 9.1. Per protocol analysis included patients who were properly randomised, had received the study drugs according to the protocol, and for whom data were available on the primary end point (ACPR28). Intention to treat (ITT) analysis involved all randomised patients irrespective of how many doses of the study drugs had been given but excluded all major day 0 protocol violations. All statistical tests were two-sided and an &#x003b1;-level &#x0003c;0.05 was considered a statistically significant result. For comparisons of continuous variables between groups, the t-test was used and for comparisons between more than two groups, one-way analysis of variance was used after assuring normality and homogeneity of variances assumptions were satisfied. For comparison of categorical variables, the chi-square test was used with the exact extension invoked when there were small numbers in the cells. A survival analysis using the life table method was done on the cumulative proportion of children having treatment failure at different time points during the post treatment period in each of the arms of the study. The end points were any of the following: failure to take the drug on any of the first three days, parasitaemia on day 2 greater than that on day 0, presence of parasitaemia on day 7, diagnosis of severe malaria at any point after day 0, recurrent parasitaemia after day 7 up to day 28. The likelihood-ratio test statistic of homogeneity and the logrank tests of homogeneity of arm were also carried out.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Sample size</title><p>The primary endpoint was PCR corrected ACPR by day 28.

The parasite density per micro-litre was estimated by multiplying the number of parasites per 200 leukocytes by a factor of 40, assuming a white blood cell count of 8,000/&#x003bc;l. Each blood slide was read by two microscopists. If the difference in the parasite density estimated by the two microscopists was &#x0003c;50&#x00025;, the mean of the two readings was defined as the true parasite density. If the disagreement between the two readings was &#x02265;50&#x00025;, a third microscopist examined the slide and the mean of the two closest readings was deemed to be the true parasite density. To distinguish between recrudescent and new infections, parasites identified on Days 14 and 28 were compared to those identified at enrolment using PCR amplification of <italic>msp2 P. falciparum</italic> genes. Full blood count and biochemical tests were done by calibrated automated ABX MICROS 60 (Horiba ABX, France) and Selectra E Clinical Chemistry Analyzer (Vital Scientific N.V, Netherlands) respectively. Quantitative G6PD phenotype analysis was conducted using Randox method with Humalyser Junior (Human, Germany).</p><p>Plasma ALT, AST, Total Bilirubin, Creatinine and Urea were measured on the Selectra E Clinical Chemistry analyzer (Vital Scientific, The Netherlands) using reagents from Elitech Diagnostics (Sees, France). ALT and AST were measured using the kinetic, UV, IFCC method without pyridoxal phosphate, total bilirubin with the modified Evelyn-Malloy method, creatinine with the kinetic Jaffe method and urea with the kinetic urease method. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) activity was measured using a quantitative UV G6PD kit from Randox (Antrium, UK). The enzyme activity was determined by the measurement of the rate of absorbance change at 340 nm due to the reduction of NADP<sup>&#x0002b;</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s2g"><title>Ethics</title><p>The study protocol was approved by the ethics committees of the Kintmapo Health Research Centre, Ghana Ministry of Health and the London School of Hygiene &#x00026; Tropical Medicine.

Our PCR corrected parasitological failure rate at day 28 is higher than that previously reported from Ghana<xref rid="pone.0002530-Koram1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> for AS&#x0002b;AQ (6.6&#x00025; vs 2.5&#x00025;) and remarkably higher for AL (13.8&#x00025; vs 0&#x00025;). The reason for the substantially higher parasitological failure at day 28 for AL compared to the results of a previous study in Ghana<xref rid="pone.0002530-Koram1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> and elsewhere<xref rid="pone.0002530-Mutabingwa1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref> is unclear. Dietary differences between our population and the previously studied populations is a possible explanation for this difference; poor absorption of AL leading to a higher parasitological failure compared to that reported from elsewhere. We did not follow the recommended practice of administering AL with a fatty diet in a clinical trial; instead we only advised caretakers to give fatty food at the time of drug administration. This was a pragmatic decision because in routine health care setting one can only advise a caretaker to administer AL with a fatty meal. Thus, the observed higher treatment failure of AL observed in our study compared with others may have been due to the lack of intake of fat along with AL, as is likely to happen frequently in routine clinical practice.</p><p>Although there was a significant difference in the parasitological failure rate (both recrudescence and re-infections) at day 28 between AL and AS&#x0002b;AQ, there was no difference in the clinical failure between the two groups, perhaps because both combinations contain a fast acting artemisinin.</p><p>The parasitological or clinical failure of AS&#x0002b;CD by day 14 was 8&#x00025; and by day 28 (PCR corrected) was 13.8&#x00025; in our study population. There are no other published studies of efficacy of AS&#x0002b;CD with which to compare these results. An earlier multicountry trial of CD monotherapy showed a parasitological or clinical failure rate of 5&#x00025; by day 14 in Nigeria.<xref rid="pone.0002530-Alloueche1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref> Our study suggests that adding AS to CD may have little value in West Africa given that the PCR corrected failure rate by day 28 has already reached 13.8&#x00025;. Surprisingly, the PCR corrected failure rate by day 28 for AL was also 13.8&#x00025; and this suggests that introducing AL as a replacement for AS&#x0002b;AQ needs to considered with caution. More evidence on the efficacy of AL in Ghana is needed urgently.</p><p>In the AL group, all children who had gametocytes on day 0 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;11) had cleared gametocytes by day 3 post treatment; gametocytes appeared in the blood of two children between day 14 and 28. In children in the AS&#x0002b;AQ group who had gametocytes on day 0 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;10) only one child had gametocytes on day 3 and 7. Two more children developed gametocytaemia by day 7 but all children cleared gametocytes by day 14. In children in the AS&#x0002b;CD group who had gametocytes on day 0 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;16) 4 children had gametocytes on day 3 and one child had gametocytes on day 7 Gametocytes appeared in a further child by day 7 but all children had cleared gametocytes by day 14; two children had developed gametocytes between day 14 an 28. It appears that all three ACTs tested in this study are effective at clearing gametocytes and this property of ACTs should have an effect on the transmission of malaria.</p><p>A slight reduction in the Hb concentration occured during the early post treatment period in all three treatment groups. Although differences were not remarkable, the recovery of Hb was slowest following treatment with AS&#x0002b;CD. There was no difference in the risk of haemolysis between the three ACTs in G6PD normal children. However, we cannot comment about the potential risk of haemolysis associated with AS&#x0002b;CD in an unselected population because G6PD deficient children were not included in the AS&#x0002b;CD arm. Results from recently completed multicentre trials indicate that coformulated AS&#x0002b;CD can cause serious haemolysis in children who are G6PD deficient so further development of this drug combination has been halted.</p><p>Our study results supports the current policy of AS&#x0002b;AQ as first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Ghana. However, the slightly higher incidence of adverse events, particularly vomiting and body pain, associated with use of AS&#x0002b;AQ is a concern. If these adverse events are common in adults as well then they might reduce adherence to a full course of the treatment. There were some reports of adverse events of AQ in the Ghanaian mass media and this has lead to the general public being reluctant to accept AS&#x0002b;AQ combination therapy. Although the overall incidence of adverse events related to AS&#x0002b;AQ group is reasonable, in order to achieve a good compliance an appropriate communication strategy is needed in addition to the introduction of the new fixed combinations of artesunate plus amodiaquine that are currently being developed.</p><p>We conclude that AS&#x0002b;AQ is an appropriate first line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in Ghana and possibly in neighbouring countries in West Africa. However, the deployment of AS&#x0002b;AQ should be linked to a clear information strategy regarding the potential mild adverse events for health care providers and the general public. The efficacy and safety of AL when given in the context of routine care need to be further studied in Ghana and elsewhere in West Africa.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002530.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>Trial Protocol.</p><p>(0.29 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002530.s001.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0002530.s002"><label>Checklist S1</label><caption><p>CONSORT Checklist.</p><p>(0.06 MB DOC)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0002530.s002.doc"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We are grateful to the community members of the Kintampo north and south districts for allowing their children to participate in this trial and to the Kintampo district hospital staff for providing medical and nursing care.
