These negative emotions intertwined with intensive pain, difficulty breathing, loss of appetite, and other physical symptoms, are seriously affecting the quality of life of patients, leading some of them to generate suicidal ideation from time to time. Evidence of other literature has reported that the suicide risk in cancer patients is 1.3&#x02013;2.8 times higher than in the normal population,<xref rid="b2-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> and advanced cancer patients might have an even higher risk of committing suicide.<xref rid="b3-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In our present study, we implemented a mental clinical nursing pathway for patients with malignant tumors during hospitalization, and used the &#x0201c;self-rating idea of suicide scale&#x0201d; (SIOSS) and Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) for assessing the intervention effects of a mental clinical nursing pathway.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Patients and methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Two hundred patients with malignant tumors were admitted in the Cancer Center of Zhongda Hospital from February 2011 to December 2013, and all enrolled patients provided written informed consent. Inclusion criteria for patient recruitment were as follows: pathological or cytological diagnosis of patients with malignant tumor (without tumor type restrictions), no previous history of mental illness, voluntary collaborators, and expectation of surviving 3 months or more. The patients were randomly divided into two groups, 100 cases formed the study group and 100 cases formed the control group. During the treatment, patients in the study group were given the mental clinical nursing pathway, while those in the control group were given the usual nursing care, such as timely inspection, nurse&#x02019;s reactions to patient&#x02019;s behavior, and execution of medical orders.</p></sec><sec><title>Research tools</title><sec><title>General situation questionnaire</title><p>The questionnaire survey covers general information and tumor specialized subject information. The form includes age, sex, marital status, occupation, level of education, average family income, and source of medical expenses; the latter information includes tumor type, stage, metastasis, duration, informed situation, existence of pain, and previous treatment history.</p></sec><sec><title>SIOSS</title><p>Based on the widely used questionnaires of suicidal ideation, such as Beck Depression Inventory, Self-rating Depression Scale, Self-Rating Anxiety Scale, Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, Symptom Check List 90, and Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory used in the Editorial Board of Chinese Behavioral Medicine&#x02019;s work, the SIOSS was established by our clinical practice experience.<xref rid="b4-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The scale includes despair factor, optimistic factor, sleep factor, and cover factor, and the total score of suicidal ideation factor was the sum of the four factors. The higher the score, the stronger the suicidal ideation. If the cover factor score was more than four points, it was not reliable to measure. According to the results of statistical tests and our observations, the scale, which had a good validity and reliability, was simple, rapid, effective, and suitable for Chinese self-rating scale screening for suicidal ideation.<xref rid="b4-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p></sec><sec><title>KPS</title><p>The scale was proposed firstly in 1948 by Mor et al and mainly used to measure the physical performance status of cancer patients.<xref rid="b5-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> KPS is divided into ten levels and has a higher rate of reliability and structural validity. In our present study, it was mainly used to assess cancer patients&#x02019; quality of life by the intervention of mental clinical nursing pathway.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Questionnaire survey procedure and method</title><p>First, professional nurses were trained by the oncology psychiatrist on how to conduct the questionnaire survey, such as the interpretation of each item, language communication skills, and avoidance skills of sensitive issues. Once patients&#x02019; written informed consent was obtained, questionnaires were given to them and answered independently. General information of the questionnaire, SIOSS, and KPS were recorded on the first day of admission, and then the SIOSS and KPS were recorded again 14 days after admission.</p></sec><sec><title>Mental nursing clinical pathway</title><p>The clinical pathway chart was worked out by doctors and nurses, and the psychological care was performed from admission to discharge by the responsible nurse according to the planned route of work program. Implementation of clinical psychological nursing path was mainly done by conversational communication and language communication, and symptomatic medications were given to the patients when necessary under the advice of physicians, such as sedative hypnotic drugs, antidepressants, analgesics, antiemetic drugs, and nutritional support etc. Psychological nursing time required was more than 20 minutes per day during the first week and then more than 20 minutes every 2 days during the second week in hospital. The stages of the mental nursing clinical pathway are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f1-ppa-8-1665">Figure 1</xref>. In addition, we could identify the patients who urgently needed suicide crisis intervention according to the suicidal ideation score. For these patients, except for the clinical pathway of psychological nursing, we should keep timely contact with patients&#x02019; families who will care for them every day. Notably, we should also strengthen ward patrols and safety inspections, and keep the patients away from dangerous objects to protect patients&#x02019; safety and reduce the suicide rate.<xref rid="b6-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

As we know, the indicator only assesses the direct health burden caused by individual death or self-injury, and does not include the serious and continuous negative psychological impact caused by suicide on victims&#x02019; family members and friends. Because of the stimulation of negative life events and physical discomfort including long-term pain, difficulty in breathing, and loss of appetite, suicidal ideation is particularly prominent in cancer patients. Therefore, preventing suicidal behavior in patients with malignant tumors is one of the most important tasks for oncology clinical staff.</p><p>Suicide is not only the result of interaction of many factors such as psychological, social, and biological, but also a product of interaction between personal qualities and stress under the control of mutual growth along with the decline of risk factors and protective factors. Several studies have identified increased suicide rates among patients with cancer,<xref rid="b6-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b10-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> who are at greater risk of suicidal ideation than the general population.<xref rid="b11-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Thus, a targeted solution to psychological crisis factors such as the increase in the number of social support systems, the improvement of the patient&#x02019;s ability to solve problems, and the development of their courage and self-confidence, are effective measures to reduce suicide risk in patients with malignant tumors.<xref rid="b6-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="b12-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="b13-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Due to the special nature of nursing work, the nurses in the hospital usually spend more time with patients than other workers, so they have obvious advantages in psychological treatment of patients in daily work. But there are still a number of problems concerning psychological care, such as the lack of objective and effective psychological assessment, the lack of specific and common standardized care plans and procedures, unclear psychological nursing diagnosis, and lower feasibility of implementation of psychological nursing.<xref rid="b14-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> Early detection and treatment are the best ways to prevent suicidal ideation and suicide attempts. In the present study, SIOSS was used to assess the psychological state of cancer patients and a clinical application pathway theory was used to develop a detailed and standardized psychological care pattern to improve the initiative of nursing work, enhance the comparability and operability of the job, and reduce the randomness, aimlessness, and unnecessary duplication of nursing processes. Notably, the application of a mental clinical nursing pathway in our present study could regulate malignant tumor patients&#x02019; nursing care, identify suicide risks as soon as possible, implement timely intervention measures, improve the degree of suicidal ideation in patients, and reduce the suicide rate in hospitalized patients with malignant tumors. Importantly, the result of the Spearman&#x02019;s correlation analysis suggests that the patients&#x02019; suicidal ideation was negatively correlated with KPS. The results of KPS showed that the application of a mental clinical nursing pathway could reduce patients&#x02019; suicidal ideation and significantly improve the patients&#x02019; quality of life as well as the medical treatment.</p><p>As we know, the idea of a mental clinical nursing pathway in clinical work has not yet been universal, and psychological changes during different periods in patients with tumors are larger. Therefore, a mental clinical nursing pathway still needs to be constantly adjusted and revised to improve the practicality and normativity of psychological intervention. In addition, suicide is the result of multiple factors&#x02019; interaction. Evidence in other literature suggests that depression and anxiety, and advanced tumor pain and dysfunction, are the two main causes of cancer patients&#x02019; suicide or suicidal tendencies.<xref rid="b15-ppa-8-1665" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Additionally, if a patient has a comorbid psychiatric disorder, it may be difficult to find a medication that addresses both the psychiatric disorder and suicidal ideation. Thus, it is very important for medical workers to treat the primary disease, especially pain control and recovery of function in patients with malignant tumors. In particular, additional drug therapy is necessary for those patients with severe mental disorders, and suicide crisis intervention should also be adopted to reduce the incidence of suicide.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was financially supported by Key Department of Jiangsu Medicine (2012&#x02013;12).</p></ack><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>The authors report no conflicts of interest in this work.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="b1-ppa-8-1665"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>World Health Organization, Department of Chronic Diseases and Health Promotion</collab></person-group><source>National cancer control programs: policies and managerial guidelines</source><edition>2nd edition</edition><publisher-name>Health and Development Networks</publisher-name><year>2002</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b2-ppa-8-1665"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Tanaka</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Tsukuma</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Masaoka</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Suicide risk among cancer patients: experience at one medical center in Japan, 1978&#x02013;1994</article-title><source>Jpn J Cancer Res</source><year>1999</year><volume>90</volume><issue>8</issue><fpage>812</fpage><lpage>817</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">10543251</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b3-ppa-8-1665"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Akechi</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Okuyama</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Sugawara</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Nakano</surname><given-names>T</given-names></name><name><surname>Shima</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Uchitomi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Suicidality in terminally ill Japanese patients with cancer</article-title><source>Cancer</source><year>2004</year><volume>100</volume><issue>1</issue><fpage>183</fpage><lpage>191</lpage><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">14692039</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="b4-ppa-8-1665"><label>4</label><element-citation publication-type="book"><person-group person-group-type="author"><collab>Editorial Board of Chinese Behavioral Medicine</collab></person-group><source>Behavioral medicine inventory manual</source><publisher-loc>Beijing</publisher-loc><publisher-name>The Chinese Medicine Electronic Audio and Video Publishing House</publisher-name><year>2005</year></element-citation></ref><ref id="b5-ppa-8-1665"><label>5</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Mor</surname><given-names>V</given-names></name><name><surname>Laliberte</surname><given-names>L</given-names></name><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>JN</given-names></name><name><surname>Wiemann</surname><given-names>M</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>The Karnofsky Performance Status Scale.
