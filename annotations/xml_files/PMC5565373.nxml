The primary outcome was the difference in percentage change of serum FGF23 levels from baseline between the two groups. Secondary end points included the changes in serum levels of calcium, phosphate, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and 25-hydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> (25(OH)D) from baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Serum FGF23 levels were more elevated in the combination group than in the calcitriol-alone group. However, both mean change and percentage change in the serum FGF23 levels during the 8-week period were not significantly different between the two groups. Serum calcium level was increased significantly only in the combination treatment group. There was no significant difference in percentage change of serum calcium levels between the two groups. In addition, changes in serum levels of phosphate, 25(OH)D, or PTH were not significantly different between the two groups. In correlation analysis, changes in serum FGF23 levels were positively correlated with changes in serum calcium and phosphate levels, but not with changes in 25(OH)D or PTH levels. No serious adverse events were observed, however, there was one case of mild gastrointestinal discomfort.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>This study revealed that additional calcium carbonate treatment significantly increased serum FGF23 levels in patients treated with calcitriol, with their synergistic effect in promoting intestinal calcium absorption. This suggests that serum FGF23 levels should be monitored regularly, especially in those who use combination of vitamin D and calcium carbonate from the early stages of CKD.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>fibroblast growth factor-23</kwd><kwd>vitamin D deficiency</kwd><kwd>calcium carbonate</kwd><kwd>calcitriol</kwd><kwd>mineral and bone disorder</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Vitamin D deficiency is highly prevalent in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD), and it can be exacerbated in renal failure.<xref rid="b1-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> It has been known that vitamin D deficiency itself affects calcium, phosphorus, and bone metabolism, referred to as chronic kidney disease&#x02013;mineral and bone disorder (CKD-MBD).<xref rid="b2-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In addition, vitamin D deficiency leads to increased parathyroid hormone (PTH) secretion, high bone turnover, and cardiovascular risks.<xref rid="b3-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b5-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> In this regard, vitamin D supplementation is recommended for early CKD patients to delay the progression of CKD-MBD by maintaining adequate vitamin D levels.<xref rid="b6-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> In these patients, monitoring of vitamin D and PTH levels is required to assess the efficacy of vitamin D treatment and identify the progression of CKD-MBD. However, since PTH changes at 3&#x02013;6 months after vitamin D treatment,<xref rid="b6-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> serum PTH level would not be a direct indicator of vitamin D efficacy. In addition, the change in the PTH level is small at the initial stage of CKD, so the progress of CKD-MBD cannot be evaluated only by PTH level. Thus, a new parameter is needed to evaluate and predict CKD-MBD in patients with slightly reduced renal function.<xref rid="b7-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Recent studies have indicated that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) plays a role in the regulation of mineral and bone metabolism from initial stage of CKD.<xref rid="b5-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b8-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="b9-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Elevation in serum levels of FGF23 and increased calcium and phosphorus levels are frequently observed in patients with active vitamin D treatment (eg, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub> [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D]; calcitriol).<xref rid="b5-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Therefore, a change in FGF23 levels might be considered as an early indicator of MBD in CKD patients treated with vitamin D analog.<xref rid="b9-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> High FGF23 is associated with atrial fibrillation, incidence of osteomalacia, faster disease progression in CKD,<xref rid="b10-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> and increased mortality.<xref rid="b11-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="b12-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Several previous studies have demonstrated that various factors including dietary calcium and phosphate intake, vitamin D production, and PTH levels can increase the change in serum FGF23 levels.

Especially, it is currently unclear how FGF23 and PTH change as biomarkers of MBD in early CKD patients who are administered calcium and calcitriol together.

During the study period, the calcium and calcitriol combination treatment group showed a significant increase in both serum FGF23 level and calcium level, compared to the calcitriol treatment-alone group. These results suggest that additional calcium carbonate might result in upregulation of serum FGF23 levels by acting as a calcium supplement rather than as a phosphorus binder.</p><p>Several reasons might explain why FGF23 level was elevated when calcium and vitamin D were used together in CKD patients. First, activated vitamin D can regulate FGF23 expression and potentially regulate PTH. In both animal and human studies, administration of calcitriol has increased serum FGF23 levels due to a direct or indirect action of vitamin D on FGF23. For example, calcitriol acts directly on a vitamin D response element (VDRE) located upstream of the FGF23 promoter,<xref rid="b25-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="b26-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> resulting in the production of FGF23.<xref rid="b27-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In addition, calcitriol promotes the synthesis of epithelial calcium channels<xref rid="b28-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b29-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> and activates the plasma membrane calcium pumps.<xref rid="b30-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="b31-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> It can also induce the formation of calcium-binding proteins.<xref rid="b32-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> These mechanisms can induce calcium absorption from the gastrointestinal tract, which might continuously stimulate FGF23 release.<xref rid="b5-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> Burnett-Bowie et al<xref rid="b33-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and Alvarez et al<xref rid="b34-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> have reported that FGF23 levels are significantly increased after 12 weeks of ergocalciferol or cholecalciferol treatment at 50,000 international units (IUs) in contrast with placebo carried out in patients with relatively normal kidney functions. Wesseling-Perry et al<xref rid="b35-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> have also demonstrated that FGF23 levels are increased after treatment with either calcitriol or doxercalciferol using various amounts of vitamin D supplementation. These results suggest that the absorbed amount of vitamin D can influence the concentration of FGF23, regardless of renal function of patients. However, we did not observe the significant elevation in FGF23 levels in calcitriol-alone group. This was probably due to difference in absorbed amounts of vitamin D. In fact, amounts of vitamin D analogs in the studies by Burnett-Bowie et al<xref rid="b33-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> and Alvarez et al<xref rid="b34-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> were very high when they were converted to the equivalent doses of calcitriol.</p><p>Second, administration of calcium may itself induce a rise in circulating FGF23, independent of vitamin D. Vervloet et al<xref rid="b36-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">36</xref> have reported that serum FGF23 levels are increased during high dietary calcium intake, whereas levels of both PTH and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D are decreased. Kobayashi et al<xref rid="b37-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> have reported that calcium supplementation can significantly increase FGF23 mRNA abundance independent of vitamin D concentration using vitamin-D-receptor null mice. These studies suggest that serum calcium has positive and significant correlation with FGF23 level. Similarly, serum FGF23 levels are decreased at hypocalcemic status despite high PTH and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D levels.<xref rid="b38-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">38</xref> However, as noted earlier, FGF23 was not significantly increased in studies using calcium acetate. This was probably due to low amount of elemental calcium in calcium acetate. Calcium acetate contains less elemental calcium than calcium carbonate (25% versus 40%, respectively),<xref rid="b6-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> although it has superior phosphate-binding capacity than calcium carbonate.<xref rid="b39-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> Thus, contents of calcium in calcium carbonate might have outbalanced the effect of phosphorous binding, resulting in more increase in serum FGF23 levels.</p><p>Finally, in our study, the significant increase in serum FGF23 levels following combination use of calcitriol and calcium carbonate might reflect that vitamin D could facilitate calcium absorption. As described earlier, when calcitriol is combined with calcium, calcium uptake in the gastrointestinal tract is promoted, leading to elevated calcium levels in the blood. These results were also observed in our study, in which serum calcium level was significantly elevated after 8 weeks in the combination treatment group. The stimulatory effect of calcium was further enhanced by vitamin D analog. This consequently suggests that the risk of adverse effects might be higher due to elevated FGF23 levels.</p><p>Meanwhile, despite these changes in calcium and FGF23 levels, no significant change in serum levels of phosphorus or PTH was observed in our study. Previous study has shown that vitamin D could suppress PTH directly in the parathyroid gland.<xref rid="b40-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> However, in our study, only the combination treatment group lowered serum PTH levels from baseline compared to the calcitriol-alone group, although not statistically significant. It seems that the combination of vitamin D and calcium suppresses PTH directly or indirectly by increasing calcium concentration. Serum phosphorus concentration was not significantly changed in either group during the study period. These results indicate that effects of vitamin D analog on FGF23 are not likely to be mediated by changes in serum phosphorus or PTH level. Rather, they might be mediated directly by serum calcium levels in early CKD patients. Since calcium acts directly on calcium-sensing receptor of parathyroid glands to inhibit the secretion of PTH,<xref rid="b41-tcrm-13-999" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> elevated calcium might inhibit PTH secretion. Therefore, it is more important to monitor serum FGF23 levels and serum levels of phosphorus, vitamin D, or PTH status in the patients under vitamin D and calcium treatments.</p><p>To the best our knowledge, this is a well-done study that identifies the stimulatory effect of additional calcium on changes in serum FGF23 levels. In addition, our correlation analysis suggests that change in serum calcium level is a potential biomarker for prediction of increased FGF23 in patients treated with vitamin D analogs and/or calcium-based phosphate binders. This new insight can be applied to clinical practice for predicting the risk of cardiovascular diseases related to high FGF23 levels. Nevertheless, our study had some limitations. We could not identify the involvement of FGF23 levels in bone metabolism change, a direct marker of CKD-MBD. This might be due to the relatively small number of patients used in this study with a relative short period of monitoring for the formation and degradation of bone. Although assumptions made in calculating sample size estimations were performed based on a previous study, the small number of patients might have limited us in achieving results of greater power. In addition, as mentioned earlier, because we used a relatively small dose of calcitriol, the absorbed amount of vitamin D might be low. Thus, larger randomized controlled trials of vitamin D analogs at various doses are needed in the future to achieve improved results. Further studies are warranted to determine the long-term clinical impact of combination treatment on serum levels of FGF23 associated with cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Additional calcium carbonate to calcitriol treatment showed greater effects on changes in serum FGF23 levels than calcitriol alone. This might be due to synergistic effect between calcium carbonate and calcitriol by increasing intestinal calcium absorption. Our results suggest that it is important to regularly monitor serum calcium and FGF23 levels in patients having risk of increased calcium absorption due to combination treatment with calcium carbonate and calcitriol, even if their serum phosphorus levels are within normal range.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This work was supported by a National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant, funded by the Korean government (MEST; NRF-2009-0081414) and the Ministry of Science, ICT &#x00026; Future Planning (NRF-2014M3C1B3064644), and by the BK21 Plus Program.
