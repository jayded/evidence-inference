Therefore, glycemic control is fundamental to type 2 diabetes treatment. Since the effects of structured exercise training on glycemic control have been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>), exercise is considered a cornerstone in type 2 diabetes treatment.</p><p>A single bout of exercise lowers circulating blood glucose concentrations and reduces the prevalence of hyperglycemic episodes throughout the subsequent day in type 2 diabetic patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>). These glucoregulatory properties of exercise are attributable to an increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity, which has been reported to persist for up to 48 h following a single bout of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>). As such, the benefits of exercise on long-term glycemic control (i.e., HbA<sub>1c</sub>) can be largely ascribed to the cumulative glucoregulatory effects of each successive bout of exercise, rather than the structural adaptive response to prolonged exercise training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). In fact, the effects of more prolonged exercise training on insulin sensitivity may be lost entirely 6&#x02013;8 days after cessation of training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>). Therefore, regular exercise is warranted to improve and/or maintain long-term glycemic control. This is also recognized by the recently updated exercise guidelines of the American College of Sports Medicine and the American Diabetes Association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>), which state that exercise should be performed at least 3 days/week with no more than two consecutive days between exercise bouts.</p><p>Given the short-lived character of exercise-induced improvements in insulin action, it has even been speculated that daily exercise would be the preferred frequency of exercise to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). However, since most exercise intervention studies typically divided the total amount of exercise over three exercise sessions per week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), it is presently unclear whether daily exercise sessions provide an equal or additional benefit with respect to glycemic control compared with a less frequent exercise regimen. Moreover, shorter daily exercise sessions may be preferred over less frequent bouts of a longer duration in more compromised type 2 diabetic patients. These patients are commonly characterized by a high prevalence of cardiovascular comorbidities, polyneuropathy, and/or reduced exercise tolerance, which generally reduce the capacity to perform more prolonged bouts of exercise. More information on the preferred frequency of exercise would provide health care professionals with a useful instrument to individualize and, as such, optimize exercise intervention programs to treat type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The current study investigates the impact of daily exercise versus exercise performed every other day on glycemic control throughout the day in insulin-treated and non&#x02013;insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients. For this purpose, we applied continuous glucose monitoring under standardized dietary, but otherwise free-living, conditions over a 48-h period during which patients performed no exercise (control) or 60 min of cycling exercise distributed either as a single session performed every other day (nondaily) or as 30 min of exercise performed daily (daily). We hypothesized that daily exercise improves blood glucose homeostasis to a greater extent compared with the same amount of exercise performed every other day.</p><sec id="s2"><title>RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS</title><p>Thirty male type 2 diabetic patients were recruited to participate in a randomized crossover study. Both non&#x02013;insulin-treated (<italic>n</italic> = 16) and insulin-treated (<italic>n</italic> = 14) type 2 diabetic patients were selected. Exclusion criteria were self-reported renal failure and liver disease (hepatitis and cirrhosis), morbid obesity (BMI &#x0003e;40 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), uncontrolled hypertension (&#x0003e;160 mmHg systolic and/or &#x0003e;100 mmHg diastolic blood pressure), and a history of severe cardiovascular problems (myocardial infarction in the last year or stroke). All subjects were informed of the nature and the risks of the experimental procedures before their written informed consent was obtained. The medical ethics committee of the Maastricht University Medical Centre+ approved all clinical experiments.</p><sec id="s3"><title>Screening and pretesting</title><p>Non&#x02013;insulin-treated patients performed an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medication was withheld 2 days prior to the OGTT. After an overnight fast, subjects arrived at the laboratory at 8:00 <sc>a.m</sc>. by car or public transportation. A fasting blood sample was obtained, after which the OGTT was performed to determine type 2 diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association criteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>). Insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients were screened with a basal blood sample to determine their fasting plasma glucose concentration and HbA<sub>1c</sub> level. After blood sampling, maximal workload capacity (W<sub>max</sub>) was determined with an electromagnetically braked cycle ergometer (Lode Excalibur, Groningen, the Netherlands) during an incremental exhaustive exercise test. Cardiac function was monitored using a 12-lead electrocardiogram.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Study design</title><p>Subjects participated in a randomized crossover study consisting of three intervention periods separated by at least 4 days.

All intervention periods were identical with the exception of the frequency and duration of the exercise sessions. During one intervention period (nondaily), a single 60-min bout of exercise was performed at the beginning of the 48-h assessment. In the other intervention period (daily), the same amount of exercise was performed via two exercise sessions of 30 min each. The first 30-min session was performed at the beginning of the 48-h assessment and the second session exactly 24 h later. In a third intervention period (control), subjects performed no exercise at all.</p><fig id="F1" fig-type="figure" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Schematic overview of an experimental period.

The diet consisted of three meals and three snacks per day, distributed in preweighed packages and ingested at predetermined time points to ensure a fully standardized diet. The diet provided 10.3 &#x000b1; 0.1 MJ/day consisting of 55% of energy from carbohydrate, 14% from protein, and 31% from fat. The diet was designed to meet the individual energy requirements as calculated with the Harris and Benedict equation (1918) multiplied with a physical activity level value of 1.4.

A single bout of merely 30 min of exercise is shown to substantially reduce the prevalence of hyperglycemia throughout the subsequent day. Thirty minutes of daily exercise is as effective as more prolonged 60-min bouts of exercise performed every other day to optimize glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients.</p><p>The current study confirms previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>) showing that postprandial hyperglycemia is a largely underestimated problem in type 2 diabetes treatment. Despite the continued use of blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medication and the provision of a healthy, well-balanced diet, type 2 diabetic patients were shown to experience hyperglycemia for as much as 32 &#x000b1; 4% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). This finding translates to 7:40 &#x000b1; 1:00 h:min per day during which blood glucose levels exceeded 10 mmol/L. The prevalence of hyperglycemia was comparable in the insulin-treated and non&#x02013;insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients (7:54 &#x000b1; 1:23 and 7:27 &#x000b1; 1:34 h:min per day, respectively), suggesting that neither oral blood glucose&#x02013;lowering medication nor exogenous insulin provides sufficient protection against postprandial hyperglycemia. Given the strong and independent relationship between postprandial blood glucose increments and cardiovascular events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>), more effective management of postprandial hyperglycemia is warranted.</p><p>In the current study, we show that just 30 min of moderate-intensity exercise substantially reduces the prevalence of hyperglycemia throughout the subsequent day. A single bout of exercise reduced the prevalence of hyperglycemic episodes by nearly 2 h, from 7:40 &#x000b1; 1:00 to 5:46 &#x000b1; 0:58 h:min per day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>B</italic></xref>). Moreover, average blood glucose concentrations throughout the subsequent day were reduced by 0.8 mmol/L: from 9.1 to 8.3 mmol/L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3<italic>A</italic></xref>). These profound effects of such a short exercise bout seem to be of a magnitude similar to those reported in previous studies following more prolonged bouts of exercise in both insulin-treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) and non&#x02013;insulin-treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>) type 2 diabetic patients. Clearly, the prescription of just 30 min of daily exercise represents an effective interventional strategy to reduce hyperglycemia and improve daily glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients. As such, the present findings highlight the clinical relevance of exercising at least 30 min per day, which has been advocated by many exercise guidelines as the minimal daily amount of exercise to promote and/or maintain optimal health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>).</p><p>The current study further extends on previous work in this area by investigating the impact of the frequency of exercise on glycemic control throughout the day. A single bout of exercise stimulates blood glucose disposal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>) and induces a transient increase in whole-body insulin sensitivity for up to 48 h (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>). Consequently, it has been speculated that performing exercise on a daily basis may be of even greater benefit with respect to glycemic control compared with exercise bouts performed less frequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>). Therefore, in the current study we compared the impact of 30-min bouts of exercise performed daily with more prolonged 60-min bouts of exercise performed every other day on subsequent glycemic control. The daily bouts of exercise were shown to be equally effective in lowering postprandial hyperglycemia as the more prolonged bouts of exercise performed every other day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>). Thus, when total work is being matched, daily exercise of short duration is equally effective as more prolonged bouts of exercise performed less frequently. Consequently, when exercise is not performed every day, patients can compensate by performing more prolonged bouts of exercise every other day.</p><p>Both moderate-intensity exercise and high-intensity exercise performed in the postprandial state have been shown to acutely decrease postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>). In the current study, moderate-intensity exercise was initiated in the early postprandial phase, 90 min after breakfast. Postprandial plasma glucose and insulin concentrations obtained 150 min after breakfast were substantially lower when prior exercise was performed. Interestingly, both plasma glucose and insulin concentrations obtained in this acute postprandial phase were shown to be reduced in a dose-dependent manner after performing 30 or 60 min of exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>). The attenuated rise in postprandial plasma glucose concentrations following exercise is attributed to a greater glucose uptake and subsequent storage and/or oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>). The concomitant reduction in circulating insulin levels clearly reflects the impact of exercise on stimulating insulin-independent glucose disposal. In contrast to the acute phase, a dose-response effect was not observed over the entire 24 h period following exercise. Both the 30- and 60-min exercise bouts were equally effective in improving glycemic control throughout the subsequent day (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F3">Fig. 3</xref>).</p><p>The strong blood glucose&#x02013;lowering effects induced by exercise may be associated with an augmented risk of developing hypoglycemia in patients with advanced type 2 diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>). Particularly, the combined glucose-lowering effects of exercise and exogenous insulin or sulfonylureas may increase the risk for hypoglycemic episodes. Therefore, we also assessed the prevalence of hypoglycemia in both the insulin- and non&#x02013;insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients. Overall, the prevalence of hypoglycemia (here defined as blood glucose concentrations &#x0003c;3.9 mmol/L) was approximately threefold higher in the insulin- compared with the non&#x02013;insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients (between-group effect <italic>P</italic> = 0.012). However, exercise did not increase the prevalence of hypoglycemic episodes (main effect <italic>P</italic> = 0.63), and the response to exercise was not different between insulin- and non&#x02013;insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients (exercise &#x000d7; group interaction <italic>P</italic> = 0.54). The absence of any exercise-induced hypoglycemia is not surprising, as we ensured that dietary intake was well distributed over the day, with meals and/or snacks ingested prior to and immediately after exercise.</p><p>The current study holds several important implications for health care professionals. Frequent short bouts of exercise are equally effective to improve glycemic control as less frequent exercise bouts of a longer duration. Consequently, the total amount of work performed seems to be of prime importance with respect to glycemic control. This view is supported by a recent meta-analysis of Umpierre et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>), which demonstrated greater improvements in glycemic control (i.e., HbA<sub>1c</sub>) following structured exercise training with a total duration of &#x0003e;150 min per week as opposed to &#x0003c;150 min per week. The balance between the frequency and duration of exercise sessions, however, can be used as an instrument to optimize exercise prescription for the individual patient. Depending on the preference of the patient, the presence of comorbidities, and overall training status, more frequent short bouts of exercise can be substituted for less frequent exercise bouts of a longer duration or vice versa. Short bouts of exercise may be particularly useful for patients suffering from reduced exercise tolerance, polyneuropathy, and other diabetic comorbidities, such as micro- and macrovascular complications, which generally reduce the feasibility of performing more prolonged exercise. On the other hand, more prolonged bouts of exercise may offer a time-efficient alternative to daily exercise and might be more feasible for many other diabetic patients who have difficulty scheduling daily exercise in their work routine.</p><p>Caution should be taken when translating our findings to the entire population of patients with type 2 diabetes, since patients included in the current study were relatively healthy. Patients suffering from severe long-term complications and reduced exercise tolerance may not be able to perform exercise with the duration and intensity applied in the current study. It should be noted, however, that particularly these patients would benefit from the finding that frequent short bouts are equally effective with respect to glycemic control compared with more prolonged bouts of exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>). Nevertheless, the feasibility and effectiveness of an exercise regimen with frequent short bouts of exercise remain to be established in type 2 diabetic patients suffering from long-term complications.</p><p>In conclusion, 30 min of exercise substantially reduces the prevalence of hyperglycemia throughout the subsequent day in both insulin- and non&#x02013;insulin-treated type 2 diabetic patients. Short bouts of exercise performed on a daily basis are equally effective as more prolonged bouts of exercise performed every other day to improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetic patients.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn id="fn1"><p>Clinical trial reg. no.
