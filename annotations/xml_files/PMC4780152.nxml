However, randomised controlled trial data are limited. The &#x02018;Prostate Cancer: Evidence of Exercise and Nutrition Trial&#x02019; investigates the feasibility of recruiting and randomising men diagnosed with localised prostate cancer and eligible for radical prostatectomy to interventions that modify nutrition and physical activity. The primary outcomes are randomisation rates and adherence to the interventions at 6&#x000a0;months following randomisation. The secondary outcomes are intervention tolerability, trial retention, change in prostate specific antigen level, change in diet, change in general physical activity levels, insulin-like growth factor levels, and a range of related outcomes, including quality of life measures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>The trial is factorial, randomising men to both a physical activity (brisk walking or control) and nutritional (lycopene supplementation or increased fruit and vegetables with reduced dairy consumption or control) intervention. The trial has two phases: men are enrolled into a cohort study prior to radical prostatectomy, and then consented after radical prostatectomy into a randomised controlled trial. Data are collected at four time points (cohort baseline, true trial baseline and 3 and 6&#x000a0;months post-randomisation).</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The Prostate Cancer: Evidence of Exercise and Nutrition Trial aims to determine whether men with localised prostate cancer who are scheduled for radical prostatectomy can be recruited into a cohort and subsequently randomised to a 6-month nutrition and physical activity intervention trial. If successful, this feasibility trial will inform a larger trial to investigate whether this population will gain clinical benefit from long-term nutritional and physical activity interventions post-surgery.</p><p>Prostate Cancer: Evidence of Exercise and Nutrition Trial (PrEvENT) is registered on the ISRCTN registry, ref number ISRCTN99048944.

In many cases, localised prostate cancer is slow growing; however, an unpredictable proportion of men suffer more rapidly progressive, fatal disease.</p><p>A growing body of observational evidence suggests that certain nutritional and physical activity interventions are associated with beneficial outcomes for men with prostate cancer, such as improved quality of life, longer disease-free survival and reduced prostate cancer mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. In addition, a cancer diagnosis can provide a teachable moment during which an individual may be motivated to improve their health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>The Prostate Cancer: Evidence of Exercise and Nutrition Trial (PrEvENT) is a feasibility randomised controlled trial (RCT). PrEvENT investigates whether men who have undergone radical prostatectomy will adhere to a nutritional and physical activity intervention and explores the implications of the intervention on a range of surrogate outcomes.</p><p>The rationale for the interventions included in the trial is described below.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Physical activity</title><p>Observational studies suggest that moderate to vigorous physical activity is associated with reduced risk of biochemical recurrence and mortality in men with prostate cancer. For example 3&#x000a0;hours of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week was associated with a 61&#x000a0;% decrease in prostate cancer mortality compared with less than 1&#x000a0;hour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Prostate cancer most often becomes evident in older age when men may not always be able, or motivated, to participate in vigorous activity. Brisk walking is a potential alternative, as it provides exposure to moderate-intensity activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and has been associated with anti-cancer cellular behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Brisk walking does not require specialised equipment or training and is not location specific. A higher body mass index has been associated with poorer prostate cancer survival suggesting that promotion of physical activity may reduce cancer progression through weight control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Guidelines recommend that people with cancer do 30&#x000a0;minutes of moderate-intensity exercise 5&#x000a0;days per week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, the majority of men with prostate cancer do not meet these guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Lycopene</title><p>Lycopene is a carotenoid constituent of tomatoes with potential anti-cancer activity. In an observational study, men&#x02019;s intake of tomato sauce following a diagnosis of prostate cancer was associated with reduced risk of disease progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. A small trial (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;81) in men at high risk of prostate cancer demonstrated the acceptability and tolerability of lycopene supplements as tablets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, there is limited evidence from RCTs for the effect of lycopene when used as adjunct therapy in men with prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Plant-based diets</title><p>Vegetables and legumes have been associated with a lower risk of prostate cancer, and in some studies, they are associated with a reduced risk of advanced or aggressive disease at diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. They are thought to enhance immunity and inhibit cell growth, and consumption after diagnosis is associated with a reduced risk of progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Evidence of the relationship between fruit intake and prostate cancer progression is limited. However, both fruit and cruciferous vegetables are high in vitamin C and increased intake of vitamin C has been associated with clinical outcomes, such as reduced prostate cancer risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>], DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and maintained levels of PSA in men with biochemical recurrence of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Dairy products and soy milk</title><p>Observational evidence suggests that high intakes of dairy products and calcium, for example from cow&#x02019;s milk, could be associated with a greater risk of prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>], but the evidence is inconclusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Prostate cancer has been inversely associated with intake of soya and soya foods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Studies have reported decreased mean (PSA) levels in men with prostate cancer, who were supplemented with soy bread or soy and linseed bread, compared to supplementation with wheat bread [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Not all trials, however, have reported such PSA reductions in association with soy protein supplementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Empirical data informing the trial protocol</title><p>We conducted interviews to explore attitudes towards, and previous experience of, nutrition and physical activity interventions, as well as opinions about the proposed PrEvENT trial, with men following radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer, their partners and their healthcare professionals. These interviews provided evidence that although some men may not have much experience of such interventions, they would attempt to make changes, especially if they felt it would benefit them or influence future prostate cancer treatment. They were positive about the proposed intervention. However, potential barriers that the men highlighted, including treatment-related incontinence and aversions to certain food products were discussed and considered when developing the PrEvENT intervention. Results from the qualitative interviews are to be published elsewhere (Unpublished observations, Hackshaw-McGeagh et al.).</p><p>As well as incorporating the World Cancer Research Fund Continuous Update Project review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], we undertook a systematic review of the existing literature on the effect of dietary, nutritional and physical activity interventions on clinical outcomes in men with prostate cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. This review highlights the paucity of good quality RCT evidence and supports the development of feasibility and pilot RCTs to underpin the development of definitive trials in this area.</p><p>Based on existing evidence, we hypothesised that following radical prostatectomy for localised prostate cancer, men will accept, and adhere to, nutrition and physical activity interventions. The feasibility trial was developed with the intention of informing a larger trial of these interventions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methods/design</title><sec id="Sec8"><title>Trial setting and participants</title><p>The PrEvENT trial has a 2 x 3 factorial design (resulting in six different experimental conditions), where men are randomised to levels of both a physical activity and nutritional intervention.

For the final week of the trial, men wear an accelerometer to record the intensity of their physical activity.</p><p>We intend to recruit 100 men to the cohort, and of these, randomise at least 80 to the randomised controlled trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Evaluative interviews</title><p>Six months following randomisation, a random sample of men are interviewed to explore their experiences of the changes they were asked to make to their nutrition and physical activity, and their experience of participating in the research.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Withdrawal and discontinuation of participants</title><p>Men may be withdrawn from the study by their clinical care team or the research team if it is considered detrimental to continue, for example in light of disease progression. Men who fail to attend appointments are contacted via telephone to encourage them to attend, to arrange alternative appointments and to determine reasons for withdrawal.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Interventions</title><p>In the nutritional intervention, men are randomised to either a lycopene supplement intervention or a plant-based intervention or a nutritional control arm. The lycopene intervention involves one 10&#x000a0;mg lycopene capsule daily (provided to the man). The plant-based intervention comprises eating as many portions of fruit and vegetables daily as possible, aiming for at least five portions, and swapping dairy milk for non-dairy alternatives, for example, soya milk, as often as the men can. The control arm men carry on with their usual diet; if the men ask for nutritional advice, standard, publically available, information is provided.</p><p>In the physical activity intervention, men are randomised to either walking at a brisk pace for 30&#x000a0;minutes, on at least five days a week, on top of their usual physical activity or to continue with their usual levels of physical activity.</p><p>The men are provided with materials and detailed instructions specific to their allocated intervention arm by trained research nurses and asked to follow their allocated intervention arm for 6&#x000a0;months.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Primary outcome measures</title><p>Co-primary outcomes are randomisation rates (the proportion of eligible men who agree to be randomised) where a rate of 65&#x000a0;% or above would be considered acceptable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and adherence to the interventions at 6&#x000a0;months following randomisation, where a rate of 75&#x000a0;% or above would be considered acceptable. Adherence will be calculated for both the nutrition and physical activity interventions and is taken to be following intervention instructions&#x02009;&#x0003e;&#x02009;90&#x000a0;% of the time. Adherence to the nutrition intervention will be assessed by participant self-report on the daily monitoring form. This form is completed daily by the participants for the duration of the 6-month intervention. For the lycopene arm, men are asked if they took their supplement daily - yes/no; for vegetable and fruit consumption, men are asked how many portions they consumed daily; for dairy milk consumption, men are asked how much of their dairy milk they replaced with an alternative &#x02013; all/some/none. Adherence to the physical activity intervention will be assessed by their self-reported adherence to the recommended minimum 30&#x000a0;minutes of brisk walking five times per week during the 6-month intervention phase.</p><p>In order to assess the adherence rate with a confidence interval of&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;5&#x000a0;% and an estimated expected adherence rate of 75&#x000a0;%, the required minimum sample size for this feasibility study would be approximately 75 participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Incorporating an expected randomisation rate of 80&#x000a0;%, we intend to recruit at least 100 men into this study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Secondary outcome measures</title><p>The secondary outcomes include intervention tolerability (based on qualitative interviews and reported adverse events), retention (men successfully followed up at 6&#x000a0;months, as a proportion of those who were recruited to the trial and randomised into a study arm), change in PSA (a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland, which is often elevated in men with prostate cancer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>] and insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I) levels (raised IGF-I levels are increasingly being implicated as a potential risk factor for cancer) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>] and change in all other data collected between intervention groups at the different time points. We will explore whether biomarkers of lycopene for the lycopene intervention arm, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, lutein, lycopene, total carotenoids and vitamin C for fruit and vegetable intake, and phyto-oestrogen, as a biomarker for soya milk, are affected by the proposed interventions. Full details of the data being collected at specific time points are described in Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>. The study was not powered for secondary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Tissue collection</title><p>All samples are collected, used and stored in accordance with the Human Tissue Act 2004. Prostate tissue sections are formalin-fixed and tissue that is surplus to diagnostic requirements is stored for later analysis of nutritional and physical activity biomarkers (including epigenetic and metabolomic biomarkers) and surrogate biomarkers of prostate cancer (for example, expression levels of IGF-I). Stage, margin status and Gleason score for each radical prostatectomy specimen will be recorded. Collection of blood samples will allow biological mechanisms linking nutritional, physical activity and other lifestyle factors with prostate cancer risk and progression to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Theoretical underpinning</title><p>Three psychological theories will be employed during the PrEvENT trial, each serving a unique purpose. These are &#x02018;Teachable Moments&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>], the Transtheoretical Model of Change (Stages of Change) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>] and the Theory of Planned Behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>Data analysis will allow exploration of whether men with prostate cancer make naturally occurring changes to their diet and physical activity as a result of their cancer diagnosis and treatment. This will assist in establishing whether receiving a diagnosis of prostate cancer and undergoing treatment can be utilised as a &#x02018;Teachable Moment&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. It is hypothesised that prostate cancer diagnosis is a health event, or Teachable Moment, thought to motivate individuals to make changes to health or lifestyle behaviour.</p><p>The Transtheoretical Model of Change (Stages of Change) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>], assesses an individual&#x02019;s level of readiness to change. The model categorises people into a number of stages. Men in the trial will have their readiness to change assessed at the four data collection time points. Analysis will then establish whether men, at different levels of readiness to change, respond differently to the intervention. Additionally, it will be established whether the men&#x02019;s level of readiness to change alters during the trial.</p><p>The Theory of Planned Behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>] explores three key considerations which are proposed to influence whether an individual will make a behaviour change or not. These are behavioural beliefs, normative beliefs and control beliefs, which combine to influence intention to change behaviour. The PrEvENT trial participant-facing documents have been developed in a manner that intends to influence these three theoretical considerations, thus helping to implement the behaviour change in the men, and improve adherence and acceptability of the interventions.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Analysis plan</title><p>The primary comparative analyses will be by intention-to-treat. Baseline characteristics of each group will be tabulated using means and standard deviations for normally distributed data, medians and interquartile ranges for non-normally distributed data, and percentages and counts for categorical data. Randomisation rate and adherence to the intervention will both be reported as a percentage, along with the respective 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval.</p><p>We will also conduct exploratory analyses of change in physical activity and fruit and vegetable consumption (as measured for adherence to the interventions) will be analysed using a two-way ANOVAs or appropriate non-parametric tests if necessary. Change in selected secondary outcomes (IGF-I, PSA and blood biomarkers) will be analysed similarly, although this study is not powered for secondary outcomes. These analyses will focus on the main effects of the interventions, but we will also explore possible interactions between the interventions with respect to these outcomes. Assuming 80 men are recruited into the trial, this will provide approximately 90&#x000a0;% power to detect a large main effect size (f&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.4) with an alpha level of 0.05, analysing the study as a 2 x 3 factorial design (power will be reduced after correcting for multiple testing). We will also explore associations between baseline Stage of Change; behavioural, normative and control beliefs; and adherence to the interventions using chi-square tests and logistic regression models.</p><p>Qualitative data collected during this research will be analysed thematically using a qualitative method, such as the framework approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Individuals will not be identified by name in the written transcript. A qualitative analysis computer programme, such as NVivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>], will be used to assist analysis.</p><p>The SPIRIT 2013 checklist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>] and the CONSORT statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>] were followed and adhered to during the development of the trial protocol and implementation. The PrEvENT trial has been given full ethical approval by Cornwall and Plymouth Research Ethics Committee (REC), ref: 14/SW/0056, and registered on the ISRCTN registry, ref number ISRCTN99048944. All participants provide fully informed consent.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec20" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recruitment began in August 2014 (14&#x000a0;months previous to the time of manuscript submission), and to date, 69 men have been recruited. Initially, recruitment was intended to be complete within a 6-month period. However, this is now acknowledged to be an ambitious estimate. The initial recruitment approach, as described previously, was at the appointment where a decision about treatment is made, where eligible men would be invited into the research by the clinical staff during this appointment. Initial rates of recruitment were, however, slower than anticipated, with three men being recruited on average per month, primarily due to overburden of the clinical staff. Thus, a different approach to recruitment is now being taken. Eligible men are identified through a process of theatre list screening by the research nurse. Eligible men are contacted via a consultant-endorsed letter and then telephoned by the research nurse to be invited into the research. This method is proving to be fruitful, and recruitment rates have increased to eight men recruited on average per month. We now anticipate recruitment to be complete by January 2016. This is illustrated in Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>PrEvENT recruitment forecast</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1248_Fig2_HTML" id="MO2"/></fig></p><sec id="Sec21"><title>Summary</title><p>The PrEvENT RCT aims to determine whether men with localised prostate cancer, who are scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy, can be recruited into a pre-surgery cohort and subsequently randomised to a 6-month post-surgery diet and physical activity intervention trial.
