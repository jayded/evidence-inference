There was only a small decrease in effectiveness over time for individual and combined treatments. Those with more intense/disabling pain, higher distress and those who exhibited passive coping at baseline were more likely to have a positive outcome with tCBT than persons without these characteristics. tCBT was associated with the greatest increase in quality of life and lowest costs.

In an 11-year follow-up of 1555 patients with fibromyalgia in the USA, substantial or moderate symptom improvement was observed in only 10% and 15% patients, respectively, while in 39%, symptoms worsened.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> In a follow-up of 173 adults with CWP in the UK only 15% were pain-free 7&#x02005;years later.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></p><p>Although CWP symptoms are sometimes described as &#x02018;unexplained&#x02019;, epidemiological studies over the past two decades have provided important information on aetiology that has informed studies of management. Consistent findings in longitudinal population studies are that persons with poorer mental health (anxiety, depression and general psychological distress) and who take low levels of exercise have an increased risk of developing CWP or fibromyalgia.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> These risk factors offer targets for intervention: Bernardy <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> concluded that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) resulted in increased coping with pain, reduced depressed mood and healthcare seeking behaviour; Ha&#x000fc;ser <italic>et al</italic><xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> reported that an aerobic exercise programme resulted in decreased pain, and had positive effects on mood, health-related quality of life and physical fitness; and a network meta-analysis reported improved patient outcomes for both CBT and aerobic exercise.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, in a recent Cochrane review of CBT for fibromyalgia, the median duration of post-treatment follow-up for CBT interventions evaluated in trials was only 6&#x02005;months post-treatment.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></p><p>We have previously reported the short-term (3&#x02005;months post-treatment) results of the &#x02018;Managing Unexplained Symptoms (chronic widespread pain) In primary Care: Involving traditional and Accessible New approaches&#x02019; (MUSICIAN) trial.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> These demonstrated significant clinical benefits of an individual or combined 6-month programme of CBT delivered by telephone (tCBT) and an exercise programme, compared with usual care. However, cost-effectiveness of the active interventions was marginal at 3&#x02005;months post-treatment. In view of the positive clinical results we decided to conduct a long-term (24&#x02005;months post-treatment), unplanned, follow-up to determine whether clinical benefits persisted, and to assess longer term cost-effectiveness. We also aimed to determine whether the characteristics of participants at trial entry predicted treatment response.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><p>A 2&#x000d7;2 factorial randomised controlled trial was conducted during 2008&#x02013;2012. Trial participants, identified from the registered populations of eight general practices in Aberdeen, Scotland, and in Cheshire, England, were people aged &#x02265;25&#x02005;years who reported CWP according to the definition in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 1990 criteria for fibromyalgia,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> and for which they had consulted their general practitioner (GP) in the previous year. Exclusion criteria included contraindications to exercise, having pain that required specific alternative treatment or not having access to a landline telephone (for the delivery of CBT). Comorbid rheumatic disease was not an exclusion criterion. Participants were electronically randomised to treatment groups in blocks, stratified by pain intensity and disability (Chronic Pain Grade (CPG) questionnaire<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>) and psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire 12 item version (GHQ)<xref rid="R15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>) A full description of those randomised into the trial has been reported previously.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><sec id="s2a"><title>Treatment groups</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Telephone-delivered BCBT</title><p>This was delivered by therapists accredited by the British Association for Behaviour and Cognitive Psychotherapies who received 3&#x02005;days of trial-specific training, a therapist manual and fortnightly clinical supervision. All sessions were digitally recorded for use in therapist supervision<italic>.</italic> Therapists mailed brief details welcoming patients to the study, giving a brief introduction to CBT and providing contact details. The intervention included an initial assessment (45&#x02013;60&#x02005;min), seven weekly sessions (each 30&#x02013;45&#x02005;min) delivered over 6&#x02005;weeks, and a single session at 3 and 6&#x02005;months postrandomisation. Therapists conducted a patient-centred assessment, developed shared understanding and formulation of the participants&#x02019; problem(s), and identified two to three patient-defined goals. Patients received a self-management CBT manual, &#x02018;Managing Chronic Widespread Pain&#x02019;, developed for the study (available from the authors). To enable patients to make an informed choice of the form of CBT they preferred, the manual included stories of fictitious patients using specific CBT techniques: behavioural activation (structured increasing of activities), cognitive restructuring (identifying and evaluating unhelpful thinking styles) and lifestyle changes (managing sleep, fatigue, irritability). Sessions involved implementing CBT techniques, working toward goals and problem solving barriers to improvement, while later sessions focused on relapse prevention.</p></sec><sec id="s2a2"><title>Exercise</title><p>Experienced fitness instructors delivered the intervention and received a 1-day training session on exercise prescription for patients with CWP. They were observed during induction and follow-up meetings to monitor protocol adherence. Patients received a leisure-facility gym-based exercise programme consistent with American College of Sport Medicine (ACSM) guidelines for improving cardiorespiratory fitness.<xref rid="R16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> Following an induction session, patients were offered six fitness instructor-led monthly appointments for programme reassessment. Exercise intensity increased until levels were sufficient to achieve 40&#x02013;85% of heart rate reserve. The ACSM does not prescribe specific exercises; these are negotiated between fitness instructor and patient. The trial protocol reflected this, allowing exercises to be changed while maintaining the goal of improving cardiorespiratory fitness. The exercise intensity range was broad, allowing individuals with low fitness or those who were deconditioned to achieve goals with low-intensity exercise. To avoid musculoskeletal injuries and to promote compliance, initial intensity was low to moderate. Patients were free to engage in additional exercises (eg, strength and flexibility training) to those prescribed. The recommended session duration was 20&#x02013;60&#x02005;min. Patients completed a diary recording frequency of gym attendance, exercise duration and type of exercise, which was returned to the coordinating unit. The ACSM guidelines recommend an exercise frequency of 3&#x02013;5&#x02005;days per week. This was thought to be unrealistic. Instead, patients were advised to attend at least twice a week, and on non-gym days engage in &#x02018;everyday&#x02019; activities (eg, brisk walking) to enhance cardiorespiratory fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Combined treatment</title><p>Participants randomised to this group received both of the above treatments concurrently.</p></sec><sec id="s2a4"><title>Treatment as usual</title><p>Participants randomised to this group continued to receive usual care (without any restrictions) from their GP.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Outcome measurements</title><p>Primary and secondary outcome data were collected at the end of treatment, and at 3 and 24&#x02005;months post-treatment, by postal questionnaire. Non-responders were followed up with telephone interviews in which the primary outcome measure was recorded. The primary outcome measure was self-reported change in health status since the start of the trial; on a 7 point scale ranging from &#x02018;Very much worse&#x02019; through &#x02018;No change&#x02019; to &#x02018;Very much better&#x02019;.

Anticipated improvements in the four arms (taking account of likely effectiveness and compliance with intervention) were: treatment as usual (TAU) 10%, exercise only 20%, CBT only 21.3%, exercise and CBT 31.3%. A total of 552 persons were deemed necessary to have at least 80% power of detecting differences in the active intervention groups compared with TAU. However, due to higher than anticipated follow-up rates during the trial, and the fact that the trial steering committee and data monitoring committee considered the original estimates (which used a &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test with continuity correction) to be too stringent, the trial sample size was reduced to 468.</p><p>Main treatment effects were assessed on an intention-to-treat analysis. The primary outcome was analysed using generalised estimating equations (GEE) for longitudinal logistic regression. A 2-way factorial regression using the outcome at end of treatment, 3 and 24&#x02005;months post-treatment, including terms for treatment interaction and treatment&#x02013;time effect, was fitted. The term for the interaction of treatments was less than one (ie, the combined effects were less than multiplicative).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Analysis was carried out, therefore, comparing the three treatment groups to TAU. Secondary outcomes were analysed using GEE for longitudinal ordinal or linear regression where appropriate, including a treatment by time interaction with four separate treatment groups. Results are presented as ORs for logistic regression, proportional OR for ordinal regression and non-standardised regression coefficients for linear regression, with 95% CI for each active treatment compared with the TAU group at each time point, and for the treatment by time interaction. A Bonferroni correction allowed for multiple testing, with p values less than 0.004 considered statistically significant. Analyses were adjusted for age, sex, baseline CPG, baseline GHQ score and study centre, with analyses of secondary outcomes also adjusted for baseline scores on the outcome of interest. In order to determine the influence of missing follow-up data, we compared baseline data for participants who did and did not provide 24-month follow-up data. We also determined how sensitive the results were to missing follow-up data by, conservatively, assuming that all persons lost to follow-up data did not have a positive outcome on the primary measure, as well as performing analyses using imputation by chained equations, which predicts missing data based on all available data. All analyses were conducted using STATA software.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>To determine predictors of effectiveness of each intervention, logistic regression models were fitted separately for each outcome time point, to see which baseline factors (if any) modified treatment effectiveness. Age was treated as a continuous variable to calculate change in odds of treatment effectiveness for every 10&#x02005;years. Other predictors were split into two categories by the median value. Four treatment groups were specified and models included an interaction between the baseline characteristic of interest and the treatment. ORs were calculated to compare the odds of improvement in each active treatment group to TAU. Then, a separate longitudinal model was fitted for each of the predictors of treatment effectiveness, to assess whether the effect was the same over all follow-up time points. Adjustment was made for the same baseline characteristics as in the main analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Health economic analysis</title><p>The UK national tariff<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> was used to assign each participant with a health state utility weight based on their response to the EQ-5D at 24&#x02005;months post-treatment. Reported health service resource use during the previous 6&#x02005;months was valued using the same unit cost data used in the original analysis.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;29</xref> Additional quality adjusted life years (QALYs) accrued between 3 and 24&#x02005;months post-treatment were calculated for each participant assuming a linear change in utility. This was added to the 3-month post-treatment QALY estimate for each patient. Linear interpolation between reported health service costs at 3 and 24&#x02005;months post-treatment was used to impute an average quarterly cost for each patient for each of the five quarters not covered by data collection.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Costs and QALYs incurred beyond 12&#x02005;months were discounted at the rate of 3.5% per annum in line with accepted practice in the UK.</p><p>Multivariate regression analysis estimated differences in mean costs and QALYs between the three active treatment groups and TAU. A generalised linear model, with a &#x003b3; family distribution and a log link function, was specified to account for the skewed nature of the cost data. Cost-effectiveness acceptability curves were constructed using non-parametric bootstrapping and the net monetary benefit framework, to determine the probability of the alternative interventions being considered cost-effective at different ceiling ratios representing society's willingness to pay (WTP) per QALY (&#x000a3;20&#x02005;000&#x02013;&#x000a3;30&#x02005;000 per QALY are commonly applied ceiling ratios in the UK). The analysis was initially conducted for participants with complete cost and QALY data at final follow-up. Multiple imputation analyses, using chained equations, were used to assess the sensitivity of findings to missing data.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>In total, 884 people were identified as eligible and invited to participate in the trial, and 442 (50%) were randomised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="RMDOPEN2014000026F1">figure 1</xref>).

Combined treatment, however, did appear to produce greater improvements in several secondary outcome measures 24&#x02005;months post-treatment (compared to usual care and after correction for multiple testing). tCBT was highly cost-effective in the long-term, with the cost per QALY ranging between approximately &#x000a3;4k and &#x000a3;6k, depending on the method of analysis.</p><p>A number of points should be considered when interpreting our results. First, participants reported CWP (rather than having a diagnosis of fibromyalgia) and were recruited through primary care. Thus, many in the study population had symptoms that were less severe, as evidenced by the CPG and reported work status, than would typically be seen by rheumatologists. Second, it could be argued that the positive results were due to non-specific benefits from participating in a trial rather than the specific effects of the interventions delivered. Supporting such an interpretation is the similarity of positive effects across all active intervention groups (including the group receiving both interventions). Against this interpretation, CWP has proved very difficult for rheumatologists and others to treat, and so it seems unlikely that such strongly positive improvements resulted from simply &#x02018;attention&#x02019;. We also demonstrated improvements in some of the secondary outcomes related to participants&#x02019; perceptions of improvement in their condition. If our initial results were due to non-specific effects, we would expect such effects to wane with time. Instead, we have observed persistence of strong effects over 2&#x02005;years. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that persons more likely to benefit from tCBT have characteristics that tCBT seeks to change. We recognise, however, that not all patients with CWP will necessarily be willing to consider undertaking exercise or participating in a CBT programme. Our results, therefore, can only be extrapolated to those willing to do so and, in this study, 70% of persons randomised to tCBT completed at least six sessions while 50% of persons randomised to exercise attended the gym at least two times per week. Third, the study was not powered to undertake a robust analysis of those patients who might benefit most from each treatment. However, our strongly positive results for the primary outcome, and given the current interest in stratified medicine, provide an indication of those persons with CWP who may be most likely to benefit. This may be helpful given that CBT is not available everywhere in the UK or elsewhere. Finally, we did not restrict the usual care provided by the GP. However, no participant in the TAU arm reported receiving &#x02018;talking therapy&#x02019; or exercise therapy at follow-up. With no pharmacological therapies licensed in the UK for fibromyalgia (of which CWP is the cardinal feature), management is likely to have focused on advice, investigation and management of specific reported symptoms.</p><p>Reviews of CBT have been conducted in patients with fibromyalgia, however, their conclusions are not completely consistent. Cochrane reviews agree that CBT affects mood and pain positively.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>
<xref rid="R31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> While our study reported positive effects in the tCBT arm across all primary and secondary measures 2&#x02005;years after the end of treatment, with statistically significant improvements in passive coping, kinesiophobia, distress and SF-36 social function subscale (compared to TAU) at p&#x0003c;0.05, none met the more stringent statistical significance cut-off after correction for multiple testing. Most of the evidence to date on the effectiveness of exercise relates to fibromyalgia. Our study extends this evidence of benefit to persons with CWP and it provides evidence that the benefit is long-lasting. It has previously been shown that the effects of an exercise programme on psychological outcomes are maintained long after such a programme has finished and that long-term improvements in patients with fibromyalgia due to increased physical activity are maintained regardless of whether activity levels return to pretreatment levels after active treatment has finished.<xref rid="R32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref> It has been demonstrated in a recent meta-analysis that community-deliverable exercise programmes are effective for pain and physical function in adults with osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> In our study, the only statistically significant difference between exercise and TAU at 2&#x02005;years after treatment, other than in patient perception of change in their condition, was in the secondary measure SF-36 role emotional, an effect that did not persist after correction for multiple testing. Several guidelines on the management of fibromyalgia recommend the use of multimodal therapy.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>
<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> We therefore hypothesised that the benefits of receiving exercise and tCBT for CWP would be greater than either therapy alone. However, at each follow-up, the effects on the primary outcome measure of the combined therapy were very similar to each intervention delivered alone. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that, compared with TAU, the most statistically significant differences for secondary outcome measures occurred in the combined treatment group.</p><p>In summary, our study has demonstrated for the first time that a short course of either tCBT or exercise for persons with CWP can result in long-term improvements in patients&#x02019; global assessment of their condition, compared with TAU. There does not appear to be substantial advantage from providing both interventions. Our work has identified features of patients who may be more likely to respond to tCBT. Finally tCBT has been shown not only to be effective but also highly cost-effective. Future research should focus on: the mechanism by which these improvements might occur; identification of which patients are likely to derive most benefit from these types of non-pharmacological interventions; and investigate novel ways of delivery to further reduce the cost of provision.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors are grateful to the following practices and their patients for participating in the study: in Aberdeen: Carden Medical Centre, Elmbank Medical Practice, Great Western Medical Practice, Garthdee Medical Group, and in East Cheshire: Readesmoor Medical Group Practice, Lawton House Surgery, Bollington Medical Centre, Park Lane Surgery.
