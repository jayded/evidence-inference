The aim of the study was to assess the tolerance and safety of a formula containing an innovative mixture of oligosaccharides in early infancy.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>this study was performed as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial including healthy term infants. Infants were recruited before the age of 8 weeks, either having started with formula feeding or being fully breast-fed (breastfeeding group). Formula-fed infants were randomized to feeding with a regular formula containing a mixture of neutral oligosaccharides and pectin-derived acidic oligosaccharides (prebiotic formula group) or regular formula without oligosaccharides (control formula group). Growth, tolerance and adverse events were assessed at 8, 16, 24 and 52 weeks of age. The prebiotic and control groups showed similar mean weight, length and head circumference, skin fold thicknesses, arm circumference gains and stool frequency at each study point. As far as the anthropometric parameters are concerned, the prebiotic group and the control group did not attain the values shown by the breastfeeding group at any study point. The skin fold thicknesses assessed in the breastfeeding group at 8 weeks were strikingly larger than those in formula fed infants, whereas at 52 weeks were strikingly smaller. The stool consistency in the prebiotic group was softer than in the control group at 8, 16 and 24 weeks (p&#x0003c;0.001) and closer to that of the breastfeeding group. There was no difference in the incidence of adverse events between the two formula groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>our findings demonstrate the tolerability and the long term safety of a formula containing an innovative mixture of oligosaccharides in a large cohort of healthy infants.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration:</title><p>drks-neu.uniklinik-freiburg.de <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tinyurl.com/6nkku4p">DRKS 00000201</ext-link>

Indeed, they play a major role in generating a microbiota characterized predominantly by the presence of bifidobacteria and lactobacilli <xref rid="pone.0028010-Boehm2" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>. On the contrary, the microbiota of formula-fed infants compromises more Bacteroides, Staphylococci, Escherichia Coli and Clostridia <xref rid="pone.0028010-Harmsen1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. There is evidence that the development of bifidobacteria predominant microbiota may favour a decreased incidence of infections, allergies and gastrointestinal symptoms as seen in breast-fed infants compared with formula-fed infants <xref rid="pone.0028010-Field1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>. On the basis of the available data, for infants who are not breastfed, it seems reasonable to supplement infant formulas with oligosaccharides in order to develop intestinal microbiota similar to that of breastfed infants.</p><p>In human milk 80&#x02013;85&#x00025; of the oligosaccharides are neutral and 15&#x02013;20&#x00025; are acidic. A specific mixture of neutral oligosaccharides of non-milk origin has been developed to mimic the neutral oligosaccharides fraction of human milk, namely, short chain galacto-oligosaccharides which derived from enzymatic conversion of lactose and long chain fructo-oligosaccharides from chicory derived inulin <xref rid="pone.0028010-Boehm3" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. The human acidic-oligosaccharides composition is different from the composition of acidic-oligosaccharides used to supplement infant formula. The latter are derived from the enzymatic cleavage of citrus pectin acidic-oligosaccharides <xref rid="pone.0028010-Fanaro1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>. The combination of short chain galacto-oligosaccharides/long chain fructo-oligosaccharides with pectin acidic-oligosaccharides may favour the development of a bifidogenic microbiota, decrease the growth of pathogens in the intestine, have a positive effect on the mucus layer of the gastrointestinal tract, and may stimulate the maturation of the immune system <xref rid="pone.0028010-Fanaro1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028010-Lee1" ref-type="bibr">[9]</xref>.</p><p>To our knowledge there are no large and longitudinal trials on the gastrointestinal tolerance and long term safety of an infant formula supplemented with the mixture comprehensive of pectin acidic-oligosaccharides in addition to the well known neutral prebiotics (short chain galacto-oligosaccharides/long chain fructo-oligosaccharides <xref rid="pone.0028010-Braegger1" ref-type="bibr">[10]</xref>.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to evaluate the tolerance and safety of an infant formula supplemented with a mixture of short chain galacto-oligosaccharides, long chain fructo-oligosaccharides and pectin acidic-oligosaccharides, in healthy infants during the first year of life by investigating effects on growth, gastrointestinal tolerance and stool consistency and by identifying any adverse effects.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>The protocol of this trial and supporting CONSORT checklist are available as supporting information; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028010.s001">Checklist S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0028010.s002">Protocol S1</xref>.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Ethics Statement</title><p>Written informed consent was obtained from all parents before randomization.

The results of this study clearly demonstrated that this prebiotic mixture containing not only the neutral oligosaccharides (short chain galacto-oligosaccharides, long chain fructo-oligosaccharides) but also the acidic oligosaccharides pectin acidic-oligosaccharides was safe and well tolerated. These results supplement the recently published efficacy data on the incidence of fever episodes and the occurrence of atopic dermatitis in healthy term born infants during the first year of life <xref rid="pone.0028010-vanStuijvenberg1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028010-Grber1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.</p><p>In order to assess whether the prebiotic formula is tolerated and allows a growth as found in breastfed infants, we would have had to compare the formula groups with the breastfeeding group. However, it is impossible to randomize infants to either breastfeeding or a formula. As a result, groups are not comparable and therefore we made no statistical comparisons.</p><p>The infants that received the supplemented formula showed no significant changes in z-scores for weight, length and head circumference values during the first year of life and in the rate of weight gain until the age of four months as compared to the infants fed the control formula. Furthermore, all infants exhibited linear, ponderal and head circumference growth rates within the normal range as compared with the standardized European growth references <xref rid="pone.0028010-World1" ref-type="bibr">[11]</xref>.</p><p>In order to exclude the possibility that the absence of any significant variation in the rate of weight gain could be due to an inadequate sample size, we performed a power calculation to detect a difference in weight gain of 3 g/day over a 3 to 4 month period, which is considered to be nutritionally significant <xref rid="pone.0028010-US1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, for prebiotics group versus control group in the intention-to-treat population, which was 87&#x00025; (assessed by a two-sided t-test using an alpha of 5&#x00025;).</p><p>As far as the breastfed infants are concerned, we found higher rates of growth increments in the first six months of life than the formula fed subjects. This finding is in agreement with results from previous studies where breastfed infants presented higher growth rate during the first months of life compared with formula-fed infants <xref rid="pone.0028010-Agostoni1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028010-WHO1" ref-type="bibr">[18]</xref>.</p><p>Our results are consistent with the observation that infants fed formula supplemented with different combinations of prebiotics achieve a growth within the normal range <xref rid="pone.0028010-Fanaro1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028010-Moro1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028010-Ziegler1" ref-type="bibr">[20]</xref>.</p><p>The effect of acidic-oligosaccharides and galacto-oligosaccharides/fructo-oligosaccharides/acidic-oligosaccharides on safety as well as tolerance was previously investigated only by Fanaro et al <xref rid="pone.0028010-Fanaro1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> by means of an explorative study. The authors reported that there was no difference in growth and gastrointestinal tolerance between groups. Our data confirm the results of this study conducted in a small sample of infants (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;46) for a relatively short period of six weeks.</p><p>With regard to gastrointestinal tolerance, the occurrence of gastrointestinal symptoms was throughout the study similar in the prebiotics group and control group. In agreement with our findings, previous studies have reported that prebiotic supplementation does not affect gastrointestinal symptoms except stool consistency <xref rid="pone.0028010-Moro1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028010-Rao1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref>. In our study stool consistency scores in infants fed formula supplemented with the prebiotic mixture were significantly lower than those in the control group at 8, 16, 24 weeks, and closer to those presented by breastfed infants. As seen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pone-0028010-t004">table 4</xref> the lower stool consistency score in the prebiotics group compared to the control group was based on a higher number of loose and soft stools and a smaller number of formed and hard stools. This latter finding is clinically relevant, as in daily practice mothers of formula-fed infants frequently complain about high stool consistency which may cause discomfort. In addition, several studies have demonstrated that formula supplemented with prebiotics promotes the development of a stool consistency similar to those of breastfed infants <xref rid="pone.0028010-Moro1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0028010-Boehm4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>.

Although previous studies have demonstrated that short chain galacto-oligosaccharides/long chain fructo-oligosaccharides (9&#x02236;1) determine a slight increase in stool frequency <xref rid="pone.0028010-Moro1" ref-type="bibr">[19]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0028010-Boehm4" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>, the tendency for increased stool frequency reported in infants fed prebiotics may not be of clinical relevance as these frequencies are in the normal range for healthy infants.</p><p>Drop-out rates, reasons for dropping out and the incidence of serious adverse events were similar in both the prebiotics group and control group demonstrating that the prebiotic formula was safe and well tolerated<monospace>.</monospace>
