Because endoscopic removal of the capsule with the help of endoscopic foreign body retrieval devices and polypectomy forceps was unsuccessful in the first case, a new capsule was attached next to the other 1 in these 4 cats. No problems were encountered with this approach. Passing of pH capsules through the digestive tract was verified by daily fecal examination in all cats. A total of 2,909&#x000a0;hours and 20&#x000a0;minutes of intragastric pH recording time (equivalent to 1,745,580 pH readings) was obtained. The maximum possible data acquisition was 3,072&#x000a0;hours (96&#x000a0;hours per cat per treatment). Therefore, the overall missing data rate was 5.3%. Missing data were caused by signal interference in the radiotelemetric system, which occurred intermittently in all treatment groups.</p><fig fig-type="Figure" xml:lang="en" id="jvim12580-fig-0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>View of the Bravo<sup>&#x02122;</sup> capsule attached to the feline gastric mucosa.

<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim12580-note-0002">2</xref> the goal of the present study was to compare the effects of PO administered gastric acid suppressants commonly used in cats. Our study clearly demonstrated that twice&#x02010;daily omeprazole administration provided superior gastric acid suppression compared with a once&#x02010;daily dosage regimen and with standard dosages of ranitidine and placebo based on percentage of time intragastric pH was &#x02265;3 and &#x02265;4. The conceptual basis for these cut&#x02010;offs has been explored by meta&#x02010;analysis of many trials in human medicine, and these cut&#x02010;offs are now considered ideal for promoting optimal gastrointestinal ulcer healing.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0016" ref-type="ref">16</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> Comparison of once&#x02010;daily and twice&#x02010;daily omeprazole administration was chosen because additional drug administration could pose a substantial problem for sick cats and would likely result in poor owner compliance. A twice&#x02010;daily dosage regimen used in small animals has been largely extrapolated from studies of humans.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> A simplified omeprazole suspension (enteric&#x02010;coated granules suspended in 8.4% sodium bicarbonate) administered to dogs as a bolus through a stomach tube resulted in superior gastric acid suppression over 24&#x000a0;hours compared with once&#x02010;daily omeprazole.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Another study in dogs found that the effect of once&#x02010;daily administration of reformulated omeprazole paste used in horses for gastric acid secretion waned substantially during 24&#x000a0;hours after administration.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref> It therefore was postulated that a twice&#x02010;daily dosage regimen was more beneficial. It was surprising that the once&#x02010;daily dosage of omeprazole in the present study had poor results in cats because comparable omeprazole dosages in dogs yielded a mean percentage of time with intragastric pH &#x02265;3 of 70.2% and &#x02265;4 of 52.3%.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> Species&#x02010;specific differences such as increased <italic>de novo</italic> biosynthesis of proton pumps may account for this difference because restoration of acid secretion is dependent on pump biosynthesis.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0018" ref-type="ref">18</xref> Delayed gastric release of omeprazole from the gelatin capsule with inadequate intestinal absorption caused by variability in the hardness of the capsule wall<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim12580-note-0009">9</xref> was ruled out as a cause of the unexpected low intragastric pH because the capsules were shown to dissolve quickly at all pH levels.</p><p>The effects of ranitidine and placebo on intragastric pH did not differ in the present study, which is in contrast to a recent report that PO administered famotidine in cats had better antisecretory efficacy than placebo.<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim12580-note-0002">2</xref> Ranitidine and famotidine were shown to have poor antisecretory properties in dogs.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0004" ref-type="ref">4</xref>, <xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0005" ref-type="ref">5</xref> We anticipated similar results, based on observations that plasma gastrin concentrations did not increase in cats undergoing long&#x02010;term ranitidine treatment.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> This indicates that ranitidine has weak antisecretory properties because gastrin release is inhibited by the presence of acid in the stomach by a negative feedback mechanism.

</p><p>To facilitate swallowing of the capsule, a teaspoon of highly palatable canned feline food<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim12580-note-0006">6</xref> was fed immediately after pill administration. Administration of water by syringe usually is recommended after oral drug administration in cats.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0022" ref-type="ref">22</xref> However, the cats in our study did not tolerate syringe feeding of water, but readily ate the small amount of food<xref ref-type="fn" rid="jvim12580-note-0006">6</xref>. This procedure is likely more practical for owners who administer drugs to their cats at home, and we do not believe that the small amount of food compromised the efficacy of the medication.

Considering the strong and long&#x02010;lasting attachment of the capsule to the gastric mucosa in cats when using a vacuum time &#x0003e;25&#x000a0;seconds, it should be possible to study the efficacy of gastric acid suppressants for longer than 4&#x000a0;days.</p><p>We saw considerable individual variation in response to treatment with omeprazole and much less so with ranitidine. For example, 1 cat consistently had close to 100% acid suppression (e.g. percentage of time pH was &#x02265;4 was 95% when treated with twice&#x02010;daily omeprazole), whereas another had extremely poor acid suppression (percentage of time pH was &#x02265;4 was 3% when treated with twice&#x02010;daily omeprazole).

</p><p>The washout periods used in the present study varied slightly among treatments subject to staff availability. However, we feel that the protocols used in our experiments precluded drug carryover effects. The minimum washout period of 7&#x000a0;days (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;5) pertained to 3 examinations preceded by placebo and 2 preceded by ranitidine. The next shortest washout period was 9&#x000a0;days (n&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;2), pertaining to 2 examinations preceded by once&#x02010;daily omeprazole. A minimum of 1&#x000a0;week washout period was chosen because full restoration of gastric acid secretion was shown 7&#x000a0;days after long&#x02010;term administration of ranitidine in cats<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0009" ref-type="ref">9</xref> and 5&#x000a0;days after long&#x02010;term administration of omeprazole in people.<xref rid="jvim12580-bib-0034" ref-type="ref">34</xref>
</p><p>In conclusion, twice&#x02010;daily administration of omeprazole granules appears to be the treatment of choice for cats with acid&#x02010;related gastrointestinal disease.
