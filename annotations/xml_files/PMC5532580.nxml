This secondary analysis explored the effects of past sexual (SA) and physical (PA) assault on depression, alcohol misuse, global functioning and attrition in the Depression and Alcohol Integrated and Single focussed Intervention (DAISI) project, whose participants (N = 278) received cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) for their depression and/or alcohol misuse. Of the 278 DAISI participants, 220 consented to screening for past assault (either by a stranger or non-stranger) at baseline. Depression, alcohol, and global functioning assessments were administered at baseline and 3, 12, 24, and 36 months post baseline. A between-group analysis was used to assess differences between SA and No SA, and PA and No PA groupings, on adjusted mean treatment outcomes across all assessment periods. SA and PA participants had similar mean symptom reductions compared to No SA and No PA participants except for lower depression and global functioning change scores at the 12-month follow-up. People with coexisting depression and alcohol misuse reporting SA or PA can respond well to CBT for depression and alcohol misuse. However, follow-up is recommended in order to monitor fluctuations in outcomes.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>violence</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>alcohol drinking</kwd><kwd>cognitive behaviour therapy</kwd><kwd>treatment</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1-jcm-06-00072"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Assault exposure across the lifetime is often reported in mental health [<xref rid="B1-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and substance/alcohol misuse populations [<xref rid="B2-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Victim of crime rates (including physical (PA) and sexual assaults (SA)) in mental health populations are 11 times higher than the general community, especially for those with a severe mental illness [<xref rid="B4-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Rates of assault (across the life time) are also high in substance misuse populations [<xref rid="B5-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] with 90% reporting exposure to multiple traumas [<xref rid="B3-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B7-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Research has also found that people who report exposure to intentional traumas (such as sexual and physical assault) are also more likely to experience comorbid posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), alcohol misuse, and depression, compared to those who experience non-intentional traumas [<xref rid="B8-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. High rates of PTSS, alcohol misuse, and depression are also reported in people who experienced childhood abuse [<xref rid="B2-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B11-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>Studies investigating treatment outcomes following an assault have found posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)-focused Cognitive Behaviour Therapies (CBT) effective in reducing assault-related PTSS [<xref rid="B12-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and depressive symptoms [<xref rid="B14-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B15-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. The PTSD-focused CBT model has also been found effective in treating PTSD that coexists in substance/alcohol misuse populations [<xref rid="B12-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B15-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B17-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, most PTSD-CBT studies are limited in that they predominantly recruit female participants [<xref rid="B14-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B19-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="B20-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] while other studies show that relapse rates are higher in participants with coexisting PTSD and alcohol misuse [<xref rid="B5-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B21-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Furthermore, studies on treatment outcomes in participants with coexisting history of exposure to intentional traumas (such as interpersonal violence) and alcohol misuse, tend to have much poorer symptom improvement compared to those without these experiences [<xref rid="B5-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Despite established high prevalence rates of assault across the lifetime in mental health populations [<xref rid="B22-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and in coexisting depressed and alcohol misuse populations [<xref rid="B6-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B23-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], screening for traumatic events tends not to occur in health services [<xref rid="B22-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. If exposure to traumatic events is not assessed in health settings, then the CBT treatments that are provided may not include the necessary PTSD-focused interventions. When trauma symptoms are not addressed (i.e., where participants receive non-PTSD focused CBT), those with comorbid depression [<xref rid="B24-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] or alcohol misuse [<xref rid="B25-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] have poorer treatment outcomes and higher recidivism rates compared to those without trauma symptoms.</p><p>This study is a secondary analysis of the Depression and Alcohol Integrated and Single focused Intervention (DAISI) project (parent study) [<xref rid="B26-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], whereby we investigated how lifetime SA and/or PA effects treatment outcomes of people seeking depression and alcohol CBT. At the time of writing, no research into the effects of receiving non-PTSD focused CBT for coexisting depression and alcohol misuse in this treatment seeking population, who have also experienced traumatic assault (by a stranger and/or non-stranger) could be identified. Also unknown is how different assault types affect depression and alcohol treatment outcomes. Therefore, we aimed to explore the effects of past exposure to SA and PA on comorbid depression and alcohol misuse; and other outcomes along with rates of attrition, following CBT treatment for coexisting depression and alcohol misuse.</p><p>We predicted that participants who reported past SA or PA would show poorer treatment outcomes across follow-up, including more severe depressive symptoms, alcohol misuse (greater alcohol consumption and more severe dependence symptoms), and poorer global functioning compared to those without assault exposure. We also predicted that participants who reported past SA or PA would show poorer attendance during the treatment and follow-up assessments compared with those without assault exposure.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-jcm-06-00072"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2dot1-jcm-06-00072"><title>2.1. The Parent Study</title><p>The parent study was the DAISI project, which was a randomised controlled trial in Newcastle and Brisbane, Australia [<xref rid="B26-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. The DAISI project recruited participants seeking treatment for depression and alcohol misuse. Participants were randomly allocated to an initial single-session integrated intervention, or to one of three CBT interventions of nine additional sessions focusing on alcohol only, depression only, or alcohol and depression. The DAISI trial found that: longer interventions tended to be more effective in improving depression and functioning in the long term, and in reducing alcohol consumption in the short term. Integrated treatment was at least as effective as single-focused CBT. Alcohol-focused treatment was as effective as depression-focused treatment in reducing depression and more effective in reducing alcohol consumption. The best approach appeared to be an initial focus on both conditions (as per the initial session) followed by additional integrated- or alcohol-focused sessions [<xref rid="B26-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="B27-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot2-jcm-06-00072" sec-type="subjects"><title>2.2.

The inclusion criteria for the DAISI project were: (a) &#x02265;16 years of age; (b) current depressive symptoms; (c) and consuming alcohol at harmful levels as determined by 2001 National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) drinking guidelines [<xref rid="B28-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Potential participants were excluded if they: (i) were currently diagnosed with a psychotic disorder; (ii) reported traumatic brain injury; (iii) lacked fluency in English; or (iv) lived too far away to attend sessions. Participants may have also concurrently received treatment for depression or alcohol misuse from other services.</p></sec><sec id="sec2dot3-jcm-06-00072"><title>2.3. Measures</title><p>Traumatic assault and PTSS were measured using the Posttraumatic Stress Diagnostic Scale (PDS) [<xref rid="B29-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. An assault was considered traumatic if the participant felt helpless or hopeless (Criterion A) during exposure [<xref rid="B30-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. PTSS severity was measured by summing questions 22&#x02013;38 which were ranked from &#x0201c;5 or more times a week&#x0201d; (3), &#x0201c;2 to 4 times a week&#x0201d; (2), &#x0201c;once a week or less&#x0201d; (1), and &#x0201c;not at all or only once&#x0201d; (0). The score for PTSS severity ranges between 0 and 51 [<xref rid="B29-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. The PDS trauma checklist groups SA events into 3 event types: SA by a stranger; a non-stranger; or when under 18 by someone 5 years older than them. PA events types are grouped into PA by a stranger or a non-stranger [<xref rid="B29-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Depressive symptoms for the 2 weeks before baseline were measured using the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) [<xref rid="B31-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Participants rated the severity of 21 symptoms of depression from 0 to 3, where 3 indicates highest severity. Questions 16 and 18 have seven options around changes in appetite and sleep. BDI scores range from 0 to 63 [<xref rid="B31-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p><p>Alcohol misuse across the previous 6 months was measured with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) [<xref rid="B32-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. The AUDIT has 10 items with a score range between 0 and 36 with questions 1&#x02013;3 assessing for levels of alcohol consumption, questions 4&#x02013;6 assessing alcohol dependence symptoms, and questions 7&#x02013;10 assessing for harms associated with alcohol use [<xref rid="B32-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p><p>Symptoms of alcohol dependence within the 6-month period before baseline were assessed by the Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire (SADQ-C) [<xref rid="B32-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].

Activity lists and scheduling were developed and mindfulness tasks commenced. Sessions 5&#x02013;7 focused on identifying and managing unhelpful automatic thoughts, improving problem solving, and examining evidence for problematic schema and core beliefs. Sessions 8&#x02013;10 were based on developing an emergency plan, practicing assertiveness or alcohol refusal skills, and relapse prevention techniques [<xref rid="B35-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>].

Statistical Analysis</title><p>Due to the limited sample size, the analysis focused on the assault groupings of SA (non-stranger, stranger, and sexual contact &#x0003c;18 years) versus No SA, and PA (physical assault by a stranger and/or non-stranger) versus No PA.</p><p>Chi-square (&#x003c7;<sup>2</sup>) tests of independence were performed on SA versus No SA group membership versus treatment allocation, gender, and current prescription of antidepressant medication. We conducted <italic>t</italic>-tests on SA versus No SA, and PA versus No PA at baseline for treatment attendance, days in treatment, PTSS, depression, alcohol consumption/misuse/dependence, and global functioning. To explore attrition, we used discrete-time survival analysis to obtain hazard ratios for SA versus No SA, and PA versus No PA, over the five follow-up periods. Participant characteristics were reported in percentages, means, and standard deviations.</p><p>Group effects for SA versus No SA, and PA versus No PA at the 3, 12, 24, and 36-month post-baseline assessments were assessed via linear mixed-effects regression on mean changes in symptom levels for the following treatment outcome variables: PTSS severity, depressive symptom; levels of alcohol consumption, severity of alcohol problems; severity of alcohol dependence symptoms; and global functioning. The analyses were adjusted for baseline symptoms, gender, antidepressant medication, and days in treatment. Analyses using the above treatment outcome variables were based on the intention-to-treat principle, whereby all participants are included in the analysis, regardless of treatment retention/attrition [<xref rid="B36-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>In supplementary analyses, we assessed (via linear mixed-effects regressions) the interaction effects of follow-up periods by SA status by PA status (and all lower order interactions) on the estimated mean changes from baseline in symptom levels.

Discussion</title><p>This study found that participants with a history of SA or <italic>PA</italic> reported more severe depression, alcohol misuse, and poorer levels of global functioning at baseline, compared with those with no assault exposure. Although participants reporting past assaults responded well to our non-PTSD focused CBT at posttreatment, they had poorer symptom outcomes at the 12-month follow-up period. These findings have important clinical implications in the delivery of psychological therapy for coexisting depression and alcohol misuse among people with a history of SA or PA. One such clinical implication is the screening for assaults in depressed and alcohol misuse treatment seekers due to the initial severity of symptoms and possible deterioration by the 12-month follow-up.</p><p>The first hypothesis predicted that participants reporting past SA or PA would exhibit poorer attendance at treatment and follow-up. Whilst the SA group attended (on average) the same number of treatment sessions as the No SA group, the PA group attended fewer treatment sessions than the No PA group. Lower attendance rates were particularly reported by those with two or more PA event types (two sessions compared to five attended by the SA, No SA, and No PA groups). This suggests that participants with PA experiences may be more difficult to retain in treatment compared with those who experience SA.</p><p>We found negligible evidence for the second hypothesis that participants reporting assault exposure would have poorer treatment outcomes compared with participants with no assault exposure. Both SA and PA groups showed similar levels of symptom improvement over time, compared with those who were in the No SA and No PA groups. The only area of comparatively poorer functioning for the <italic>SA</italic> group was for global functioning at the 12-month follow-up period. PA participants were also more likely to experience poorer symptom outcomes at 12-months for global functioning and alcohol dependence symptoms. The supplementary analysis, however, found that SA and PA only participants had significantly more severe depressive symptoms and lower global functioning scores at the 12-month follow-up. This finding is different to the primary analysis that found the PA group had more severe alcohol dependence symptoms at the 12-month follow-up, which may be due to the smaller sample size in the supplementary analysis grouping. Overall, these results show that aftercare is required for both SA and PA to help maintain symptom improvement over time.</p><p>The similar rates of treatment success for the SA group (versus No SA) may be due to these participants being predominantly female. Research has found that compared with males, females are more likely to respond well to treatment [<xref rid="B38-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. This gender pattern has also been found to occur for CBT interventions in substance using populations [<xref rid="B39-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. Other studies have also found that sexually assaulted females respond well to integrated CBT for depression [<xref rid="B40-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>,<xref rid="B41-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>].</p><p>The comparatively poor symptoms for the PA (versus No PA) group in global functioning and severity of alcohol dependence symptoms at the 12-month follow-up may have been influenced by treatment and session participation, as this group spent significantly fewer days in treatment. Poorer comorbid symptom outcome for the PA (versus No PA) group may also have been influenced by participants (who reported two or more PA event types) not taking antidepressant medication. The poorer outcomes for the PA (versus No PA) group at the 12-month assessment suggests that the <italic>PA</italic> participants may require additional (or booster) treatment sessions 12 months post-treatment to maintain symptom improvements.</p><p>The maintained improvement in most of the treatment outcome variables over most of the follow-up periods may have also been the result of the CBT model being the basis of the DAISI interventions. High quality CBT programs have been found to have greater effects for participants at high risk of relapse [<xref rid="B42-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. CBT may also be better suited for longer-term outcomes [<xref rid="B39-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>,<xref rid="B43-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] as the skills that are taught appear to be retained after treatment [<xref rid="B44-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>].</p><p>The main limitation of this study was that the parent study recruited participants with depressive symptoms and alcohol misuse rather than an assault exposure population, affecting assault allocation and obtaining further information about assault history. This recruitment limitation also resulted in limited power to determine if there were any between-group differences for SA versus No SA and PA versus No PA by the four treatment conditions. Also, the long-term effects of treatment on PTSS could not be determined as the parent study did not measure this variable beyond 3 months. We would suggest caution with interpreting our results due to the number of tests conducted. Even though these issues raised are research limitations, these findings may be reflective of what occurs in mental health, and alcohol and other drug treatment services, whereby patients often present for treatment of other symptoms (as per DAISI project) [<xref rid="B6-jcm-06-00072" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="sec5-jcm-06-00072"><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>This study showed that people who have coexisting depressive symptoms and alcohol misuse, and who have been assaulted, can respond well to non-PTSD focused CBT, and that improvement is maintained over time. However, people who report PA may be more difficult to retain in treatment compared with those who have not experienced PA. Furthermore, people who have been assaulted may also experience more severe symptoms and comparatively poorer global functioning 12 months post treatment. Therefore, it may be beneficial for health care workers to screen for traumatic events, monitor outcomes over time, and offer booster sessions to comorbid populations who experienced assaults.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors would also like to acknowledge the assistance of Jane McDonald with template customising.
