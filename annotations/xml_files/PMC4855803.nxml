Around 80&#x000a0;% of clavicle fractures occur in the middle third of the clavicle. Randomised controlled trials comparing treatment interventions have failed to indicate the best therapeutic practices for these fractures. The objective of this study is to evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of two commonly-used conservative interventions: the figure-of-eight bandage versus the arm sling as treatments of middle-third clavicle fractures.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p>This project has been designed as a single-centre, two-arm randomised controlled trial that will compare two interventions: figure-of-eight bandage versus the arm sling. We propose to recruit 110 adults, aged 18&#x000a0;years or older, with an acute (less than 10&#x000a0;days since injury) middle-third clavicle fracture. The primary outcomes to be evaluated will be function and/or disability measured by the Disability of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (DASH) questionnaire. In order to assess the secondary outcomes, the Modified University of California at Los Angeles (modified &#x02013; UCLA) Shoulder Rating Scale will be used. The occurrence of pain (Visual Analogue Scale for pain (VAS)), treatment failure, adverse events and the ability to return to previous activities will also be recorded and evaluated as secondary outcomes. Data analysis<italic>:</italic> the primary outcome DASH score and the secondary outcomes &#x02013; modified UCLA and VAS scores &#x02013; will be analysed graphically.

The incidence is bimodal with peak incidence in youth and in later life with a male excess in the young and a female excess (7:1) in later life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. The most common site of fracture is the middle third of the clavicle, representing approximately 80&#x000a0;% of all clavicle fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p>Traditionally, middle-third clavicle fractures have been treated conservatively, even when substantially displaced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A large number of methods to immobilise the region have been described. However, the most common methods are the use of a figure-of-eight strap (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1a</xref>), an arm sling (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1b</xref>), or a combination of the two [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Indications for surgery include open fractures, severe displacement caused by comminution, suspicion of imminent skin lesion production by a sharp clavicle fracture edge, or neurovascular injuries. Relative indications for surgery include polytrauma, floating shoulder, painful malunion and painful nonunion. More recently though, the scope of indications has widened to include high-energy fractures, such as clavicle shortening of greater than 20&#x000a0;mm, complete displacement and severe comminution. There are several fixation techniques that can be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. The most frequently used is internal fixation with plates or wires. Bone grafting may also be used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Conservative management to clavicle fractures: <bold>a</bold> Figure-of-eight bandage. <bold>b</bold> Simple arm sling</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2016_1355_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p><p>In contrast to fractures at other skeletal sites, there are only few randomised trials which have compared either conservative or surgical approaches to the management of clavicle fracture. In addition, the available evidence from isolated trials is limited regarding the effectiveness of the different methods of surgical and conservative interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Lenza et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>] concluded that evidence of only two clinical trials published in the 1980s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] is insufficient to determine the effects (benefits and harms) of the different methods of conservative (non-operative) treatments for acute (treated soon after diagnosis) middle-third clavicle fractures in adults. A search strategy, updated in January 2014, did not find any new comparative studies on conservative interventions for treating clavicle fractures.</p><p>Current literature reinforces the view that the best conservative treatment for middle-third clavicle fractures in adults is controversial. A recent survey indicates that most US surgeons prefer to use a simple sling rather than the figure-of-eight bandage for conservatively treating their patients (94&#x000a0;% prefer the simple sling versus 6&#x000a0;% prefer the figure-of-eight bandage) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. In contrast, a survey on conservative treatment of clavicle fractures in Germany concluded that the simple clavicle fractures are treated in a nonsurgical way and orthopaedic surgeons prefer the use of the figure-of-eight bandage in 88&#x000a0;% of cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>Therefore, there is a need to investigate which would be the best intervention (considering functional endpoints and adverse effects) in patients with clavicle fractures. Since nonsurgical treatments are the most prevalent in current clinical practice, the authors of this study chose to evaluate the effects (benefits and harms) of conservative interventions: the figure-of-eight bandage versus the arm sling, for treating middle-third clavicle fractures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods/design</title><p>This project has been designed as a single-centre, two-arm (parallel) randomised controlled trial with follow-up at 12&#x000a0;months, following the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) Statement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>] (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref> shows the participant flow diagram).

Allowing for approximately 10&#x000a0;% loss to follow-up at 12&#x000a0;months, we aim to recruit a total of 110 patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Demographic and baseline data will be summarised in the two study groups presenting number in each category and percentages of the number of patients in each group for categorical variables and presenting means and standard deviations or medians and quartiles for continuous variables. If we observe some clinically important imbalance between groups regarding to baseline variables we will adjust for them in the main analysis.</p><p>Patients, who for any reason may require additional interventions as part of their treatment, will be followed up, and their results will be included in the group into which they had initially been randomised, according to the intention-to-treat principle.</p><p>The primary outcome (DASH score) and the secondary outcomes (modified UCLA and VAS scores) will be analysed graphically. We will apply generalised mixed models in the intervention groups (two levels) and time-point assessments (seven levels) as fixed effects. To evaluate the effect of surgical interventions required due to treatment failure in the DASH score a similar model will be adjusted including the effect of surgery (two levels). In this analysis, patients who are undergoing surgery will have the data analysed up to the last assessment before surgery.</p><p>Secondary outcomes: treatment failure, adverse events and return to activities will be analysed individually by the chi-square test. The time to return to previous activities will be analysed by a Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox proportional hazard regression. The total analgesic amount consumed by the patients during the follow-up will be analysed by comparing study groups using the Mann-Whitney test.</p><p>To handle the effects of missing data we will describe patterns of missingness in the study groups and use the model-based method of multiple imputation to replace missing data.</p><p>The significance level of 5&#x000a0;% will be adopted in the analysis of the primary outcome and 1&#x000a0;% in the secondary outcomes, to avoid chance of statistical significance due to multiple tests.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Discussion</title><p>This protocol describes a pragmatic trial design, which has been chosen because of its direct applicability to clinical practice. Thus, this study includes design characteristics known to minimise bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. Participants will be assigned using a concealed random procedure, assessments and data analysis will be blinded and we will use the intention-to-treat analysis. Consequently, our inclusion criteria will reflect the variety of patient presentations that would be encountered by general orthopaedic surgeons in the clinical setting. In addition, our primary outcome is a validated Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for the shoulder.</p><p>Currently, acute displaced middle-third clavicle fractures are conventionally treated by conservative interventions with high expectation of fracture union and patient satisfaction. However, a recent multicentre randomised controlled trial demonstrated better functional outcomes with surgical interventions, but the authors did not support routine primary surgical treatment for these fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>].</p><p>A small randomised controlled trial was recently published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]; it included 60 participants with an acute, isolated middle-third clavicle fracture. The authors compared the broad arm sling with the figure-of-eight bandage; their outcome measures were pain, Constant and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores and degree of radiographic union. The study concluded that both techniques provided acceptable functional and radiological outcomes for treating clavicle fractures. However, the broad arm sling was significantly more comfortable in the first 3&#x000a0;days of treatment. One weakness of that study was the small sample size and the additional loss of patients in the final follow-up period (two patients in the broad arm sling group and seven patients in the figure-of-eight bandage group), which may have affected the results, since the sampling loss was greater in the figure-of-eight bandage group. The study had other sources of bias. First, the study design did not permit blinding of participants, orthopaedic surgeons and outcome assessors; although failure of blinding can have a serious effect on study outcomes, the authors were unable to perform it. Secondly, the function outcomes (Constant and American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons scores) were not validated for use in a number of settings (mainly Constant score) and these scores may not be specific for use as an outcome in clavicle fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>According to current evidence from a systematic review, there is very limited evidence from two single trials regarding the effectiveness of different methods of conservative interventions for treating clavicle fractures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. The reported results in the literature regarding the outcome of conservative treatment of middle-third clavicle fractures are controversial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>]. In addition, as a conclusion of the most updated Cochrane systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], randomised controlled trials comparing contemporary conservative interventions, such as an arm sling versus the figure-of-eight bandage, for clavicle fractures are warranted. Consequently, we expect that our present study will provide conclusive results that can be readily used in clinical practice and offer evidence-based approaches for the conservative treatment of middle-third clavicle fractures.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Trial status</title><p>This trial started recruiting patients in November 2015.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec18"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="13063_2016_1355_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Informed consent (Portuguese).
