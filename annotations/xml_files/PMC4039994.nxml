In Europe, a study, which was a part of the <italic>DRiving Under the Influence of Drugs, alcohol and medicines (DRUID)</italic> project, reported an estimated prevalence of alcohol use of 3.48&#x000a0;%, illicit drug use of 1.90&#x000a0;%, impairing medicinal drug use of 1.36&#x000a0;%, and drug-drug combination of 0.39&#x000a0;% in the general population of drivers (Houwing et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">2011</xref>). A roadside survey in the USA indicated that illicit drugs are used by 5.8&#x000a0;%, medicinal drugs by 4.8&#x000a0;%, and a drug-drug combination by 0.5&#x000a0;% of weekend drivers (Lacey et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">2009</xref>). Because of the large number of people involved and the severity of the consequences, one of the most important risks of medicinal and illicit drug use is that of impaired driving performance and traffic accidents (e.g., O&#x02019;Hanlon et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">1982</xref>; O&#x02019;Hanlon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1984</xref>; Seppala et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR55">1979</xref>). Therefore, a standardized scientific evaluation of potential drug-induced performance impairment is needed to provide more meaningful warnings to users and prescribers regarding the impacts of drugs on driving (Kay and Logan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>). In addition, there is an increasing demand from regulatory authorities to provide more information on the risks of drug-induced impairment of driving. This concerns not only newly developed medicinal drugs as part of the dossier for registration but also marketed and illicit drugs to determine thresholds for drug concentrations in blood associated with driving impairment (e.g., Verstraete et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">2011</xref>).</p><p>Methodological guidelines for experimental studies assessing the effects of drugs on driving indicated that relatively simple tests may be used as a first step in screening a drug&#x02019;s impairment potential and that more sophisticated procedures (e.g., driving simulators, on-the-road testing) should be included in a later stage (ICADTS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">1999</xref>; Kay and Logan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>; Vermeeren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">1994</xref>; Walsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2008</xref>). Among the more sophisticated tests, the standardized highway driving test developed by O&#x02019;Hanlon and colleagues is generally regarded as the gold standard to measure drug-induced driving impairment (O&#x02019;Hanlon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">1984</xref>; Verster and Roth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). However, no consensus has been reached on the specific tests to be used for initial screening. Such tests have to be widely available, easy to implement, and relatively cost effective. In order to provide relevant information, they should be valid with respect to measuring driving performance supported by theoretical models of driving (e.g., Michon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">1989</xref>), have reasonable test-retest reliability, and be sufficiently sensitive to detect drug-induced impairment (Kay and Logan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>; Walsh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2008</xref>). To ensure comparability of results from various research settings, procedures should be standardized and results calibrated by benchmark drugs and doses.</p><p>The most well-known and widely used benchmark drug for assessing drug-induced driving impairment is alcohol (e.g., Gonz&#x000e1;lez-Wilhelm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">2007</xref>; Louwerens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">1987</xref>). The increased risk of traffic accidents is well established for various legal limits of blood alcohol concentrations (BACs). Although some epidemiological studies found that the risk of being involved in a fatal crash for drivers at BACs even as low as 0.2&#x02013;0.4&#x000a0;g/L is increased (Zador et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR74">2000</xref>), most studies found that risks increase exponentially with BACs of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L and higher (e.g., Borkenstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">1964</xref>; Kr&#x000fc;ger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">1993</xref>; Schnabel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">2010</xref>). In line with this, the legal BAC limit for driving a car is set at a BAC of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L in most countries, but differences are applicable. For example, the legal limit is 0.2 and 0.8&#x000a0;g/L in Sweden and the UK, respectively. Although legal limits are societal issues, it is generally agreed that the impairment produced by BACs of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L and higher is clinically relevant. Therefore, a BAC of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L can be used to calibrate performance changes in tests measuring driving-related skills. Drug effects comparable to those of alcohol with BACs between 0.5 and 0.8&#x000a0;g/L are generally classified as moderately severe, whereas drug effects comparable with BACs over 0.8&#x000a0;g/L are classified as severe.</p><p>Review of the literature shows that a number of psychometric tests are preferably used to assess possible driving impairment, but the choice of tests differs depending on the area of research or practice. Experimental studies assessing effects of drugs and alcohol on driving and driving-related skills in healthy volunteers concluded that tracking performance and divided attention, as measured by the Critical Tracking Test (CTT) and the Divided Attention Test (DAT), are among the most sensitive tests (e.g., Moskowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1973</xref>; Ramaekers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2003</xref>; Robbe and O&#x02019;Hanlon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">1995</xref>; Verster and Roth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">2011</xref>). Clinical trials assessing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of new medicinal drugs usually include the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) to determine side effects of various doses on daytime functioning (e.g., Greenblatt et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">2006</xref>; Roth et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR53">2008</xref>). In sleep research, the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) is nowadays considered as gold standard for assessing driver drowsiness resulting from disturbed or insufficient sleep (e.g., Doran et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">2001</xref>; Jewett et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">1999</xref>). In the field of aging and dementia, tests measuring processing speed and cognitive flexibility, such as the Trail Making Test (TMT) or the Concept Shifting Test (CST), and Digit Span Test (DST) to measure memory span,&#x000a0;are often considered to be good predictors of on-road-driving performance (e.g., Clark et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">2011</xref>; Silva et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">2009</xref>). In the field of neuropsychology, a frequent used test is the Attention Network Test (ANT) (e.g., Weaver et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">2009</xref>), because it measures the efficiency of multiple attention networks in a relatively short time. Furthermore, balance tests as part of a Standardized Field Sobriety Test (SFST) are commonly used at the roadside by trained policemen (i.e., Drug Recognition Experts) in the USA and Australia to detect drug-induced driving impairment (Stuster and Burns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">1998</xref>).</p><p>The list of tests measuring driving-related and drug-induced impairment is exhaustive. Therefore, not all available tests could be included; however, we aimed to compare a number of widely used tests representative for different fields of research related to driving performance and traffic safety. The main objective of this study was to compare the relative sensitivity of these tests for the dose-dependent effects of alcohol. Since the effects of alcohol are relatively nonspecific it is expected to affect performance in most tests, in particular with a BAC of 0.8&#x000a0;g/L. More sensitive tests and parameters are assumed to show larger effect sizes and significant effects at lower BACs. A secondary objective was to establish the mean performance changes in each test associated with three increasing doses of alcohol resulting in BACs of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8&#x000a0;g/L for future reference and interpretation of the clinical relevance of drug effects, which could provide a comparison of a full range of driving-related skills.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty-five healthy male and female volunteers (ages 18&#x02013;30&#x000a0;years) were recruited through poster advertisements at Maastricht University. Initial screening was based on a medical history questionnaire examined by a medical supervisor. Accepted participants underwent a physical examination, which included standard blood hematology and chemistry, urinalysis, pregnancy tests, and tests for drugs of abuse (amphetamines, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and opiates). For participation, the following inclusion criteria had to be met: social drinking, defined as drinking at least three but no more than 21 glasses of alcohol, per week; and a Body Mass Index (BMI) between 19 and 29&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Exclusion criteria included pregnancy or lactation; any history of psychiatric or medical illness; history or current drug or alcohol abuse; current use of psychoactive medication; inability to stay abstinent during the study; excessive caffeine use, defined as drinking six or more cups of coffee per day; and habitual smoking, defined as smoking more than seven cigarettes a week.</p><p>One participant dropped out after the familiarization session for reasons unrelated to treatment. A total of 24 participants (12 men, 12 women) completed the study. The mean (&#x000b1;SD) age was 22.7 (&#x000b1;2.3) years and their mean (&#x000b1;SD) BMI was 22.5 (&#x000b1;2.0) kg/m<sup>2</sup>. The study was conducted in accordance with the code of ethics on human experimentation established by the Declaration of Helsinki (1964) and amended in Seoul (2008). All participants were informed of the study&#x02019;s goal, procedures, and potential hazards in writing, and they indicated their informed consent in writing. The Medical Ethics Committees of Maastricht University approved the study. Participants received a financial compensation for their participation in the study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Design and alcohol administration</title><p>The study was conducted according to a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-way crossover design. Treatments were alcohol doses to reach BACs of 0.0 (i.e., placebo), 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8&#x000a0;g/L. Volunteers participated in two treatment days during which two doses of alcohol were administered each day. The first dose was to achieve a low BAC (i.e., 0.0 or 0.2&#x000a0;g/L) and the second dose was to achieve a high BAC (i.e., 0.5 or 0.8&#x000a0;g/L). The order of test days was balanced over participants. The washout period was at least 1&#x000a0;week.</p><p>The placebo dose consisted of a glass of orange juice with a small amount (3&#x000a0;mL) of alcohol floating on the surface of the beverage. This is an effective procedure which indicates that the beverage contained alcohol (e.g., Fillmore and Vogel-Sprott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">1998</xref>). In the other conditions, participants were treated with several alcohol (97&#x000a0;%) challenges mixed with orange juice. Alcohol was administered orally.&#x000a0;The alcohol dosing regimen was developed to reach BACs of 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8&#x000a0;g/L. To verify this, breath samples were obtained with an alcohol breathalyzer (Dr&#x000e4;ger Alcotest 6510). The required quantity of alcohol to reach the aforementioned BACs depended on gender and weight of the individual. It was calculated by an improved version (Watson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR70">1981</xref>) of the" &#x0201c;Widmark formula&#x0201d; (Widmark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">1932</xref>). Within the improved formula, the amount of alcohol is related to the individual&#x02019;s total body water content. With consideration of the specific weight of alcohol and the BAC, the necessary quantity is calculated and divided over two glasses. Participants were allowed 5&#x000a0;min per glass to consume the drinks. A breath sample was obtained 10&#x000a0;min after the intake of each glass of alcohol. If necessary, an additional dose of alcohol was given to the participant. A breath sample was again obtained before testing started. Halfway the test session, the BAC was measured again, and an additional alcohol dose was administered if BAC had decreased below 0.1&#x000a0;g/L of the required BAC. Figure&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref> indicates a timeline of a testing day.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Timeline in minutes for alcohol administration, test performance, and obtaining BAC samples</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="213_2013_3408_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants were individually trained to perform the behavioral tests prior to the first test day. The behavioral tests were conducted twice on two separate days. Tests were always administered according to the same order: i.e., Concept Shifting Test, Critical Tracking Test, Divided Attention Test, Psychomotor Vigilance Test, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Digit Span Test, Attention Network Test, and Postural Balance Test.</p><p>During participation in the study, alcohol intake was not allowed from 24&#x000a0;h prior to each dosing until discharge. On treatment days, caffeine intake and smoking were not allowed until discharge. Participants agreed not to use any drugs of abuse or oral medication (except oral contraceptives and aspirin) during the study.</p><p>On treatment days, participants fasted for 4&#x000a0;h before arrival at the lab. Participants yielded urine and breath samples prior to each test session to confirm their compliance with prohibitions against prior use of drugs and to verify a BAC of 0.0&#x000a0;g/L at the beginning of each session. Urine samples of women were examined to exclude pregnancy. A testing day ended at 2100&#x000a0;hours at which time participants were driven home.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Assessment</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Critical Tracking Test</title><p>The Critical Tracking Test (CTT) measures the ability to control an unstable error signal in a first-order compensatory tracking task (Jex et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">1966</xref>). This test is designed to measure psychomotor coordination. Tracking skills are especially important at the operational/control level of driving behavior (e.g., keeping the car in a steady position within the lane). Participants are instructed to keep an unstable bar in the middle of a horizontal plane by counteracting or reverse its movements with the aid of a joystick. The frequency of cursor deviations at which the participant loses control is the critical frequency or lambda (<italic>&#x003bb;</italic><sub>c</sub>, in rad/s). The final score is determined from the average of all but the lowest and highest scores in five trails. Total duration of the test is approximately 3&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Divided Attention Test</title><p>The Divided Attention Test (DAT) measures the ability to perform two tasks simultaneously (Moskowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">1973</xref>). In the primary task, the participants perform the same tracking task described above, set at a constant&#x000a0;level of difficulty. In the other task, the participant monitors 24 peripheral displays in which single digits change asynchronously at 5-s intervals. Participants are instructed to remove their foot from a pedal as rapidly as possible whenever the digit &#x0201c;2&#x0201d; appears. This signal occurs twice at every location, in random order, at intervals of 5&#x02013;25&#x000a0;s. Tracking error (DAT-ER, in mm) and average reaction time to targets (DAT-RT, in ms) are the respective performance measures. Duration of the task is 12&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Psychomotor Vigilance Test</title><p>The Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT) is based on a simple visual reaction time test (Dinges and Powell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">1985</xref>). The test measures ability to sustain attention over a period of 10&#x000a0;min. Participants are required to respond to a visual stimulus presented at a&#x000a0;variable interval (2,000 to 10,000&#x000a0;ms) by pressing a button with the dominant hand. The visual stimulus is a counter turning on and incrementing from 0 to 60&#x000a0;s at 1-ms intervals. If a response has not been made in 60&#x000a0;s, the clock resets and the counter restarts. The reciprocal transform of the reaction time (1/RT) was calculated because it emphasizes slowing in the optimum and intermediate response domain and substantially decreases the contribution of long lapses. For calculation of mean 1/RT, each RT (ms) was divided by 1,000 and then reciprocally transformed. This measure has shown to indicate the largest effect sizes when taking mean reaction times into account (Basner and Dinges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Attention Network Test</title><p>The Attention Network Test (ANT) provides measures of three functions of attention within a single task: alertness, orienting, and executive control (Fan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">2002</xref>). Each trial begins with the presentation of a fixation cross in the middle of the computer screen. Participants are instructed to keep their eyes fixated on the cross throughout the test. Then, at some variable interval (ranging from 400 to 1,600&#x000a0;ms), a cue is presented for 100&#x000a0;ms. Four hundred milliseconds after the offset of the cue, a target display appears and remains until response (i.e., a key-press indicating the direction of the target arrow), or for 1,700&#x000a0;ms if no response is made. The interstimulus interval is 3,500&#x000a0;ms. There are four cue conditions and three target conditions. Targets (neutral, congruent, or incongruent) can appear either above or below the fixation cross. Dependent variables are total reaction time (RT) and differences between RTs reflecting efficiency of alerting (RT no cue&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;RT double cue), orienting (RT center cue&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;RT spatial cue), and executive networks (RT incongruent flankers&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;RT congruent flankers). Duration of the test is approximately 25&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Digit Symbol Substitution Test</title><p>The Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) measures many different psychomotor and cognitive functions at the same time (Riedel et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">2006</xref>). A computerized version of the original paper-and-pencil test (McLeod et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">1982</xref>) taken from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale is used (e.g., Leufkens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>). The participant is required to match each digit with a symbol from the encoding list as rapidly as possible by clicking the corresponding response button, using the mouse. The number of digits encoded correctly within 3&#x000a0;min is the performance measure.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Concept Shifting Test</title><p>The computerized Concept Shifting Test (CST) is used to measure processing speed and cognitive flexibility (Van der Elst et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR60">2006</xref>). It consists of three subtasks (A, B, and C). On each display, 16 small circles are grouped into one larger circle. In the smaller circles, the test items appear in a fixed random order. Participants are asked to cross out numbers (1&#x02013;16) in the right order as quickly and accurately as possible, using a touch screen. In part B, the circles contain letters (A&#x02013;P) that have to be crossed out in alphabetical order. In part C, both numbers and letters are displayed, and the participant is requested to alternate between numbers and letters. The time needed to complete each part is scored&#x000a0;in seconds (CST-A, CST-B, and CST-C, respectively). An interference score (CST<sub>i</sub>) was obtained by the following formula: (CST-C&#x02009;&#x02212;&#x02009;&#x000bd;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(CST-A&#x02009;+&#x02009;CST-B))&#x02009;/&#x02009;(&#x000bd;&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;(CST-A&#x02009;+&#x02009;CST-B))&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;100. Total duration of the test is approximately 3&#x000a0;min.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Digit Span Test</title><p>The Digit Span Test (DST) measures memory span. It consists of two parts: one for forward digit span and one for backward digit span. In the forward part of the DST (Wechsler <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">1997</xref>), the experimenter reads various&#x000a0;series of digits, 1&#x02013;9, to the participant. The series are increased in length by one digit from trial to trial. Two sequences are presented for each span size. The instruction is to remember the digits and recall them immediately in correct serial order. Testing stops when the participant makes a mistake in both trials of the same span length. In the backward part of the DST, sequences of numbers are read out to participants who are asked to repeat them, in reverse order. The number of sequences correctly recalled forward and backward is recorded (DST-FW, DST-BW).

Balance is measured using the AMTI AccuSway System for Balance and Postural Sway Measurement (Advanced Mechanical Technology, Inc., Watertown, MA, USA) force platform (Mets et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">2011</xref>). Postural sway is assessed by measuring the length of the path of the center of pressure (COP) and the area of the 95&#x000a0;% confidence ellipse enclosing the COP (A95). The test is conducted in two trials of both 60&#x000a0;s: one trial with the participants&#x02019; eyes open and one trial with eyes closed, both with feet apart at the hip&#x02019;s width.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Subjective measures</title><p>Participants had to describe their subjective feeling in three dimensions (i.e., alertness, contentedness, and calmness) by using 16 Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) (Bond and Lader <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">1974</xref>). An additional scale was added on which participants could indicate their perceived&#x000a0;degrees of intoxication. All scales were administered twice: once before testing started in a treatment condition and once afterward. After a testing day, participants were asked to estimate their level of intoxication (i.e., a BAC of 0.0, 0.2, 0.5, or 0.8&#x000a0;g/L) by a fixed choice question (i.e., &#x0201c;which BAC do you think we aimed to reach?&#x0201d;) for both test sessions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Sample size calculation was based on detecting a minimally relevant difference with an effect size of 0.25 between placebo and the 0.5&#x000a0;g/L BAC condition.

Three separate alcohol-placebo contrasts were conducted when an overall effect of alcohol was found.

This was examined by assessing their ability to detect the effects of various doses of alcohol resulting in BACs between 0.0 and 0.8&#x000a0;g/L. Eight tests were included measuring various skills related to driving, such as psychomotor speed (CTT, ANT, PVT, DSST, DAT), divided attention (DAT), sustained attention (PVT), spatial attention (ANT), executive attention (ANT, CST), memory span (DST), and postural balance (PBT). The results showed that tasks and parameters varied in their sensitivity to the effects of alcohol.</p><p>All tests except the DST and CST showed statistically significant effects of alcohol intoxication. In terms of effects sizes, the largest and strongest dose-dependent effects of alcohol were found on performance in the PBT, PVT, and DAT. Only these tests showed significant impairment at a BAC of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L, the clinically relevant cutoff point as it is the legal limit for driving under the influence in most countries. Effect sizes for reaction time in the DAT and PVT were moderate (i.e., 0.39 and 0.29, respectively) at a BAC of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L and large (i.e., 0.65 and 0.70) at a BAC of 0.8&#x000a0;g/L. At the PBT with eyes open, a large effect size (i.e., 0.77) was found between placebo and a BAC of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L and a very large effect size (i.e., 1.50) between placebo and a BAC of 0.8&#x000a0;g/L.</p><p>Most of the findings of the present study regarding the effects of alcohol on performance tests are in line with previous studies. Several studies support our finding that performance in the DAT, PVT and PBT is sensitive to low or moderate BACs (e.g., Evans and Levin, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>;&#x000a0;Howard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">2007</xref>; Leung et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">2012</xref>; McCaul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2000</xref>; Moskowitz and Robinson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">1988</xref>; Moskowitz and Florentino <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">2000</xref>; Ogden and Moskowitz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">2004</xref>; Roehrs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR52">2003</xref>). Furthermore, the failure of the CST to show any effects of alcohol is in line with recent findings that performance in a similar test (i.e., TMT - part B) was only impaired at a very high BAC (i.e., 1.2 g/L), but not at lower BACs (i.e., 0.5 and 0.8 g/L) as used in the present study (Dry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Finally, our finding that the DSST shows impairment at a BAC of 0.8 g/L, but not below is in line with most previous studies. All studies have shown impairment at BACs of 0.8 g/L or more, but results are not consistent at BACs between 0.4 and 0.6 g/L ( Brasser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">2004</xref>; Brumback et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">2007</xref>; Dumont et al., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">2008</xref>; Evans and Levin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">2004</xref>; Holdstock and de Wit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">2001</xref>; King and Byars <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">2004</xref>; McCaul et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">2000</xref>).</p><p>Regarding the CTT in the present study, impairment was found at a BAC of 0.2 and 0.8&#x000a0;g/L, but not at a BAC of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L. The failure of the CTT to show impairment at a BAC of 0.5 g/L was unexpected. Several studies found&#x000a0;impaired tracking performance at BACs ranging from 0.4 to 0.6&#x000a0;g/L (Kuypers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">2006</xref>; Ramaekers et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">2011b</xref>; Vermeeren and O&#x02019;Hanlon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">1998</xref>; Vermeeren et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">2002</xref>). Only one study did not find impairment at a BAC of 0.64&#x000a0;g/L (Simons et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">2012</xref>). Even though participants were extensively trained in the current study, a learning effect could have occurred in participants who completed the 0.5&#x000a0;g/L condition at the end of the second testing day. Based on previous findings, the CTT should indicate impairment at a BAC of 0.5&#x000a0;g/L, and therefore, this test should not be excluded as a test for initial screening. However, quantifying drug effects comparable to various BACs according to the present study should be done with caution, as no alcohol dose-dependent curve at the CTT was found in the present study.</p><p>The results of this study help further research to quantify drug effects. For example, the hypnotics gaboxadol (15 mg) and zolpidem (10 mg) taken in the middle of the night were found to increase reaction time in the DAT the next morning on average by 184 ms (Leufkens et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">2009</xref>). These effects are comparable to the effects of a BAC of 0.8 g/L on the same test in the present study. In contrast, zopiclone (7.5 mg) taken at bedtime in the same study, increased next day reaction time in the DAT on average by 123 ms, which is comparable to a BAC of 0.5 g/L or lower according to the present study. Another study found a reaction time increase of 95&#x000a0;ms at the PVT for partial sleep deprivation compared with placebo, which is comparable to a BAC higher than 0.8&#x000a0;g/L (Bosker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">2010</xref>).</p><p>One of the reasons why the PVT and DAT are more sensitive to impairment may be related to their longer duration. The duration of the PVT and DAT is 10 and 12&#x000a0;min, respectively, whereas many other tests take no more than 2 or 3&#x000a0;min to complete (e.g., DST, CTT, CST, and DSST). Tests of longer duration may induce a vigilance decrement, which may enhance the impairing effects of sedative drugs. In shorter tests, a temporary increase of effort may compensate the impairing effects. Sensitivity of a test is however not only determined by its duration, as shown by the relatively small effects on performance in the longest test in the present study, the Attention Network Test, which has a duration of approximately 25&#x000a0;min.</p><p>One limitation of the present study is that not all available tests measuring driving-related skills could be included to compare all these tests in one study. More studies are needed comparing other tests. Recently, one other study compared six tests using dose-related effects of alcohol (Dry et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">2012</xref>). Based on strenghts of dose-dependent effects and effect sizes, the authors concluded that the Inspection Time test (measuring information processing speed), the Self-Ordered Pointing Task (measuring working memory) and the Sustained Attention to Response Task (measuring response inhibition and cognitive flexibility) were better suited to detect impairing effects of alcohol than the TMT, the Useful Field of View test, and a problem solving test.</p><p>Furthermore, the question remains how valid laboratory tests are to assess the domains of driving as proposed by several researchers. According to Walsh et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">2008</xref>), three core levels of behavior should be measured to predict crash risks: (1) automative behavior, (2) control behavior, and (3) executive planning behavior. Furthermore, five essential driving ability domains were indicated: (1) alertness/arousal, (2) attention and processing speed, (3) reaction time/psychomotor functions, (4) sensory-perceptual functioning, and (5) executive functions (Kay and Logan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">2011</xref>). It could be argued that the DAT is a relatively complex task incorporating all aspects, whereas the PVT is a relatively simple task which may be considered to be less sensitive to deficits in executive functioning. When using the PVT, an additional test for executive function deficits may be needed to cover the most relevant domains for driving. The validity of the PBT is less clear; it is not known whether the PBT is a valid measure of actual driving and whether it can predict actual driving performance. To predict actual driving impairment, the CTT and DAT have been found to moderately predict performance at the on-the-road driving test (Ramaekers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR47">2003</xref>; Verster and Roth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR65">2012</xref>).</p><p>Another aspect is that effects of sedative drugs or sedative conditions (e.g., sleep deprivation) can be quantified comparable to a particular BAC. Although there are many different drugs with differing mechanisms of action, one of the most common drug effects relevant for potential driving impairment is sedation or drowsiness, which is usually associated with slowing of responses and attentional deficits. It should however be noted that sedative drugs, sleep deprivation, and alcohol can have qualitatively different effects, as has been found previously (e.g., Kleykamp et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">2010</xref>; Tiplady et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR59">2003</xref>). We are currently exploring the differential effects of sleep deprivation and sedative drugs on tests measuring driving-related skills.</p><p>In conclusion, the preferable tests for initial screening are the DAT and the PVT, as these tests were most sensitive to the impairing effects of alcohol and being considerably valid in assessing potential driving impairment because of sedation or drowsiness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Peter van Mulken and Joyce Weisser for their contribution to this study.</p><sec id="d30e2857"><title>Conflict of interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></sec></ack><ref-list id="Bib1"><title>References</title><ref id="CR1"><mixed-citation publication-type="other">Basner M,&#x000a0; Dinges DF (2011) Maximizing sensitivity of the psychomotor vigilance test (PVT) to sleep loss.
