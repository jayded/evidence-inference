mutualistic ecosystem layout are considered a key environmental factor contributing to the
disease. Thus, the possibility of improving metabolic control in T2D by correcting gut
microbiome dysbioses through diet has been evaluated. Here, we explore the potential of
two different energy-restricted dietary approaches &#x02013; the fibre-rich macrobiotic Ma-Pi 2
diet or a control diet recommended by Italian professional societies for T2D treatment &#x02013;
to correct gut microbiota dysbioses in T2D patients. In a previous 21-d open-label MADIAB
trial, fifty-six overweight T2D patients were randomised to the Ma-Pi 2 or the control
diet. For the present study, stools were collected before and after intervention from a
subset of forty MADIAB participants, allowing us to characterise the gut microbiota by 16S
rRNA sequencing and imputed metagenomics. To highlight microbiota dysbioses in T2D, the
gut microbiota of thirteen normal-weight healthy controls were characterised. According to
our findings, both diets were effective in modulating gut microbiome dysbioses in T2D,
resulting in an increase of the ecosystem diversity and supporting the recovery of a
balanced community of health-promoting SCFA producers, such as
<italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, <italic>Roseburia</italic>,
<italic>Lachnospira</italic>, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and
<italic>Akkermansia</italic>. The Ma-Pi 2 diet, but not the control diet, was also
effective in counteracting the increase of possible pro-inflammatory groups, such as
<italic>Collinsella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>, in the gut ecosystem,
showing the potential to reverse pro-inflammatory dysbioses in T2D, and possibly
explaining the greater efficacy in improving the metabolic control.</p></abstract><kwd-group><title>Key words</title><kwd>Type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>Gut microbiota</kwd><kwd>Dysbiosis</kwd><kwd>Fibre-rich diets</kwd><kwd>Macrobiotic diets</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="abbreviations"><title>Abbreviations</title><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">CTR</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">control diet</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">FBG</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">fasting blood glucose</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">GM</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">gut microbiota</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">KO</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">KEGG Orthology</compound-kwd-part></compound-kwd><compound-kwd><compound-kwd-part content-type="abbrev">PCoA</compound-kwd-part><compound-kwd-part content-type="expansion">principal coordinates

suggested to be the basis of chronic inflammatory processes observed in T2D, and the new
concept of metabolic infection has been proposed<sup>(</sup>

GM components can penetrate the epithelial barrier and aggravate metabolic inflammation and
insulin resistance in T2D<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">

control (CTR) diet, which is based on the dietary guidelines recommended by professional
societies in Italy, for the improvement of metabolic control in T2D patients<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Conceived by Mario Pianesi, the Ma-Pi 2 diet is a fibre-rich macrobiotic diet
with a prebiotic potential, which is in line with the dietary recommendations of the Academy
of Nutrition and Dietetics<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>22</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Specifically, the Ma-Pi 2 diet is enriched in complex carbohydrates, legumes,
fermented products, sea salt and green tea, and it excludes fat and protein from animal source
and added sugars. In a 21-d controlled open-label trial (MADIAB trial), fifty-six overweight
T2D patients were randomised (1:1 ratio) to the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet or the CTR diet. At
the end of this short-term nutritional intervention, the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet proved to be
more effective in reducing fasting and postprandial blood glucose, glycated Hb (HbA1c), serum
cholesterol, homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), BMI and waist and
hip circumferences compared with the CTR diet<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>21</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. According to the authors, the greater effect of the high-fibre Ma-Pi 2 diet on
several metabolic parameters of T2D patients was probably because of, at least in part, an
inherent capability of favouring the recovery of a mutualistic GM layout. To verify this
hypothesis, in this study, we specifically compared the efficacy of the Ma-Pi 2 and the CTR
diet in modulating GM dysbioses in a subset of forty overweight T2D patients participating in
the MADIAB trial, for whom stools were successfully collected before and after intervention.
To this aim, stools were analysed for the microbiota composition by next-generation sequencing
(NGS) of the 16S rRNA gene and imputed metagenomics. To provide a picture of the baseline GM
dysbioses in the enrolled T2D patients, their microbiota profiles were compared with those of
thirteen normal-weight healthy controls. Our findings suggest that the Ma-Pi 2 diet has the
potential to reverse compositional and functional GM dysbioses in T2D, favouring the recovery
of a mutualistic configuration capable of supporting the host energy homeostasis.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1"><title>Methods</title><sec id="sec1-1" sec-type="general"><title>Study design</title><p>The design of the MADIAB trial is described in Soare <italic>et al</italic>.<sup>(</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. Briefly, it was designed as a 21-d controlled open-label trial, in which the
participants were assigned (1:1) to the Ma-Pi 2 macrobiotic diet or a CTR diet based on
the dietary guidelines for T2D recommended by professional societies in Italy. The trial
was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and the Good Clinical
Practice guidelines, and the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of
University Campus Bio-Medico (trial registration number ISRCTN10467793; <uri xlink:type="simple" xlink:href="http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10467793">http://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN10467793</uri>). Written informed consent was obtained from
all subjects/patients. The Department of Endocrinology and Diabetes of the University
Campus Bio-Medico in Rome (Italy) recruited overweight or obese (BMI 27&#x02013;45
kg/m<sup>2</sup>) subjects, aged 40&#x02013;77 years and affected by T2D (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1">Table 1</xref>). Associated metabolic syndrome was evaluated according to the
National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, although it was
not an inclusion criterion. Inclusion criteria were as follows: T2D diagnosed at least 1
year before the start of the trial, treated exclusively with dietary intervention, oral
hypoglycaemic drugs or both for 6 months before study entry. Exclusion criteria were as
follows: the use of insulin either at present or at any time in the 2 year before the
study, current use of corticosteroid therapy or any other drug that can interfere with
carbohydrate metabolism, alcohol abuse and pregnancy. Subjects who already followed a
macrobiotic diet were excluded from the study. Participants&#x02019; eating habits concerning the
period antecedent the study start were assessed using qualitative and quantitative
questionnaires (online Supplementary Table S1). Eligible T2D subjects were divided into
two groups according to the diet randomly assigned (twenty-eight participants were
randomised to the Ma-Pi 2 diet and twenty-eight to the CTR diet), and they were
accommodated in two different hotels, which were located close to each other.
Randomisation was stratified by BMI at baseline and by sex.<table-wrap id="tab1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Anthropometric characteristics of type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients, measured at T0

to 7949 kJ (1900 kcal) for men and 7113 kJ (1700 kcal) for women (online Supplementary

lunch and dinner) and two snacks, 2&#x000b7;5 h after breakfast and lunch. Every participant was
informed that a leftover &#x02265;5 % of the total food intake meant the dismissal from the trial.
Participants were asked to keep their exercise habits unvaried during the intervention
period, and their physical activity was registered using a pedometer (Tri-axial activity
monitor, XL-18/XL-18 CN-AND; A&#x00026;D Medical). Primary outcomes were the change in
fasting blood glucose (FBG) and postprandial blood glucose (PPBG) levels from the baseline
(T0) to the 21st day of treatment (T1). Secondary outcomes included changes from baseline
in plasma concentration of HbA1c, total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol and

was characterised by NGS of the V3&#x02013;V4 region of the 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (online
Supplementary Fig. S1). A total of 3 198 509 high-quality reads were obtained, with a mean

identity. Rarefaction curves obtained with Shannon, Chao1, PD (phylogenetic diversity)
whole tree and observed species phylogenetic metrics approximated the saturation level
after 3300 reads (online Supplementary Fig. S1).</p><p>To characterise GM dysbioses in T2D at the enrolment, the compositional structure of the
GM at T0 was compared with that of healthy controls. In the online Supplementary Table S1,
we provide the dietary behaviours during the 6 months before the trial for all T2D
patients, as well as the dietary habits of the healthy controls. T2D patients were
characterised by a significant reduction of the GM Shannon diversity index
(<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05, Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed rank-sum test). Even if it cannot be
excluded that the age differences between T2D patients (mean age 66 years) and healthy
controls (mean age 32 years) contribute, at least in part, to the observed differences in
GM diversity, we failed to detect any significant correlation between age and microbiome
diversity in our data set (online Supplementary Fig. S2). The PCoA of the weighted UniFrac
distances resulted in a significant segregation between the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1(a)</xref>) (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;001,

compositional differences in the GM structure of T2D patients and healthy controls. To
identify the microbial genera responsible for this separation, the biplot of the average
bacterial coordinates weighted by the corresponding bacterial abundance per sample was
superimposed on the PCoA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Fig. 1(b)</xref>), as

</p><p>We then explored the impact of dietary interventions on the GM ecosystem of T2D patients.
To visualise the total variation in the data set, a PCoA analysis of the weighted UniFrac
distances between the Ma-Pi 2 and CTR groups at T0 and T1 and the healthy controls was
performed (online Supplementary Fig. S3). The PC2 axis &#x02013; which accounts for 24 % of the
total variability &#x02013; was positively associated with T2D (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0&#x000b7;05,
Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed rank-sum test). Thus, the efficacy of dietary interventions in
redressing T2D-associated GM-dysbioses was assessed by comparing the variation of the
average (&#x000b1;<sc>sem</sc>) PC2 coordinates for each group of samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>). Although at T0 both Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet groups showed
significantly higher PC2 coordinates compared with healthy controls
(<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;01 and <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;03, respectively), at T1 no significant
difference between both diet groups and healthy controls was observed. These data support
the potential of both dietary interventions to redress T2D-associated GM dysbioses,
favouring the recovery of a mutualistic ecosystem layout.<fig id="fig2" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 2</label><caption><p>Variation of the weighted UniFrac PC2 coordinates between the study groups.

</p><p>The specificity of each dietary intervention in correcting the GM dysbioses in T2D
patients was evaluated by comparing the compositional structure of the GM ecosystem before
(T0) and after (T1) the nutritional intervention, as reported in the two PCoA plots of
weighted UniFrac distances, which also included the responding bacterial genera and
biochemical parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). A significant
segregation between the GM profiles at T0 and T1 was obtained for both interventions
(<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;01 and <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;04 for Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet,
respectively; permutation test with pseudo <italic>F</italic> ratios), indicating that
both diets were effective in modulating the GM of T2D patients. Although both diets tended
to increase the GM Shannon diversity (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;09 and <italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;06
for Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet, respectively; Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed rank-sum test), no significant
difference in within-group diversity between time points was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3</xref>). Interestingly, in the case of the Ma-Pi 2
diet, we detected significant associations between changes in GM components and changes in
biochemical parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3(a)</xref>). In particular,
<italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, which increased at T1, showed an inverse association
with FBG. Analogously, <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, both
positively responding to the Ma-Pi 2 diet, showed an inverse trend with respect to total

</p><p>To dissect the specific GM compositional changes in response to the dietary regimen, we
focused our analysis on the core GM community, defined as the sum of the microbial genera
present at a relative abundance &#x0003e;1 % in at least 30 % of the subjects. Selected
genera accounted together for &#x0003e;80 % of the total ecosystem. To estimate the degree
of dysbiosis of the core GM in T2D, the ratio of the median genus abundance in T2D
patients and healthy controls was calculated. The heat map of the log-ratios at T0 and T1
for the Ma-Pi 2 and the CTR diet is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Fig.
4</xref>. According to our findings, both diets were effective in counteracting the
decrease of <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, <italic>Dorea</italic> and
<italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> in T2D patients, as demonstrated by the recovery of
median abundance values similar to those of healthy controls. Moreover, both Ma-Pi 2 and
CTR diet resulted in an increase of <italic>Akkermansia</italic> above the abundance
values characteristic of healthy controls. On the other hand, both diets supported the
reduction of Lachnospiraceae:<italic>Ruminococcus</italic> down to the median abundance
values shown by healthy controls. Diet-specific effects on the GM composition of T2D
patients regarded only a few genera under-represented in T2D patients compared with
healthy controls: <italic>Lachnospira</italic> and <italic>Roseburia</italic>, for which
only the CTR diet favoured the recovery of health-like median abundance values, and
<italic>Oscillospira</italic>, for which the recovery of health-like values occurred
only in the Ma-Pi 2 diet group. Conversely, the genera <italic>Collinsella</italic> and
<italic>Streptococcus</italic>, and unclassified Lachnospiraceae, which were enriched in
T2D patients compared with healthy controls, decreased down to health-like abundances only
in patients who underwent the Ma-Pi 2 diet intervention.<fig id="fig4" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 4</label><caption><p>Impact of dietary interventions on the taxonomic structure of the core microbiota

</p><p>To highlight specific dietary features affecting the GM composition, a comparison between
the microbiota profiles at T1 of the two groups was performed, taking into account also
the dietary features of the two different interventions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig. 5</xref>). T1 samples from the Ma-Pi 2 diet group showed significantly higher
abundance of Peptostreptococcaceae (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;02; Wilcoxon&#x02019;s signed rank-sum
test) and Leuconostocaceae (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;0002), which were also positively
correlated with the ingested amount of dietary components that were represented in a
higher percentage in Ma-Pi 2 compared with the CTR diet (whole grain 28&#x000b7;1
<italic>v.</italic> 8&#x000b7;5 %, vegetables, sauces and herbs 64&#x000b7;5 <italic>v.</italic> 32&#x000b7;0 %),
or only present in the Ma-Pi 2 diet (seeds, seaweeds and fermented products) (see also
online Supplementary Table S2). On the contrary, bacteria from the family
Erysipelotrichaceae showed significantly higher abundance in T1 samples from the CTR diet
group (<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;008), and were positively correlated with the ingested amount
of dietary components present only in CTR diet (bread, cereal, pasta and grains, meats,
eggs and meat broths, dairy products, fruit and fruit juice and extra-virgin olive oil).
The same positive correlations were obtained for Coriobacteriaceae, even if the abundance
of this bacterial family was not significantly higher in the CTR diet group T1 samples.
This bacterial group also showed a positive correlation with the food category &#x02018;other
starch&#x02019; (containing legumes and potatoes), which was more represented in the CTR diet than
in the Ma-Pi 2 diet (5&#x000b7;5 <italic>v.</italic> 3&#x000b7;0 %). This food category was also
correlated to the Ruminococcaceae family.<fig id="fig5" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Fig. 5</label><caption><p>Impact of dietary components on the gut microbiota taxonomic structure. Cladogram

separate clustering between the gut microbiome structure of T2D patients at T0 and healthy

the metabolic pathways in all samples, weighted by gene count per sample, were obtained
and the resulting biplot of pathway distribution was superimposed on the PCA plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Fig. 6</xref>). The pathways clustering with T2D patients and
healthy controls are listed in the online Supplementary Table S3. In the context of this
functional separation, T2D patients showed a general perturbation in microbiome pathways
involved in the metabolism of amino acids, lipids and secondary metabolites. In
particular, T2D patients were depleted in genes involved in the metabolism of
<sc>d</sc>-arginine and <sc>d</sc>-ornithine, as well as of <sc>d</sc>-glutamine and
<sc>d</sc>-glutamate, while being enriched in pathways involved in tyrosine metabolism and
alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. This functional layout may lead to a reduced
production of arginine &#x02013; as a result of both the reduction of pathways directly involved
in arginine biosynthesis and the lower amount of glutamate available for arginine
biosynthesis &#x02013; and to a corresponding increase in alanine levels. Although arginine has
been reported as insulinogenic<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">

in higher levels of the 4-cresol metabolite, which has been associated with diverse
inflammatory conditions in the gut<sup>(</sup>

</p><p>With the aim to explore the impact of nutritional interventions on the functional

diet, which resulted in no significant functional change in the predicted gut metagenome
(<italic>P</italic>=0&#x000b7;4, permutation test with pseudo <italic>F</italic> ratios), the
Ma-Pi 2 diet was effective in modulating the GM metagenome in T2D patients, as

counteracted the functional dysbioses in the GM of T2D patients, resulting in the decrease
of the abundance of several T2D-associated GM functional markers, such as alanine
metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and polyketide sugar biosynthesis, as well as in
the reduction of GM functions related to oxidative phosphorylation and glycosphingolipid
biosynthesis. Moreover, the Ma-Pi 2 diet favoured an increase in GM functions involved in
<sc>d</sc>-glutamine and <sc>d</sc>-glutamate metabolism, previously reported as reduced
in T2D patients, and in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, which have been shown

<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">

feature shared by several disease-associated dysbiotic microbiome configurations, such as
those associated with inflammatory bowel disease and age<sup>(</sup>

T2D corresponded to phylogenetic changes. T2D patients were indeed enriched in
<italic>Lactobacillus</italic>, Lachnospiraceae:<italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and in
several potential pro-inflammatory GM components, such as Enterobacteriaceae,

<italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic>. Strengthening these findings,
analogous T2D-associated GM structural dysbioses have already been identified in previous

<sup>)</sup>. Subsequently, we explored the changes in GM functions matching these
compositional perturbations by inferred metagenomics. Our data suggest deregulation in
pathways involved in the metabolism of amino acids, lipids and secondary metabolites in the
GM of T2D patients, including a reduced abundance of functions for the metabolism of
<sc>d</sc>-arginine and <sc>d</sc>-ornithine, as well as of <sc>d</sc>-glutamine and
<sc>d</sc>-glutamate, a corresponding increase in the metabolism of tyrosine, alanine,
aspartate and glutamate, and a higher load of functions involved in arachidonic acid
metabolism and polyketide sugar biosynthesis.</p><p>The observed T2D-related dysbiotic microbial community could exert a multifactorial role in
the disease onset, contributing to metabolic and immune deregulation. Indeed, the T2D GM is
slightly depleted in fibrolytic health-promoting mutualists, fundamental for providing
butyrate and propionate from the degradation of indigestible plant polysaccharides and
starch, such as the butyrate-producing <italic>Dorea</italic>, <italic>Lachnospira</italic>,
<italic>Roseburia</italic> and <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>, and the
propionate-producing <italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Prevotella</italic>
<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref48" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>48</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Even if the biological relevance of this depletion of SCFA producers remains
to be determined, it could result in the reduction of bioavailability of these crucial GM
metabolites in the gut, with consequences on the host metabolic and immunological
homeostasis. For instance, butyrate and propionate are important for host glucose
control<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">

gluconeogenesis<sup>(</sup>

<sup>,</sup>
<xref rid="ref49" ref-type="bibr">

regulatory T-cell generation<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref50" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>50</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> and in the regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokine production<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref51" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>51</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In parallel, the observed increase of potential pro-inflammatory
micro-organisms in the gut of T2D patients, such as Enterobacteriaceae,
<italic>Collinsella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>

<sup>)</sup>, could further contribute to raise the host inflammatory level, supporting the
evolution of insulin resistance<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref52" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>52</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Finally, the functional GM layout of T2D patients we obtained by imputed
metagenomics suggests additional mechanisms involved in the GM contribution to the disease,
including the reduced production of the insulinogenic arginine<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>34</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, and the increased production of alanine, a recognised marker of higher energy
intake and cholesterol level<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>35</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, which could contribute to the loss of metabolic control in T2D. Moreover, the
higher potential for the production of tyrosine metabolites could further boost
pro-inflammatory stimuli in the gut<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>36</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Interestingly, the survey of GM in T2D patients allowed us to find traces of
functions related to immune escaping, such as pathways involved in the metabolism of
arachidonic acid and polyketide sugar biosynthesis, further highlighting the ongoing bloom
of pro-inflammatory GM components in T2D<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>39</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. However, the functional conclusions derived from imputed metagenomics must be
taken with caution until experimentally confirmed by shotgun metagenomics.</p><p>In the subset of forty MADIAB participants &#x02013; twenty-one assigned to the Ma-Pi 2 diet and
nineteen to the CTR diet &#x02013; we then explored the efficacy of the nutritional interventions in
supporting the recovery of a mutualistic GM configuration in T2D patients. Primary and
secondary outcomes were re-analysed for this patient subset included in the gut microbiome
study, confirming that the Ma-Pi 2 diet was associated with a greater reduction in FBG and
PPBG, total serum cholesterol, CRP and IL-6 in T2D patients. According to gut microbiome
data, both Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diet were able to modulate the GM dysbioses in T2D patients,
supporting the recovery of a healthy-like compositional structure and resulting in an
increased ecosystem diversity, which represents a strategic feature for a healthy GM
ecosystem<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref53" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>53</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. In addition, both diets supported the recovery of a balanced health-promoting
community of fibrolytic SCFA producers in the gut of T2D patients, by re-increasing the
abundance of propionate and butyrate producers (i.e. <italic>Bacteroides</italic>,
<italic>Dorea</italic>, <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>) and consolidating a
healthy-like abundance of <italic>Roseburia</italic>, <italic>Lachnospira</italic>,
Lachnospiraceae:<italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Oscillospira</italic>. Moreover,
both dietary interventions resulted in the increase of <italic>Akkermansia</italic>, a human
mucus coloniser recently correlated to an improved metabolic profile<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>54</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, providing the rationale for its use in the prevention or treatment of obesity
and associated metabolic disorders. Finally, it is important to point out that only the
Ma-Pi 2 diet showed the potential to counteract the rise of putative pro-inflammatory
components (i.e. <italic>Collinsella</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus</italic>) in the GM
ecosystem of T2D patients. When we sought associations between GM components and biochemical
parameters, significant trends were obtained only in the case of the Ma-Pi 2 diet. Indeed,
in Ma-Pi 2-treated subjects, the abundance of <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic> was
negatively associated with FBG and, analogously, the abundance of
<italic>Bacteroides</italic> and <italic>Akkermansia</italic> showed an inverse association
with total and LDL-cholesterol. Conversely, Lachnospiraceae:<italic>Ruminococcus</italic>
was positively associated with FBG. These findings suggest that these micro-organisms, the
first increasing and the latter decreasing in response to the Ma-Pi 2 diet, could represent
Ma-Pi 2-responding GM components associated with primary and secondary study outcomes.
Supporting our findings, the negative association between <italic>Faecalibacterium</italic>
and FBG concentration had already been detected in a study exploring the structural
modulation of the GM in T2D subjects treated with a Chinese herbal formula<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>55</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Moreover, in a study carried out in mice, <italic>Akkermansia
muciniphila</italic> treatment has been demonstrated to reverse high-fat diet-induced
metabolic disorders, including fat-mass gain, metabolic endotoxaemia, adipose tissue
inflammation and insulin resistance<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref54" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>54</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. On the other hand, Lachnospiraceae:<italic>Ruminococcus</italic> has recently
been positively correlated with insulin resistance in obese women<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref56" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>56</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. According to imputed metagenomics, only the Ma-Pi 2 diet resulted in a
significant modulation of the functional microbiome layout in T2D patients. In particular,
the decrease of several markers of functional GM dysbioses in T2D patients, such as
imbalances in alanine metabolism, arachidonic acid metabolism and polyketide sugar
biosynthesis, was observed. Moreover, the Ma-Pi 2 diet favoured the reduction of GM
functions related to oxidative phosphorylation and glycosphingolipids biosynthesis.
Anaerobic respiration provides an ecological advantage for Enterobacteriaceae in an inflamed
gut<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>39</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>, whereas glycosphingolipids are powerful bacterial modulators of the host
inflammatory response<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref40" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>40</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Thus, the reduction in abundance of these pathways further suggests the
potential of Ma-Pi 2 diet to counteract the ongoing bloom of pro-inflammatory pathobionts in
T2D. Finally, the Ma-Pi 2 diet favoured the increase of GM functions involved in the
biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids and essential amino acids, showing an added
potential to promote the recovery of metabolic control and a balanced nutritional status in
T2D patients.</p><p>In conclusion, both Ma-Pi 2 and CTR diets showed the potential to support the recovery of
GM-host mutualism in T2D patients, favouring the restoration of fibrolytic SCFA-producing GM
components, thus promoting metabolic control of T2D patients. Differently from the CTR diet,
the Ma-Pi 2 diet was effective in counteracting the rise of possible pro-inflammatory
micro-organisms in T2D patients. This suggests that the Ma-Pi 2 diet may have the potential
to reduce GM-dependent pro-inflammatory stimuli in the gut that, increasing chronic
inflammation, can lead to insulin resistance in T2D<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>57</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. Even if direct causation still needs to be proved, and this conclusion must be
taken with adequate caution, this peculiar property shown by the Ma-Pi 2 diet could partly
explain the greater improvements in metabolic control following Ma-Pi 2 dietary intervention
compared with the CTR diet<sup>(</sup>
