The symptoms are usually mild and often related to the common cold. In streptococcal infection the tonsils often swell and become coated and the throat is sore. The patient has a temperature, foul-smelling breath and may feel quite ill. Therefore drugs with anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory effects may be useful for treatment of CHT. Ayurveda, as well as recent experimental results indicate the ingredients of a poly-herbo-mineral formulation KR as having anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, and immunomodulatory effects.

Biologically active substances in liquorice root include glycyrrhizic acid (GL) and its aglycone (GA), phenolic compounds, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, lipids, sterine, etc. Many researchers have suggested that the effects on the production of interferon (IFN) and Th2 cytokines might be one of the mechanisms involved in the anti-infective process. Recently, glycyrrhizin has been found to be active in inhibiting replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-associated virus (FFM-1 and FFM-2) and also H5N1 influenza A virus-infected cells. GL is also reported to have modulatory effects on the complement system. Reports indicate that GL blocks C5 or a more distal stage of the complement cascade, suggesting that it might have a role in preventing tissue injury not only in chronic hepatitis, but also in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Chemical modification of GL and GA has been tried, and a significant improvement in anti-inflammatory, antiallergic, and antiulcer activities was observed. These observations indicate immune-modulating and biological response modifier activities associated with GL. <italic>Tinospora cordifolia</italic> (TC) is known for its immunomodulatory and cytoprotective activities Quaternary alkaloids and biotherapeutic diterpene glucosides of TC (syringin, cordiol, cordioside, and coriofolioside) showed an immunopotentiating activity.

TC also inhibits C3 convertase of the classical complement pathway. Research on polysaccharide (&#x003b1;-<sc>d</sc>-glucan) derived from TC shows the activation of nuclear killer (NK) cells, complement system, and Th1 pathway cytokines, coupled with low nitric oxide synthesis.<xref rid="bib43" ref-type="bibr"><sup>43</sup></xref> Aswagandha has shown promising immunomodulatory effect in inflammatory experimental models.<xref rid="bib44" ref-type="bibr"><sup>44</sup></xref> Sunthi (<italic>Zingiber officinalis</italic>) has anti-inflammatory property which inhibits LPS-induced NF-&#x003ba;B activation by preventing degradation of the I&#x003ba;B-&#x003b1;, as well as the phosphorylation of ERK1/2, SAPK/JNK, and p38 MAPKs which were associated with a decrease in the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and cyclooxyenase-2 (COX-2).<xref rid="bib45" ref-type="bibr"><sup>45</sup></xref> Vacha (<italic>Acorus calamus</italic>) is reported for its inhibitory effect on mast cell-dependent anaphylactic reactions in allergic reactions of the respiratory tract.<xref rid="bib46" ref-type="bibr"><sup>46</sup></xref> Amla (<italic>Phyllanthus emblica</italic>) has been reported to suppress the expression of LPS-induced pro-inflammatory genes (COX-2, iNOS, TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-16, and IL-6) in RAW 264.7 murine macrophage cells in a dose-dependent manner.<xref rid="bib47" ref-type="bibr"><sup>47</sup></xref> Honey is known to enhance the action of these medicines, and has a potential immunomodulatory effect.<xref rid="bib48" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>, <xref rid="bib49" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>, <xref rid="bib50" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>, <xref rid="bib51" ref-type="bibr">51</xref></p></sec><sec id="sec5"><label>5</label><title>Conclusion</title><p>Thus the poly-herbo-mineral formulation KR has a combined mechanism of action on tonsillitis by reducing the number of attacks.
