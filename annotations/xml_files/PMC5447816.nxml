However, this has not been reported for microsurgery. Our study objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of bench model hands-on learning in acquiring microsuturing skills. The secondary objective was to evaluate the aptitude for microsurgery based on personality assessment. Eighty-six medical students comprising 62 men and 24 women were randomly assigned to either 20 min of hands-on learning with a bench model simulator or 20 min of video-learning using an instructional video. They then practiced microsuturing for 40 min. Each student then made three knots, and the time to complete the task was recorded. The final products were scored by two independent graders in a blind fashion. All participants then took a personality test, and their microsuture test scores and the time to complete the task were compared. The time to complete the task was significantly shorter in the simulator group than in the video-learning group. The final product scores tended to be higher with simulator-learning than with video-learning, but the difference was not significant. Students with high &#x0201c;extraversion&#x0201d; scores on the personality inventory took a shorter time to complete the suturing test. Simulator-learning was more effective for microsurgery training than video instruction, especially in understanding the procedure. There was a weak association between personality traits and microsurgery skill.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>microsurgery</kwd><kwd>training</kwd><kwd>personality</kwd><kwd>aptitude</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microsurgical skill is essential for neurosurgeons. However, acquiring microsurgical skills is challenging and time consuming. This may keep novices away from microsurgery. Various training methods have been previously reported.<sup><xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3)</xref></sup> In Japan, repetitive suturing of gauze fibers with 10-0 nylon using a desk-type microscope is a common microsurgery training method used to learn the precise movements required for microvascular anastomosis.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref></sup> However, holding the 10-0 nylon and needle is too difficult for novices in first practice. An introductory method of microsurgical training for novices is thus required. A previous study reported that the bench model of hands-on learning was more effective than traditional didactic practice at the early stages of surgical training.<sup><xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5)</xref></sup> In that study, Matsumoto et al. found that hands-on learning using a simple bench model simulator of complex skills, such as stone extraction by ureteroscopy, was more effective than didactic instruction.</p><p>We hypothesized that the results would be similar during the early stages of microsurgery training. In other words, hands-on learning with simple and large-scale simulators would be a more effective introduction to microsurgery training than traditional video-learning. Our main objective in this study was to compare the acquisition of basic microsurgical skills in medical students who learned using a simple large-scale bench model simulator to that of medical students who learned using an instructional video only.</p><p>Acquiring microsurgical skills is difficult, and medical students who are interested in microsurgery may wonder whether they have an aptitude for microsurgery. Knowledge regarding the specific skills required to more easily succeed at microsurgery would help these students to choose their subspecialty. The relationships between specific personality traits and surgery have previously been studied.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9)</xref></sup> Since we assume that microsurgical skill is related to personality, our secondary objective was to determine the relationship between personality and acquisition of microsurgical skills.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subjects"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifth-year medical students at the Nagoya University School of Medicine participated in this study. As we did not want the participants to have any prior microsurgery experience, we recruited students and not residents. Medical students with prior microsurgery training were excluded. The Nagoya University School of Medicine Institutional Review Board approved this study (IRB No. 2015-0084). All of the students provided written informed consent before they participated in this study. The students were divided into two groups by simple randomization.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials"><title>Materials</title><p>Students used Leica S6E desk-type microscopes for practice (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wetzlar, Germany). The magnification of the microscope was fixed at 12.6&#x000d7; (2.0 &#x000d7; 10 &#x000d7; 0.63) throughout the training. Micro-scissors (PS-1510, Muranaka Med, Japan) and micro-forceps (BONIMED, Muranaka Med, Japan) were used. Commercially available nonsterile 10-0 nylon (Bear Medic, Ibaragi, Japan) was used for microsuturing, and 5-0 nylon (Diadem, Ibaragi, Japan) and surgical forceps (McIndoe Forceps DA111S1, YDM Corporation, Saitama, Japan) were used for suturing on the simulator. The suturing simulator was made at the medical school. Woolen yarn sleds and ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) sheets were attached to the wooden board (20 &#x000d7; 15 cm) of the simulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>We developed a system for grading the microsutures in this study. The Nagoya University Micro Suturing Assessment System (NUMSAS, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2</xref>) includes four components used to assess the quality of knots, i.e., shape of the knot, fixation of the knot, length of thread, and knot interval. These components are scored on a five-point Likert scale. There are many grading systems used to evaluate microsurgical technique.<sup><xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14)</xref></sup> The University of Western Ontario Microsurgical Skills Acquisition/Assessment instrument (UWOMSA) includes not only a microvascular anastomosis assessment, but also a microsuturing assessment.<sup><xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11)</xref></sup> We modified the knot-tying assessment of the UWOMSA to develop the NUMSAS.</p><p>The NEO-five-factor inventory (FFI) is a widely used personality test used to evaluate five basic personality characteristics. These characteristics are neuroticism (N), extraversion (E), openness (O), agreeableness (A), and conscientiousness (C). This test is based on the five-factor theory.<sup><xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15)</xref></sup> The NEO-FFI has been translated into Japanese and has been validated.<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16)</xref></sup> The following are simple descriptions for each personality trait.<sup><xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17)</xref></sup>

Students in the video-learning group watched a 10-min instructional video that explained the procedure used to microsuture gauze fiber twice. Subsequently, these students practiced microsuturing with the aid of a microscope for 40 min. They practiced suturing adjacent gauze fibers with 10-0 nylon, tied three knots, and cut the thread using micro-scissors.</p><p>The simulator-learning group practiced suturing for 20 min. They sutured adjacent woolen yarn threads on the simulator using two surgical forceps and 5-0 nylon. After completing 20 min of simulator learning, these students practiced microsuturing for 40 min using a microscope similar to that used in the video-learning group. During practice, all students were free to ask questions from the expert instructor.</p><p>After 40 min of practice, the students were tested by stitching adjacent gauze fibers and tying three knots. The test was repeated three times and the time required to complete the test was recorded. Students who could not finish the procedure in 60 min were considered to have passed the time limit and were allowed to stop taking the test at any time. Two independent expert neurosurgeons assessed the quality of the knots in a blinded fashion and graded the final products using the NUMSAS. After the knot-tying test, we conducted the NEO-FFI to assess the relationship between surgical skill and personality.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The Wilcoxon rank sum test was used to compare the NUMSAS scores of the video and simulator groups. The NUMSAS score considered was the average score from the two independent graders.

The time to complete for students who could not complete the procedure within 60 min or those who gave up on the procedure before completing it was recorded as 3,600 s. Univariate and multivariate linear regression analyses were also used to evaluate the relationship between NEO-FFI and NUMSAS scores.

Three students who had taken a microsurgery course were excluded. The study thus included 86 fifth-year medical students. The mean age of the participants was 24.19 &#x000b1; 3.77 years. Sixty-two of the subjects were men and 24 were women (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>). Forty-five students were assigned to the video-learning group and 41 students were assigned to the simulator-learning group. Two men assigned to the video-learning group gave up during the final test at the half-way point due to the difficulty of the test. These students&#x02019; time to finish was recorded as 3,600 s.

Using the T score of the NEO-FFI manual,<sup><xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17)</xref></sup> we stratified the students into five groups: very high score (T &#x02265; 66 points), high score (65 &#x02265; T &#x02265; 56), average score (55 &#x02265; T &#x02265; 45), low score (44 &#x02265; T &#x02265; 35), and very low score (34 &#x02265; T). The mean score of the N trait was 46.70 &#x000b1; 11.08 points, while it was 49.03 &#x000b1; 10.45 for E, 48.36 &#x000b1; 11.93 for O, 49.73 &#x000b1; 11.08 for A, and 53.45 &#x000b1; 11.07 for C.

Multiple regression analysis also revealed that women tended to have higher NUMSAS scores than men. However, this difference was not significant (estimated regression coefficient = 2.88, <italic>P =</italic> 0.0857).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Acquiring microsurgical skill is challenging and the existing training methods are too difficult novices. Better methods for introductory microsurgical training are needed. We evaluated the effectiveness of a bench model simulator and compared it to that of traditional video-learning for medical students. A secondary objective was to identify an aptitude for microsurgery using a personality test. The learned skill was completed in a significantly shorter time with simulator-learning than with video-learning. The only difference in NUMSAS scores between the two different training groups was that for suture length, with better scores in the simulator group. Multiple regression analysis revealed that women tended to have higher NUMSAS scores than men. However, this difference was not significant.</p><p>When evaluating the relationships between personality traits and time to complete the suturing test, we found that relatively high E scores were associated with significantly faster suturing when compared to average scores.</p><p>The simple large-scale bench model makes it easier to grasp the suturing technique using a microscope. Practice with hand motion is likely to be more effective for developing an understanding of the procedure than practice without hand motion. However, the simulator did not seem to affect the quality of the final knots. It may be difficult for novices to produce high-quality knots.<sup><xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2)</xref></sup></p><p>Our results indicate that hands-on practice with a suturing simulator may be an effective introduction for microsuturing practice under a desk-type microscope.<sup><xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4)</xref></sup> Novices or young trainees who cannot increase their microsuturing speed should try suturing using simulator learning, as they might then be able to perform microsuturing smoothly. The suturing simulator would also be effective as a component in the microsurgery training course for novices. The efficacy of the microsurgery training course has been reported.<sup><xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18)</xref></sup> However, time to practice in the training course is usually limited. As far as we know, a microsurgery training course using a simulator has never been reported. We believe that hands-on simulator learning as a part of a microsurgery training course would be a good introduction for novices and would enable them to have a steeper learning curve and more smoothly manage the course.</p><p>We found that women tended to have higher final products test scores, although this difference was not statistically significant. Our results differ from those of previous reports, as some studies have reported higher dexterity in men.<sup><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21)</xref></sup> However, most previous articles have focused on laparoscopic surgery, where visual-spatial perception, perceptual ability, and psychomotor skills have significant influence on performance.<sup><xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24)</xref></sup> Microsurgery requires different abilities than laparoscopic surgery. For example, precise movements without tremor are required. It has been reported that women have better hand stability and less tremor than men.<sup><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26)</xref></sup> In contrast to results from studies of laparoscopy, women participating in this study seemed to be better than men in learning microsurgery skills.</p><p>Analysis of the relationship between personality traits and surgical skill revealed that high extraversion was associated with shorter than average suture completion times. Previous studies have reported that surgeons have higher extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness scores than the general population, although they have lower agreeableness scores.<sup><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27)</xref></sup> Others have also reported significantly higher extraversion and conscientiousness scores and lower neuroticism and agreeableness scores.<sup><xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6)</xref></sup> Unlike previous studies, we did not find a correlation between personality traits scores and time to complete the learning test, except for a correlation with extraversion. These differences in results may be explained by the fact that the previous studies had recruited surgeons and not medical students. A previous study also suggests that the surgeons have higher extraversion, openness, and conscientiousness scores, and lower agreeableness during their surgical residency.<sup><xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7)</xref></sup> This is in line with other reports of personality change throughout the life span of surgeons.<sup><xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28)</xref></sup> Our results indicate that students with higher extraversion scores already have the &#x0201c;quick hands&#x0201d; needed for microsurgery. We assume that surgeons acquire higher emotional stability, openness, conscientiousness, and lower agreeableness through their surgical residency and that higher extraversion is endowed by nature.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations</title><p>We did not detect any significant differences between NUMSAS scores, except for length. We thus presume that our grading system might not be objective. In fact, both graders complained that it was difficult to objectively assess the shapes of the knots. In addition, the magnifications of the microscopes used might not have been sufficient to determine whether the knot was square. To objectively assess the quality of the procedure, a motion-tracking system would be helpful, although it is very expensive.<sup><xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32)</xref></sup> The existing grading system<sup><xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30)</xref></sup> was not expensive, but it was somewhat subjective.<sup><xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32)</xref></sup> The grading system was time consuming.<sup><xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32)</xref></sup> Therefore, a more efficient and precise grading system is needed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Simulator-learning was more effective in introducing microsurgical training than traditional video instruction. Thus, this type of learning would increase the effectiveness of the training curriculum for microsurgery novices. Women tended to have final products with higher quality than those produced by men, although this difference was not significant. We found some relationships between personality traits and microsurgery skill. However, the results are not yet sufficiently clear to guide medical students in the choice of their subspecialty. Further research is required to clarify the aptitude for microsurgery and help medical students who are interested in its practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank all of the students of Nagoya University School of Medicine.</p><p>Funding: This study was supported by the internal research foundation of the Department of Neurosurgery, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine.</p></ack><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Conflicts of Interest Disclosure</bold></p><p>There is no conflict of interest concerning this study.
