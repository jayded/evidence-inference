Owing to a unique &#x0201c;Asian Indian Phenotype,&#x0201d; Indians develop diabetes a decade earlier and have an earlier onset of complications than Western populations. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate more effective treatment strategies at an earlier stage of disease progression, such as initial combination therapy, in Indian patients. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of initial combination therapy with linagliptin plus metformin in comparison to linagliptin or metformin monotherapy in Indian patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This is a subgroup analysis of Indian patients who participated in a Phase III, 24-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled, trial. Overall, 249 Indian patients were randomized to one of six treatment arms (Two free combination therapy arms: Linagliptin 2.5 mg twice daily [bid] + either low [500 mg, <italic>n</italic> = 36] or high [1000 mg, <italic>n</italic> = 44] dose metformin bid and four monotherapy arms: Linagliptin 5 mg once daily [qd, <italic>n</italic> = 40], metformin 500 mg [<italic>n</italic> = 49] or 1000 mg bid [<italic>n</italic> = 45], or placebo [<italic>n</italic> = 23]).</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The placebo-corrected mean change in glycated hemoglobin from baseline (8.9%) to week 24 was &#x02212;1.83% for linagliptin + metformin 1000 mg bid; &#x02212;1.46% for linagliptin + metformin 500 mg bid; &#x02212;1.30% for metformin 1000 mg bid; &#x02212;1.00% for metformin 500 mg bid; and &#x02212;0.77% for linagliptin 5 mg qd. None of the patients in the combination therapy arms had hypoglycemia, whereas there was one event in the metformin 1000 mg bid arm. Rates of adverse event were similar across various treatments.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>In this subgroup analysis of Indian patients, initial combination therapy with linagliptin + metformin was more efficacious in improving glycemic control than the monotherapy arms, with a comparable tolerability profile.

This prevalence is projected to reach nearly 109.0 million by 2035.[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Indians are characterized by the presence of an &#x0201c;Asian Indian Phenotype&#x0201d; that is associated with an earlier age of onset of diabetes and its complications.[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]</p><p>Diabetes has been traditionally managed using a stepwise approach involving the initiation of lifestyle modifications (for example, nutritional interventions and exercise), followed by the addition of oral antidiabetes drugs (OAD) such as metformin monotherapy if the glycated hemoglobin A<sub>1c</sub> (HbA<sub>1c</sub>) level remains above the target of 7.0% as recommended by the American Diabetes Association/European Association for the Study of Diabetes guidelines.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Despite initial monotherapy, majority of patients fail to achieve glycemic goals over time and may require a combination therapy to maintain their HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels within the target range.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]</p><p>The 2013 American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists guidelines recommends initial combination therapy for patients who present with HbA<sub>1c</sub> &#x0003e;7.5% or whose glycemic goal is not reached with metformin alone.[<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] An optimal initial combination therapy would be one having drugs that have complementary mechanisms of action thereby targeting different core pathophysiologies of T2DM, such as insulin resistance and loss of pancreatic &#x003b2;-cell function.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Recent study findings by Williams-Herman <italic>et al</italic>. indicates that initial combination treatment may produce larger improvements in &#x003b2;-cell function when compared with the respective monotherapies.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] Due to their complementary mechanisms of action, a combination of metformin with a dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 inhibitor would appear to meet these requirements.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] Therefore, the aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the new combination of linagliptin and metformin in Indian patients with T2DM.</p><p>Linagliptin is a xanthine-based, nonpeptidomimetic, selective DPP-4 inhibitor possessing a unique pharmacological profile compared with other available DPP-4 inhibitors. Following oral administration, majority of linagliptin is eliminated unchanged via the hepatic/biliary route unlike other DPP-4 inhibitors, which are excreted primarily via the renal route. Therefore, linagliptin requires no dosage adjustment in T2DM patients based on their renal or hepatic function.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Clinical trials with linagliptin have established its efficacy in terms of decreasing HbA<sub>1c</sub> levels in T2DM patients while maintaining safety and tolerability profile similar to placebo.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>The results of a recent 24-week Phase III study which assessed the initial combination therapy of linagliptin plus metformin showed its superiority over metformin monotherapy in terms of the improvement in glycemic control, with a similar safety and tolerability profile, and no weight gain and a relatively low risk of hypoglycemia.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] Nearly 30% of patients in this study were from India.

However, this combination suffers from certain drawbacks such as an increased risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and potential cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, this initial combination therapy does not appear to be an attractive option because of the possibility of sulfonylureas causing depletion of &#x003b2;-cell insulin stores and induction of &#x003b2;-cell apoptosis.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Data from the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study have indicated that intensive treatment of newly diagnosed T2DM patients can lead to long-term benefits including decreased microvascular complications and cardiovascular events.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>In this subgroup analysis of Indian patients with T2DM from a randomized Phase III trial, initial combination therapy with linagliptin plus metformin led to a greater improvement in glycemic control than either linagliptin or metformin monotherapy. After 24 weeks of treatment, the mean reduction in HbA<sub>1c</sub> in the linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 1000 mg group was shown to be &#x02212;1.83% (placebo-corrected value).</p><p>The time course and the extent of HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction in Indian patients were shown to be similar to that seen in the overall population included in the global trial. In the overall population, the placebo-corrected mean HbA<sub>1c</sub> changes from baseline at 24 weeks for the different arms were &#x02212;0.76% for metformin 500 mg, &#x02212;1.15% for metformin 1000 mg, &#x02212;0.56% for linagliptin 5 mg, &#x02212;1.35% for linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 500 mg, and &#x02212;1.7% for linagliptin 2.5 mg + metformin 1000 mg. The change in FPG levels in each arm was also consistent between the Indian subgroup of patients and the overall trial population.[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>The risk of AEs, especially hypoglycemia, is one of the major concerns associated with combination pharmacotherapy in T2DM. Data from several clinical trials indicate that the linagliptin, either as monotherapy or in combination with other OADs, has good tolerability, with neutral or minimal effects on bodyweight and a very low incidence of hypoglycemia.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In the analysis reported here, the majority of AEs were shown to be of a mild or moderate intensity. Discontinuation rates due to AEs were low and similar across the active treatment groups (2.0&#x02013;6.1%).

This single-arm, retrospective, observational analysis conducted by Chatterjee and Chatterjee, in Kolkata, India showed significant HbA<sub>1c</sub> reduction with the combination of metformin (500 mg) and vildagliptin (50 mg) given once or twice daily (1.4% and 1.9%, respectively) in 280 diabetic patients (average duration of follow-up was 16.8 months).[<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>C<sc>ONCLUSION</sc></title><p>In this Indian subgroup analysis, which included patients who were treatment na&#x000ef;ve and patients who received prior treatment with sulfonylureas or metformin as monotherapy, all active treatments lowered HbA<sub>1c</sub> and FPG levels over time, with the combination therapies showing greater efficacy than the monotherapies. The addition of linagliptin to metformin was not associated with an increase in AEs, which occurred with low frequency.
