Randomisation, conducted by an independent statistician, was computer-generated and was stratified by geographical region and prior biologic use (with prior biologic use capped at 40% of study population) for RA. The primary hypothesis, that there were no clinically meaningful differences between the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups, was tested by comparing the 2-sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of the RR of ACR20 at week 24 between ABP 501 and adalimumab to the equivalence margin of (0.738, 1.355). The rationale for the equivalence margin was based on considerations in the draft US FDA Non-inferiority Clinical Trials Guidance for Industry.<xref rid="R28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> The equivalence margin of 0.738, 1/0.738=1.355 for the RR of ACR20 responses was chosen based on a published relevant adequate and well-controlled trial<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> and was expected to preserve 50% of the estimated 80% upper confidence bound of the treatment effect of the reference product compared with placebo. The 90%&#x02009;CI for RR was estimated using a&#x000a0;generalised linear model adjusted for the stratification factors. All other efficacy endpoints, including RD of ACR20, were analysed descriptively. For DAS28-CRP, treatment differences across time&#x000a0;points for change from baseline in DAS28-CRP were evaluated using a mixed model for repeated-measures analysis, with stratification variables, visit, treatment group, treatment-by-visit interactions and baseline DAS28-CRP included in the model. For ACR50 and ACR70, treatment differences were estimated using the same model as described above for ACR20. Analyses of the RDs for ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 between ABP 501 and adalimumab were descriptive in nature and their corresponding 90% CIs were estimated using the generalised linear model adjusted for stratification factors. For the primary analysis based on the full analysis set, missing values were imputed using the last observation carried forward method. As sensitivity analyses, efficacy endpoints were also analysed for the per-protocol analysis set, which included patients who completed the treatment period and did not have a protocol violation, based on observed cases. In addition, for binary endpoints, such as ACR20, another imputation was performed for sensitivity in which patients with a missing binary response at a certain visit were imputed as non-responders.</p><p>All safety data were analysed using the safety analysis set (all randomised patients who received&#x000a0;&#x02265;1&#x02009;dose of IP) based on patients&#x02019; actual treatment received.

For regulatory review, demonstration that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the proposed biosimilar and its reference product is necessary. FDA guidance on the development and approval of biosimilars requires that a stepwise, totality-of-evidence-based approach be used to generate data in support of biosimilarity and to evaluate any residual uncertainty.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Likewise, the EMA requires that biosimilars show similarity to the reference product in pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, clinical efficacy and safety and that a risk management/pharmacovigilance plan is adopted in accordance with EU legislation.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Analytical comparison has shown that ABP 501 and adalimumab are highly similar molecules with respect to physicochemical properties<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and biological activity.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Pharmacokinetic equivalence of ABP 501 to adalimumab was also demonstrated in a phase I, single-dose study conducted in healthy adults.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Results from an additional clinical trial have shown that clinical efficacy and safety profiles for ABP 501 are similar to those of adalimumab in 350 patients with moderate to severe psoriasis (NCT01970488), which adds to the overall demonstration of similarity between the biosimilar and reference product.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref></p><p>Results from this study indicate that ABP 501 is equivalent in efficacy to the reference product, adalimumab, in patients with RA. Similar efficacy results were observed for ABP 501 and adalimumab for ACR20 (primary endpoint), ACR50 and ACR70 (secondary endpoints). The mean changes from baseline in DAS28-CRP results were also similar between groups at all study time&#x000a0;points.</p><p>The clinical safety results from this study indicate that ABP&#x000a0;501 and adalimumab have similar safety profiles. No new safety signals were detected in this study compared with other adalimumab clinical trials in patients with RA.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Hypersensitivity reactions were reported infrequently and occurred at a generally similar frequency in both treatment groups.</p><p>Since biosimilars are not identical molecules, the determination of immunogenicity by ADA formation is a major part of the registration programme for approval.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> In the current study, a highly sensitive and drug tolerant electrochemiluminescent assay was used to assess ADA status.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In pivotal trials of adalimumab in RA, ADA status had been determined by ELISA assays that did not allow for detection of ADAs&#x000a0;in the presence of drug and that measured ADA levels that were much lower than those reported in this trial.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Even though the levels of ADAs&#x000a0;detected were higher due to a more sensitive assay than those reported from historical pivotal trials of adalimumab, the percentages of patients who tested positive for binding and neutralising antibodies in this trial were similar between the ABP 501 and adalimumab groups throughout the study. In a phase I study in which the relationship between pharmacokinetics and ADA status was assessed in healthy subjects receiving ABP 501 or adalimumab, results showed that overall exposure (area under the curve (AUC)) was approximately 20%&#x02013;30%&#x02009;lower in subjects who were ADA positive versus those who were ADA negative.<xref rid="R24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Similarly, the elimination half&#x000a0;lives (t<sub>1/2</sub>) for ADA positive subjects were shorter (6&#x02013;7 days) than patients who were ADA negative (12&#x02013;15 days). This inverse correlation between ADA levels and serum concentrations of TNF&#x003b1; inhibitors has been previously shown in many studies and has been associated with decreased clinical efficacy.<xref rid="R30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref> Patients who were symptomatic seronegative were not included in this study as they may be misdiagnosed as having RA and would introduce more heterogeneity within the population. Additionally, as biosimilarity is proven via a totality-of-evidence-based approach, the demonstration of similarity between ABP 501 and adalimumab from analytical, functional, pharmacokinetic and clinical perspectives leaves no residual uncertainty that ABP 501 will behave differently in patients who were seronegative. In the present trial, the clinical responses for both ABP 501 and adalimumab were comparable to previously reported results suggesting that the majority of the antibodies detected in these patients may have little or no clinical relevance.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> Further, the percentage of patients who achieved an ACR20 response by ADA status indicates no change in efficacy throughout the study for either treatment group, regardless of ADA status.</p><p>Limitations of this study include the 6-month trial design; however, an open-label extension of this study, up to 72 weeks (NCT02114931), is on-going and will provide additional long-term safety and efficacy data for ABP 501 in patients with moderate to severe RA. Moreover, 52-week results from the previously mentioned trial in patients with psoriasis will also provide insights into the long-term immunogenicity and safety profile of ABP 501. Regulatory guidelines for biosimilars do not require monitoring of radiographic progression. While this may be an area of interest, detecting any clinically meaningful differences in radiographic progression would be challenging via studies designed to compare two active treatment groups.</p><p>Data from this study indicate that the clinical efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of ABP 501 are similar to that of adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe RA. Additionally, analytical, biofunctional and pharmacokinetic properties of ABP&#x000a0;501 have previously been shown to be highly similar to those of adalimumab.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22&#x02013;24</xref> Taken together, these data contribute to the totality-of-evidence-based requirements to demonstrate that ABP 501 is similar to adalimumab. The FDA has, thus, approved ABP 501 for use as a biosimilar to adalimumab,<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> making it a valuable new therapeutic option for the treatment of moderate to severe RA.</p><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SP3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1136/annrheumdis-2016-210459.supp3</object-id><caption><title>Supplementary data</title></caption><p><inline-supplementary-material id="ss3" xlink:href="annrheumdis-2016-210459supp003.doc" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="msword" content-type="local-data"/></p></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><p>The authors would like to thank all investigators and patients who participated in the study.
