</p><p>Comparisons with healthy people living at sea level, climbers and athletes to determine the effects of high altitude are reported, but there is no correlation with the bone structure described.</p><p>Because of increased life expectancy and the increasingly frequent appearance of degenerative processes of the joints, including the hips, and the need for arthroplasty replacement of these joints, we noticed that people who were born and raised at altitude have a smaller femoral canal as compared to other regions at low altitude or sea level.</p><p>Our goal is to confirm the hypothesis that the size of the proximal femoral canal is lower in this population. </p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>This is a prospective study of individuals living at altitude regions, at sea level or low-altitude regions of both genders aged between 20 and 60 years old without systemic bone diseases or at the hip level. The study was approved by the Institutional Ethics Committee and the patients signed a Free and Informed Consent Term.</p><p>We considered altitude cities those located at more than 800 meters above sea level and low altitude cities those located at maximum 150 meters in relation to sea level.</p><p>We divided the sample into two groups: Group A: 99 patients who were born and raised at altitude regions Group B: 70 patients who were born and raised at sea level or at low altitudes.</p><p>We applied a questionnaire investigating gender, age, dominant hand, race, ancestry, hometown, city where the individual was raised up to 21 years old and questions on the exclusion criteria.</p><p>We excluded from the study cases without full documentation (data and image tests), patients who did not fit into the age range, who had congenital disease in the proximal femur, high body mass index (BMI), rheumatic diseases, previous fracture at the proximal femur bone, metabolic disorders or that have undergone any prior procedure on the hip. All patients also had an adequate calcium intake and were engaged in regular physical activity.</p><p>All patients underwent panoramic digital radiographs of the pelvis using the following criteria: patient in supine position, radius of about 70 cm high, directed to the midline, just above the pubic symphysis, with feet turned inward about 15 to 20 degrees, the middle portion of the sacrococcygeal junction located in the same vertical axis of the symphysis, 2 to 5 cm distally from it; the trochanters not being superimposed to the femoral necks and the smaller trochanter being visible, but not protruding.</p><p>We evaluated the radiographs of the pelvis of the two groups with the following measures:</p><p>First measure: to the small trochanter level (measure of the lateral cortex, medial cortical and size of the femoral canal).</p><p>Second measure: 5 cm below the lesser trochanter (measure of the lateral cortex, medial cortical and size of the femoral canal).</p><p>Third measure: 10 cm below the lesser trochanter (measure of the lateral cortex, medial cortical and size of the femoral canal).</p><p>All measurements were evaluated by the same observers.

</p><p>Statistical Analysis</p><p>We used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov normality test, with the PROC UNIVARIATE NORMAL SAS software (SAS Institute, 1999) for statistical evaluation of continuous variables. The comparison between means of the populations at different altitudes was performed using the Student t-test.</p><p>The decision on t-tests was determined from the variance homogeneity test (F test). We used the exact t-test when the variances were homogeneous. In non-homogeneous cases, we adopted the approximate t-test.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>We evaluated 169 patients, of these, 99 patients (58.58%) belong to municipalities at altitudes and 70 patients (41.42%) to municipalities at the sea level.</p><p>Of the 99 patients in municipalities at altitude, 61.62% (61 patients) were female and 38.38% (38 patients) were male. Of the 70 cases at sea level 44.3% (31 patients) were female and 55.7% (39 patients) were male. There was no statistically significant difference between genders comparing the femoral canal, but in male patients, the lateral and medial cortical has always been thicker.

</p><p>Patients at altitudes were aged between 20 and 60 years old. Patients of municipalities located at sea level were aged 22 to 60 years old. For both environments (altitude and sea level), more than 70% of patients were between 30 and 59 years old, with approximately 30% of them belonging to the age group 30-39 years old.</p><p>Right handed were 95.27% (n=161) of the sample, whereas patients with left dominant side contributed with only 4.73% (n=8) of the sample, and there was no statistically significant difference in the thickness of the femoral canal regarding the dominant side.</p><p>As the contribution of ancestries to the sample, we observed that European, Latin, African, mixed descent and others corresponded to 129 (76.33%), 22 (13.01%), 9 (5.33%), 5 (2.96%) and 4 (2.37%) of patients, respectively. Comparing the population ancestries, we noticed that patients of African origin have significantly thicker femoral canal than patients from other origins.
