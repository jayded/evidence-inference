As vitamin D deficiency has been linked to numerous diseases, understanding how genetic variation contributes to vitamin D dose-response is important for personalized vitamin D treatment and cost-effective disease prevention. To identify genetic variants responsible for vitamin D status and dose-response, we performed two vitamin D3 and calcium clinical supplementation trials in 2,207 postmenopausal Caucasian women. We examined the association of 291 SNPs with baseline serum 25(OH)D levels and 25(OH)D dose-response. Five SNPs, rs10500804 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;4.93&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), rs2060793 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.63&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), rs10741657 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.49&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), rs10766197 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.05&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) and rs11023380 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.67&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>) in the CYP2R1 gene, as well as 6 SNPs, rs4588 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;7.86&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;7</sup>), rs2298850 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.94&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), rs1155563 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;6.39&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;6</sup>), rs705119 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.80&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;5</sup>), rs705120 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.08&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) and rs222040 (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.59&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>) in the GC gene were associated with baseline serum 25(OH)D levels.

Based on results from our previous population-based study of vitamin D status in postmenopausal women in Eastern Nebraska, we extrapolate that more than 60% of elderly female North Americans may have serum 25(OH)D concentrations below 75&#x02009;nmol/L<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>Vitamin D, an essential nutrient, is a pro-steroid hormone. Whether obtained through diet, supplement, or produced in the skin, vitamin D is metabolized in the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] by the enzyme 25-hydroxylase. 25(OH)D is further hydroxylated to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D [1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D]. The broad function of vitamin D is through 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D, a hormone that regulates ~1000 genes in the human genome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Optimal local (intracellular) synthesis of 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D is dependent on optimal concentrations of serum 25(OH)D. Therefore, achieving and maintaining an optimal serum 25(OH)D level is essential for tissues to efficiently synthesize hormone 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D for overall body health<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref>.</p><p>Currently, vitamin D supplementation is the best way to achieve adequate serum vitamin D levels<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>. There are two types of vitamin D supplements available: vitamin D2 and D3. Vitamin D3 supplementation is widely recommended by clinicians for the prevention and treatment of bone disease. Vitamin D along with Calcium supplementation has been shown to decrease fracture risk in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis as well as older men<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref>.

However, the change in serum vitamin D in response to a given dose of vitamin D supplementation varies widely among individuals.

Genome wide association studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> have demonstrated that serum vitamin D levels are influenced by genotype, however, few studies have examined the impact of genetic variation in response to vitamin D supplementation.

To the best of our knowledge, no other genes have yet been found to modify the response to vitamin D supplementation. Identification of the genetic variants responsible for the wide variation in vitamin D status and vitamin D dose-response is important for development of personalized vitamin D treatment plans and cost-effective disease prevention protocols in osteoporosis and other diseases<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Based on data from two completed vitamin D clinical trials, we examined the effect of polymorphisms in 15 candidate genes on vitamin D dose-response variation in postmenopausal women. The 15 genes included in our study were carefully selected based on their functional importance for vitamin D metabolism, transportation, and signaling pathways. The association of these candidate genes to baseline serum 25(OH)D was also assessed.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Results</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>General characteristics of 2,207 subjects in the CaMEWS and D&#x00026;Cancer study</title><p>A total of 2,207 subjects with complete data were included in the genetic association analysis of baseline serum 25(OH)D variation.

Our data suggest that CYP2R1 and GC gene polymorphisms are associated with baseline serum 25(OH)D and that SNP rs11185644 polymorphisms have a statistically significant association with vitamin D dose response. These findings confirm what other studies have demonstrated with regards to the effects of GC and CYP2R1 on baseline serum 25(OH)D; however, we were not able to replicate any association between these genes and vitamin D dose response. Additionally, our study is the first to implicate the potential effect of SNP rs11185644 on vitamin D dose response.</p><p>CYP2R1, a member of the CYP2 family, encodes cytochrome p4502R1. Previous studies have shown that the CYP2R1 gene is associated with several vitamin D related diseases including type 1 diabetes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref>, polycystic ovary syndrome<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>, and ovarian cancer<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref>. As a microsomal vitamin D 25-hydroxylase in humans, cytochrome P450 2R1 converts vitamin D into 25(OH)D. Given that it is responsible for 25(OH)D productions from a biological precursor, it is very plausible for mutations in this gene to contribute to variations in baseline serum 25(OH)D, and indeed this has been shown to be the case. An inherited transition mutation in exon 2 of CYP2R1 has been demonstrated to eliminate its 25-hydroxylase activity and was associated with low circulating levels of 25(OH)D and classic symptoms of vitamin D deficiency<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref>. SNPs in CYP2R1 were previously reported to be associated with serum vitamin D levels in two large genome - wide association studies (GWAS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> in Caucasian cohorts as well as several candidate gene studies, including one of 1204 postmenopausal women of European descent<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>. Our study demonstrates a statistically significant association of serum 25(OH)D with five SNPs in the CYP2R1 gene (rs2060793, rs10500804, rs11023380, rs10741657, rs10766197) and each of these has been replicated by other studies. Specifically, rs2060793, rs10500804 and rs11023380 were replicated by Engleman&#x02019;s candidate gene study in a summer phlebotomy group<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>; rs2060793 was also identified in Ahn&#x02019;s GWAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b32">32</xref> of 4,501 persons of European ancestry (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;17</sup>); rs10741657 was included in Wang&#x02019;s GWAS<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref> of 30,000 individuals of European descent (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;3.3&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;20</sup>). Lastly, rs10766197&#x02019;s association with serum 25(OH)D levels was demonstrated in healthy Danish children and adults<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>.</p><p>GC, the vitamin D binding protein gene, encodes DBP, a 52&#x02013;59&#x02009;kDA protein synthesized in the liver that binds and transports vitamin D and its metabolites (including 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub> D)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref>.

Multiple studies have reported that several nonsynonymous SNPs in this gene are associated with 25(OH)D concentrations<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b50">50</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. Nonsynonymous SNPs rs4588 (Thr&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Lys) and rs7041 (Asp&#x02009;&#x02192;&#x02009;Glu) are the most common <italic>GC</italic> variants<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b51">51</xref>. In Engelman&#x02019;s study<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, rs4588 was significantly associated with 25(OH)D with an uncorrected <italic>P</italic> value of less than 0.001 (Bonferroni-corrected significance of a/n of SNPs tested&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.05/29&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.0017). Our data strongly replicates this association (Bonferroni single-step adjusted <italic>P</italic>-value&#x02009;=&#x02009;2.08&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). Another GC polymorphism frequently associated with serum 25(OH)D is rs7041. Wang&#x02019;s GWAS found a strong association of rs7041 with circulating 25(OH)D (overall meta-analytic <italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.9&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;109</sup>), Engleman demonstrated an initial P value for rs7041&#x02032;s association with serum 25(OH)D of 0.02, however after association analysis of haplotype blocks it was determined that rs7041 was not independently significant. We were unable to successfully genotype rs7041 in our study. Given conflicting evidence, more research may be necessary to further elucidate the relationship between GC polymorphism, rs7041, and serum 25(OH)D levels. What remains clear is that polymorphisms in both CYP2R1 and GC may have considerable phenotypic effects on serum 25(OH)D concentrations. The clinical relevance of these polymorphisms and their prevalence remain unknown.</p><p>In a previous study conducted by our group of investigators, we demonstrated that increase in vitamin D intake, baseline serum 25(OH)D level, baseline blood collection season, baseline serum calcium level, and baseline BMI were associated with serum 25(OH)D response variation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b52">52</xref>, a finding consistent with the current body of literature. Taken together, these five factors account for 46.8 percent of the vitamin D response variation, however this still leaves a significant portion of the total variation unaccounted for. Several recent studies have suggested that genetics plays a role in response to vitamin D intake<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>, potentially bridging this gap. Two genes thus far implicated in this process are CYP2R1 and GC, both of which have already been shown (both within this paper and by others) to be involved in regulating baseline serum 25(OH)D. Fu <italic>et al</italic>. showed that the rs4588 SNP in GC was associated with response to vitamin D supplementation with the highest increase in serum 25(OH)D levels seen with the minor homozygote genotype. Nimitphong, in a small Thai study, replicated these findings<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Waterhouse <italic>et al</italic>. in a much larger study, did not find any statistically significant association of rs4588 and response to vitamin D supplementation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref>. Our study echoed these later findings, as we could not establish any significant association between rs4588 and vitamin D dose response (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.1523). The 2009 study by Fu <italic>et al</italic>. included only 98 adults and the 2013 study by Nimitphong <italic>et al</italic>. had only 41 subjects, all of them of Thai decent. Given the superior sample size, breadth, and statistical power of both our study and the Waterhouse study (358 and 385 participants with genetic analysis as well as measured baseline and follow up serum 25 (OH)D values respectively) relative to the Fu <italic>et al</italic>. and Nimitphong <italic>et al</italic>. studies, we feel that GC, and specifically rs4588, is not significantly associated with vitamin D response variation. However, CYP2R1 gene may be involved. Waterhouse <italic>et al</italic>. found that SNP rs10766197 in CYP2R1 was associated with vitamin D dose response, with the greatest increase in serum 25(OH)D concentration reported for those homozygous for the major allele (they also demonstrated an association of this SNP and baseline 25(OH)D levels as we have). Didrikson <italic>et al</italic>. came to the same conclusion in their study. Our data failed to demonstrate any statistically significant association for CYP2R1 SNP rs10766197 and vitamin D dose response (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.20). Given these divergent results, further research may be necessary to reach a consensus on CYP2R1 and its regulation of vitamin D dose response.</p><p>Although our study demonstrated no statistically significant association of CYP2R1 and GC polymorphisms with vitamin D dose response, we were able to illustrate the association of SNP rs11185644 with serum 25(OH)D response to vitamin D supplementation after adjusting for age, BMI, and phlebotomy season (<italic>P</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.01&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;10<sup>&#x02212;4</sup>). This polymorphism, which has barely to be described in the literature thus far, lies in upstream of the transcription start sites of the RXRA gene. The RXRA gene encodes the retinoic X receptor alpha, which is one of the nuclear receptors that mediate the biological effects of retinoid via their involvement in retinoic acid-mediated gene activation. So far, the longest distance scanned for RXRA promoter is 5&#x02009;kb upstream of the translation start site (TSS)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b53">53</xref>. Therefore, the SNP may not belong to the promoter region of the RXRA. The SNP is located in intergenic region, between gene RXRA and the uncharacterized LOC105376310. It is ~7.5&#x02009;kb near the 5&#x02032; of the RXRA gene and ~24&#x02009;kb ahead of the 3&#x02032; of the LOC105376310. The identified significant polymorphism, SNP rs11185644, is barely studied or reported. Only one paper which investigated the relationship between this SNP and pancreatic adenocarcinoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b54">54</xref>. This is the first study reporting the association between SNP rs11185644 and vitamin D dose response. Based on limited information of the SNP, its function is largely unknown.</p><p>Previous research has demonstrated that differences in serum 25(OH)D levels between the genotypes studied were most pronounced after 6 months of vitamin D supplementation, implying that mechanisms underlying CYP2R1&#x02019;s and GC&#x02019;s effects on response to vitamin D supplementation may be time-sensitive and may perhaps reach a saturation point<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>. Didrikson&#x02019;s findings suggest that this study&#x02019;s results and associations may have differed if the time scale for follow-up measurements was shortened.</p><p>This study measured the total serum 25(OH)D levels; however, there is the possibility that the free 25(OH)D level is related to some phenotypes associated with variations in vitamin D levels, such as bone mineral density<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b55">55</xref>, and that the free 25(OH)D levels may be subject to genetic influences as well. Future research should measure the biologically active free 25(OH)D levels in relation to SNPs in CYP2R1, GC, and other implicated genes.</p><p>Our findings are noteworthy because they are based on a large, well control clinical trial study. The power estimation under current parameter setting is over 95%. Our homogeneous study population also contributed to the reliability of our findings. All subjects were postmenopausal Caucasian women from the same geographical area in rural Nebraska (41.4 degrees North latitude). Adherence to vitamin D supplementation was also considered, adding to the validity of our data. Furthermore, using 12-month vitamin D <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S1">supplementation data</xref> reduced the confounding effect of season. There are, however, a few limitations to the current study. First, Due to the nature of the clinical trials, the parent studies did not consider data regarding dietary vitamin D intake and sun exposure. Information about medication or additional pathologies are not included in the exclusion criteria, which may affect vitamin D status. For instance, GI pathology or medications affecting gut absorption of vitamin D may influence the results. Although such information was not collected, the randomization that we did for the two clinic trials should reduce the confounding effect of these factors. Second, in drafting a list of genes and polymorphisms for association analysis, a gene responsible for cholecalciferol production in the skin<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref>, DHCR7/NADSYN, was not included in our study. A Swiss study recently implicated this gene in vitamin D metabolism, finding that SNPs in DHCR7 were associated with serum 25(OH)D levels in northeastern Han Chinese children<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b56">56</xref>. Third, the doses of vitamin D intervention were different in the two studies, 1100 IU/day for CaMEWS and 2000 IU/day for D&#x00026;Cancer. Although vitamin D3 with 1100 IU/d or 2000 IU/d was administered, not all subjects followed the instruction and took the required pills each day. In the study, adherence rate was evaluated. The doses of vitamin D of the interventions were adjusted and standardized. Serum 25(OH)D dose-response was served as the phenotype. Therefore, we don&#x02019;t think the different vitamin D3 doses were a big problem for the study. Lastly, this research was limited to postmenopausal Caucasian women, therefore limiting the generalizability of this study&#x02019;s findings. However, these preliminary findings present an opportunity for further research in different population groups; African Americans, for instance, have lower baseline vitamin D levels than their white counterparts<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b57">57</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b58">58</xref>, and should be considered for inclusion in future research. Our study demonstrates that genetic polymorphisms in genes involved with vitamin D metabolism and function may impact serum vitamin D levels in one particular cohort. Further research is required to elucidate whether these polymorphisms and others yet discovered partially underlie racial differences in vitamin D.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Subjects and trial design</title><p>The subjects for this study are non-Hispanic white postmenopausal women from two previously completed vitamin D3 intervention studies. Both studies were population-based, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blinded, calcium and vitamin D3 intervention clinical trials. Samples from the two parent studies were demographically similar. The participants were randomly selected from a rural area of Nebraska (approximately 41.4 degrees N) and were all&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;55 years.</p><p>The subject inclusion criteria for the two parent studies were: (1) good general health; (2)&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;4 years post menopause; and (3) the ability to live independently and travel to the Creighton University Osteoporosis Research Center (ORC) Study Site at Fremont Area Medical Center (FAMC). Subjects were excluded if they exhibited: (1) any history of cancer or other malignancies treated curatively&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;10 years ago, except superficial basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin; (2) known metabolic bone diseases; (3) chronic kidney disease; (4) Paget&#x02019;s disease; (5) co-morbidity of tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. All subjects provided written informed consent for the study. The Institutional Review Board at Creighton University (Omaha, NE) approved both studies. Safety was assessed in participants who received Calcium and vitamin D with the given dose.</p><p>The first parent study &#x0201c;Calcium and Vitamin D Malnutrition in Elderly Women Study&#x0201d; (CaMEWS) began in 2000 and was completed in 2005. The participants have been described in detail in our other papers<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b59">59</xref>. Briefly, 1,179 non-Hispanic white postmenopausal women were enrolled, and assigned to receive either 1500&#x02009;mg/d supplemental calcium alone (Calcium only group), supplemental calcium (1500&#x02009;mg/d) plus 1100IU/d vitamin D3 (Ca&#x02009;+&#x02009;D group), or double placebos (placebo group). Supplements were given to the subjects by the project nurses at each 6-mo visit.</p><p>The second parent study, &#x0201c;Clinical Trial of Vitamin D3 to Reduce Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Women (D&#x00026;Cancer),&#x0201d; was a population&#x02013;based sample of 2,300 healthy postmenopausal women from 2009 and was completed in 2015. Half of the sample (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1,150 subjects) received supplements of vitamin D3 (2000 IU/day) and calcium (1500&#x02009;mg/day) (Ca&#x02009;+&#x02009;D group); the remaining half received placebos of vitamin D3 and calcium (placebo group).</p><p>For both studies, vitamin D3 was made by Tishcon Corp (Westbury, NY), supplied such that each capsule had 2000 IU for D&#x00026;Cancer study and 1100 IU for CaMEWS. Each subject received one capsule of vitamin D or identical placebo based on their assigned group. Subjects can&#x02019;t tell the difference of the capsule of vitamin D or placebo from their appearance. To ensure the quality of the drug, we used each batch of capsules within one year. We analyzed a sample of each lot of vitamin D3 when we received it and at the end of each year to assure potency.</p><p>In the double blinded clinical trials, participants were randomly assigned to the groups before their baseline circulating vitamin D levels were measured. Because of the high incidence of osteoporosis in the postmenopausal women and because some subjects would be given placebos, we believe it would be unethical to advise women to avoid self- supplementation. Participants would be informed that they may be assigned to placebo calcium and vitamin D. Participants were allowed to take their own vitamin D, but we asked them to limit that to no more than 400 IU/day if they are&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;70 years of age and to no more than 600 IU/day if they are&#x02009;&#x02265;&#x02009;70, which are the currently recommended intake levels.</p><p>The two trials were both registered at ClinicalTrials.gov website (NCT00352170 for CaMEWS study and NCT01052051 for D&#x00026;Cancer study) on 12 July 2006 and 19 January 2010 respectively, and ClinicalTrials.gov processed this record on April 05, 2016. No changes to the methodology occurred following trial commencement. We confirmed that all methods were performed in accordance with the approved guidelines and regulations. We report and present data according to the CONSORT statement.</p><p>In order to identify genes for dose-response variability to vitamin D3 supplementation, we need subjects who have DNA available. The original clinical trials did not intend to collect whole blood and have DNA extracted. With the limited fund, after the completion of the CaMEWS (which were completed in 2005), of the 1,179 subjects, we reenrolled 358 women for their blood draw and DNA extraction. Of the 358 subjects, 155 participants were in the calcium-only group while 203 participants were in the Calcium&#x02009;+&#x02009;Vitamin D group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>). For the D&#x00026;Cancer, of the 2,300 participants, with the limited fund, 1,849 women had their DNA samples extracted and have vitamin D response data for the study. Of the 1,849 subjects, 934 of these measurements came from the placebo group, while 915 came from the Calcium&#x02009;+&#x02009;Vitamin D group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>In summary, a total of 2,207 subjects (358 subjects from CaMEWS and 1,849 subjects from D&#x00026;Cancer study) were included in the analysis of gene association with baseline serum 25(OH)D levels. <xref ref-type="table" rid="t1">Table 1</xref> lists the characteristics of the 2,207 subjects used for this study.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Primary and secondary outcome measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure of the first parent study (CaMEWS study) is fractures, and the secondary outcome measures are changes in bone mass and density, changes in serum 25(OH)D measurement and so on.

No change occurred to trial outcomes after the trials commenced. In the current study, the primary outcome measure is serum 25(OH)D dose-response variation.

The blood collection dates were transformed into three periods (December through February, the first period with poor UVB exposure from sunlight; March through May, and September through November, the second period with plentiful UVB exposure from sunlight; June through August, the third period with strong UVB exposure from sunlight).</p><p>Serum 25(OH)D concentration was measured by RIA (Nichols/Quest Diagnostics, San Clemente, CA or DiaSorin assay (Stillwater, MN) for each participant at baseline and after 12-month intervention. The measurement combines 25-hydroxyvitamin D2 and 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, thus, only total 25-hydroxyvitamin concentration were reported. The measurement can&#x02019;t quantitates 25(OH)D2 and 25(OH)D3 separately. All biochemical analyses were completed in a single laboratory that participates in the Quality Assurance Program for vitamin D. Other important variables that may influence variation in serum 25(OH)D, such as age, weight, height, total calcium supplement, serum calcium levels, blood collection dates, adherence to the trial vitamin D supplementation, and self-selected vitamin D supplementation were collected at baseline and at the end of study. BMI (body mass index) was defined as weight (kilograms) divided by height squared (square meters). Compliance with trial vitamin D supplementation was assessed at 6-month intervals by bottle weight and mean adherence (defined as taking 80% of assigned doses) was 86%<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>.</p><p>The phenotypes for the study were baseline serum 25(OH)D variation and serum 25(OH)D dose-response variation.</p><p>In both clinical trials, the trial vitamin D supplement was calculated as per-protocol supplement dose adjusted for individual compliance rates. Adherence with supplementation were determined by weighting each bottle of vitamin D3 tablets before distributing the bottle and after it was returned by the participant every 6 months. We initially determined the weight of each pill: calcium, vitamin D3, placebo calcium and placebo D3. To do this, we weighed the empty bottle and then the full bottle. Then we subtracted the weight of the empty bottle from the weight of the full bottle and divided the difference by the number of tablets in the bottle. Participants do not evaluate their compliance. We assess the compliance at six-monthly intervals by bottle weight. Bottles were dark so that light could not penetrate.</p><p>In addition to the administrated trial vitamin D, subjects were allowed to take their self-selected vitamin D supplement.
