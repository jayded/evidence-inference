Diabetic patients were those without diabetic foot and cardiovascular side effects and were randomly selected from a diabetes center, Ahmad Nader Kazemi Clinic and they were randomly divided into two groups of experimental and control. Data was collected using a standard questionnaire including data on demographic characteristics, knowledge, dimensions of health belief model including perceived obstacles, interests, intensity and sensitivity, and also data regarding jogging. In addition, the amount of fasting blood sugar (FBS) and glycoside hemoglobin (HbA1c) of the patients before and three months after the training intervention were recorded. The intervention was 3 sessions (each 60 minutes) of training on jogging and control of sugar. Reliability of the questionnaire was reviewed by means of taking a reexamination and it was certainly defined 84% and its faults were also eliminated. For understanding 5-choice questions and questions related to the dimensions of health belief model, Likert 5-choice theory meter scale was used and the time period of jogging of patients was also measured during the last week based on minute.</p><p>Ethical approval for this study was obtained from Research Ethical Committee of Shiraz University of Medical Sciences. Data analysis was performed using SPSS software (Version 15, Chicago, IL, USA). Chi square test, independent and pair-T test were used.
