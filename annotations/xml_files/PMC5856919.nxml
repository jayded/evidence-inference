Baseline demographic and disease characteristics of all patients randomised to CZP have been published previously and are summarised in&#x000a0;online <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SP1">supplementary table 1</xref>. Among patients randomised to placebo, 59 required early escape and were re-randomised to CZP at Week 16; 61 completed the double-blind phase and were re-randomised to receive CZP at Week 24; 16 discontinued study treatment prior to re-randomisation to CZP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>). Of the 393 patients who received at least one dose of CZP at any time during the RAPID-PsA trial, 75 (19%) had prior anti-TNF exposure, 54 (72%) of whom were randomised to CZP at Week 0. Baseline demographics and disease severity characteristics were similar between all patients in the different dosing arms as has been reported previously.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>Of the 273 patients randomised to CZP at baseline, 248 (90.8%) patients completed to Week 24, 237 (86.8%) patients completed to Week 48 and 183 (67.0%) completed to Week 216 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">figure 1B</xref>). In the combined double-blind, dose-blind and OL periods, 36/273 (13.2%) and 9/273 (3.3%) patients withdrew from the study due to an AE or lack of efficacy, respectively; 45/273 (16.5%) withdrew for

CZP demonstrated long-term efficacy in achieving improvement in disease activity in most of the major disease domains of PsA; for most patients completing the trial, CZP treatment demonstrated sustained efficacy in improving joint disease, skin and nail psoriasis, enthesitis and dactylitis, by all disease activity and PRO measures assessed, which was similar with both 200&#x02009;mg Q2W and 400&#x02009;mg Q4W dose regimens. The study has shown CZP to have a safety profile that is expected for this therapeutic class, with the most frequent serious TEAEs being infections; no new safety signals have been identified since the&#x000a0;Week 96 report of RAPID-PsA.<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></p><p>More than 7 in every 10 patients with PsA completing 4&#x02009;years&#x02019; CZP treatment (and 6/10 of the intention-to-treat population) achieved DAPSA remission or DAPSA LDA, which relate to improvements in peripheral joint disease and patient reported outcomes. An international taskforce of physicians and patients recently developed recommendations for treatment targets in PsA; they acknowledged that DAPSA remission may be difficult to achieve in patients with long-standing disease, for whom they recommend MDA be used as a treatment target.<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> Almost 60% of patients completing 4 years&#x02019; CZP treatment had achieved MDA (&#x02265;5/7 MDA criteria), and half of those also achieved the most stringent target of VLDA (7/7 MDA criteria) indicating that CZP can deliver low disease activity with respect to articular disease, skin disease, pain, function and PROs, for a substantial proportion of patients.</p><p>There is overlap between the DAPSA and MDA/VLDA treatment targets; however, the latter also includes the domain of skin disease. There are diverse opinions regarding whether it is better to assess skin separately (in addition to the DAPSA) or as part of the composite outcome (such as the MDA/VLDA).<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> Psoriasis is a cause of frustration and embarrassment in many patients with PsA that adds substantially to their burden of disease and lessens their quality of life.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23 24</xref> CZP demonstrated sustained efficacy in improving psoriatic skin disease, with more than half of the intention-to-treat population in RAPID-PsA with BSA&#x000a0;&#x02265;3% at baseline having achieved BSA&#x000a0;&#x02264;1% at Week 216.</p><p>Nail psoriasis, dactylitis and enthesitis also contribute significantly to the impact of disease on patients&#x02019; quality of life.<xref rid="R25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> RAPID-PsA has demonstrated the sustained, long-term efficacy of CZP in improving these symptoms of&#x000a0;PsA, with more than 6 in every 10 patients with baseline involvement achieving total resolution of nail psoriasis, dactylitis and enthesitis.</p><p>PROs are important components in the evaluation of disease impact and therapy response in patients with PsA. The current study showed that patients treated with CZP reported improvements for all PROs measured. The largest improvement was in pain, which improved by more than 50%.&#x000a0;Structural joint damage in PsA has been associated with disease activity and severity<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> and often correlates with functional impairment.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> There was minimal progression of structural joint damage in patients with PsA treated with CZP, as measured by mTSS, throughout the 4 years of the RAPID-PsA trial, even in patients with more severe structural joint damage at baseline. The Week 216 radiographic results indicated that the proportion of patients treated with CZP over 4 years with structural joint damage non-progression from CZP baseline remained high. Except for CZP and golimumab, such long-term structural joint damage progression data have not been reported for other anti-TNFs or other biological DMARDs (targeting interleukin-12/17/23) and targeted synthetic DMARDs (phosphodiesterase type 4 inhibitors) approved for the treatment of PsA. Notably, the MMRM analysis used in this study to estimate radiographic progression assumed that the mTSS of patients who withdrew from the study would have been statistically similar to other patients receiving the same dose regimen and who had a similar observed mTSS at baseline, had they remained in the study&#x02014;an assumption that cannot be verified based on the available data.</p><p>In patients who do not respond adequately to their first biological DMARD, the GRAPPA and European League Against Rheumatism treatment guidelines for PsA both recommend switching to a second biological DMARD; including the option to switch between anti-TNFs.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5 21</xref> A head-to-head trial of CZP and the anti-TNF adalimumab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis recently demonstrated the efficacy and safety of switching to a second anti-TNF after primary failure to an initial anti-TNF.<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> In this study of CZP in patients with PsA, although only around 1 in 5 had previously been treated with an anti-TNF, the efficacy of CZP was similar in patients both with and without prior anti-TNF exposure, indicating that CZP may be effective in patients who do not respond adequately to their first biological&#x000a0;DMARD.</p><p>The limitations of the RAPID-PsA study include the lack of a placebo control beyond Week 24 and inherent bias in having dose-blind and OL periods, when the patient is aware that&#x000a0;they are receiving active treatment, as is their physician. As is true for all clinical trials, patient withdrawal from the study also introduces a risk of bias in the data, and the impact of patient withdrawal is likely to be greater in a long-term study. Imputation of the missing data that results from patient withdrawal helps to conserve the validity of the analyses, but also requires assumptions to be made about the measurements that patients would have had if they had remained in the study. Here, we have reported both observed and imputed data to minimise the risk of bias. Another limitation of clinical trials is that while the long-term clinical efficacy and safety data are relevant to clinical practice, the study participants are not completely representative of all patients treated in the clinical practice. In conclusion, the 4-year data demonstrating the efficacy of CZP across most PsA disease domains in the RAPID-PsA study support CZP treatment for the long-term therapeutic management of PsA.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the patients and their caregivers in addition to the investigators and their teams who contributed to this study.
