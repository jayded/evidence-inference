Of 65&#x02013;80% of patients with upper limb dysfunction, 37% have varying degrees of difficulty with upper limb fine motor control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Furthermore, approximately 50% are unable to complete activities of daily living (ADL) independently 3 months after stroke onset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Post-stroke upper limb dysfunctions, including coordination and execution problems of the arms, palms, and fingers, cause limitations in eating, dressing, showering, and other daily activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>], increasing the financial burden on families and society. Therefore, improving upper limb dysfunction is a significant priority for stroke rehabilitation so that patients can improve their abilities to perform ADL and optimize their quality of life.</p><p id="Par20">A variety of rehabilitation treatments are available for upper limb dysfunction after stroke, including upper limb motor training, adaptive equipment or aids, and traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). However, management of upper limb dysfunction after stroke is complicated, and a single treatment is not adequate. Thus, comprehensive multidisciplinary effective measures may significantly improve the level of rehabilitation.</p><p id="Par21">Currently, both acupuncture and mirror therapy (MT) are widely used for stroke rehabilitation, with MT being gradually applied by clinical researchers as a new treatment for post-stroke limb rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>], particularly for severe upper limb and pain rehabilitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. One study revealed that, after 1 month of MT, the functional independence measure score increased from 52 &#x000b1; 17.16 to 93.18 &#x000b1; 22.07, the action research arm test score increased from 15.90 &#x000b1; 22.41 to 47.64 &#x000b1; 15.19, and the motricity index increased from 39.27 &#x000b1; 27.33 to 76 &#x000b1; 21.78. Therefore, compared to conventional treatment, MT is a promising and simple method of improving motor recovery of the upper limbs of subacute stroke patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par22">Acupuncture originated in ancient China approximately 2500 years ago as an important component of TCM. It has been used for thousands of years in several Asian countries to treat a variety of diseases. Acupuncture is simple and effective and has no adverse drug reactions. It has become a popular topic in the field of rehabilitation medicine in China. However, whether acupuncture promotes recovery from stroke remains controversial. Several studies have demonstrated that acupuncture treatment (AT) may promote the recovery of upper limb dysfunction after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. One study involving a post-hoc analysis showed that the electrical stimulation group had greater improvements in hand grip (<italic>P</italic> = 0.015) and pinch strength (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007) than the control group after 4 weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, a systematic review showed that the methodologic quality of the included trials was inadequate and that the results may not be reliable because of substantial heterogeneity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p id="Par23">Acupuncture is a state-of-the-art TCM treatment widely utilized in China. The advantages of AT are its simplicity, convenience, affordability, and efficacy. The use of AT for the treatment of upper limb dysfunction associated with stroke is in alignment with China&#x02019;s healthcare development priorities. Furthermore, MT is an important component of modern Western rehabilitation. The combination of AT and MT not only embodies the combination of Chinese and Western medicine but also reflects the integration of modern and traditional rehabilitation. If the rehabilitation program is proven to be effective, then its clinical effectiveness will be important for patients requiring rehabilitation. In addition, it is unknown whether the outcomes of combined AT and MT are superior to those of MT alone because very few studies have compared the two therapies.</p><p id="Par24">Therefore, we designed a 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial randomized controlled trial to explore the clinical efficacy of AT combined with MT to improve the upper limb motor function of stroke patients. We hypothesized that the synergistic effect of both therapies is greater than the sum of the individual effects of each intervention if they are used separately. AT or MT significantly improved upper limb function outcomes to a similar extent compared with the control group.</p><p id="Par25">During this trial, our first aim will be to assess the synergistic effects of AT and MT on the recovery of upper limb function after stroke. Our second aim will be to determine whether AT and MT, alone or in combination, are more effective than conventional treatment for the rehabilitation of upper limb dysfunction after stroke.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study design and setting</title><p id="Par26">This trial will use a 2 &#x000d7; 2 factorial randomized controlled study to explore the clinical efficacy of AT combined with MT for improving the upper limb motor function of stroke patients. It will be performed in the Rehabilitation Hospitals Affiliated with Fujian University of Traditional Chinese Medicine (FJTCM). A total of 136 eligible subjects will be randomly divided into four groups, namely (1) AT group, (2) MT group, (3) combined treatment group (AT + MT), and (4) control group, in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. All subjects will receive conventional treatment, including health education and conventional medical therapy. The interventions will be performed 5 days per week for 4 weeks. AT, MT, and combined treatment (AT 15 min + MT 15 min) will be performed for 30 min per day. Therapists with more than 5 years of clinical experience will perform the interventions. A 4-week intervention and 12-week follow-up period will be conducted. Outcome measurements include the Fugl&#x02013;Meyer Assessment for Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Wolf Motor Function Test (WMFT), Visual Analogue Scale (VAS), Stroke Impact Scale (SIS), Modified Barthel Index (MBI), and adverse events. The flow diagram for this trial is presented in Fig. <xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>. The undertaking unit of this project (the Rehabilitation Hospitals Affiliated with FJTCM) and the ethics committees are responsible for making protocol decisions and for communicating important protocol modifications. In addition, the project undertaking unit is responsible for coordinating the work of all departments (e.g., trial registries, researcher training, informed consent of the participants, data management). If there are important protocol modifications, the project undertaking unit will notify relevant parties to convene a coordination meeting.<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Flow diagram of study design</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="13063_2018_2585_Fig1_HTML" id="MO1"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par27">Sample size was calculated based on the improvement in FMA-UE scores. Based on similar previous reports, the mean difference and SD were 42.86 &#x000b1; 3.74 and 41.68 &#x000b1; 3.44 for AT and conventional therapy, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. We expect an effect size of at least 0.3 for outcomes after intervention. A sample size of 112 participants is required to sufficiently detect a target effect size with a type 1 error of 5% (&#x003b1; = 0.05) and 80% power (&#x003b2; = 0.20) by using Gpower 3.1.9.2 software.

Patients will be instructed to sit close to a table on which a 35 &#x000d7; 35 cm mirror is vertically placed and then to put the upper limbs on the table. The contralateral upper limb will be positioned toward the reflective surface of the mirror, and the ipsilateral upper limb will be positioned on the opposite side of the mirror. Finally, patients will be required to observe the movement of the contralateral upper limbs in the mirror and to imagine the affected side in motion. Then, they will be required to perform the movement of the affected side as consistently as possible (if patients cannot complete the movement, then the experienced therapist will assist). Patients will need to complete six movements, namely shoulder flexion, elbow flexion and extension, forearm pronation, wrist flexion and extension, finger stretching, and thumb outreach. Patients will be asked to achieve a maximum range of motion for 30 min per day for 5 days per week for 4 weeks.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16"><title>AT protocol</title><p id="Par38">Participants will be treated using five acupuncture points on the hemiplegia side (Jianyu [LI15], Quchi [LI11], Shou sanli [LI10], Hegu [LI4], and Waiguan [TE5]) by an acupuncturist with more than 5 years of clinical experience. AT will be performed with patients in the supine position. Points will be sterilized with alcohol, and the target position will then be fixed by the acupuncturist&#x02019;s left hand. The acupuncturist&#x02019;s right hand will insert the thin, disposable acupuncture needles (Huatuo, single use, 0.30 &#x000d7; 40 mm; Suzhou HuaTuo Medical Instruments, Suzhou, China).</p><p id="Par39">The angle of insertion will be 10&#x000b0;&#x02013;20&#x000b0; (between the needle and skin), and the needle depth will be approximately 1.0&#x02013;1.5 B-cun. Following insertion, stimulation of the acupuncture point will be performed with bidirectional rotation of the needle sleeve at approximately 18&#x02013;300 per min to achieve the sensation known as <italic>Deqi</italic>, which is commonly described as a glowing feeling.</p><p id="Par40">The needle will be maintained in place for 30 min.

Telephone follow-up will be performed once every 4 weeks, and records of the medications and rehabilitation therapies will be kept. During the 6- and 12-week follow-up periods (10 weeks and 16 weeks after intervention), participants will be referred for clinical evaluation to assess their functional status, including upper limb function, quality of life, and ADL.</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Outcome assessment</title><p id="Par43">The study period is 16 weeks. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline, after 4 weeks of intervention, at 6-week follow-up, and at 12-week follow-up.

All assessors will be trained to administer these assessments.</p></sec><sec id="Sec20"><title>Primary outcomes</title><p id="Par44">The primary outcomes in this study are the mean change in the scores on both the FMA and WMFT from baseline to 4 weeks intervention and 12 weeks follow-up between the two groups and within groups.</p><p id="Par45">The FMA is widely used for motor function assessment and can reflect the functional level of stroke subjects. Even during the early stage of functional recovery, it can distinguish the level of motor function, particularly for those who have low responsiveness. The upper extremity has a maximum score of 66 points divided into three parts, namely shoulder&#x02013;arm (36 points), wrist&#x02013;hand (24 points), and coordination (6 points). The FMA-UE is the most common scale for evaluating upper limb motor function after stroke. It is often used as a gold standard for testing the validity of other scales as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. The FMA-UE has excellent reliability and validity and is sensitive enough for clinical and research practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p id="Par46">The WMFT is the preferred scale for assessing mandatory exercise therapy for improving upper limb functions. It can either assess the quality of the patient&#x02019;s completion of each activity or determine the time required for the patient to do so. The WMFT has good reliability and validity and high internal consistency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec21"><title>Secondary outcomes</title><p id="Par47">The mean change in the scores on the VAS, SIS, and MBI after 4 weeks intervention are considered secondary outcomes.</p><p id="Par48">In this study, the VAS will be used to evaluate the highest overall pain level of the upper limb on the affected side during the week before the assessment. The basic method is to use a 10-cm horizontal line (one marked with 10 scales, with endpoints &#x0201c;0&#x0201d; and &#x0201c;10&#x0201d;), which allows patients to indicate the degree of pain. Zero indicates no pain and 10 indicates the most intense pain. In clinical practice, the VAS is considered the most sensitive and reliable method for measuring pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p id="Par49">SIS is mainly used to evaluate the impact of stroke on the health and quality of life of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. The scale involves items measuring dysfunction caused by stroke and the impact on the patient&#x02019;s life, with scores ranging from 0 to 100, and assesses the patients&#x02019; overall perceptions of recovery after stroke. The scale includes eight domains (strength, hand function, ADL/instrumental ADL, mobile ability, communication, mood, memory and thinking, and participation) and has a total of 59 items.</p><p id="Par50">MBI is the most commonly used internationally recognized evaluation tool for testing the ability to perform ADL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. This scale includes items related to bowel and bladder continence, grooming, toileting, feeding, transfer, walking, dressing, bathing, and going up and down stairs. A normal score is 100, and lower scores indicate greater dependency.</p></sec><sec id="Sec22"><title>Safety assessments</title><p id="Par51">Acupuncture may cause discomfort or bruising at the sites of needle insertion, nausea, or feeling faint after each treatment.

Every year, approximately 70&#x02013;80% of new patients lose their ability to work to varying degrees and cannot take care of themselves, placing a heavy burden on patients, families, and society [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Upper limb motor dysfunction is a great challenge during stroke rehabilitation.</p><p id="Par65">Studies have confirmed that direct current stimulation, strength training, robot-assisted training, virtual reality therapy, constraint-induced movement therapy, and other rehabilitation therapies could achieve different degrees of improvement about upper limb function after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Furthermore, AT and MT seem to be beneficial for the recovery of upper limb dysfunction after stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].</p><p id="Par66">The effect of AT is mainly achieved by stimulating acupuncture points called &#x0201c;acupoints,&#x0201d; which are specific parts of the body used to gather Qi and blood. Acupoints are not only the external reactions of internal diseases in the body but also points for the treatment of disease. The specific effect of AT on diseases is mainly elicited through activating Qi and blood, as well as balancing Yin and Yang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. AT can adjust the upper limb meridians and help alleviate tendon stagnation, which would eventually help the normalization of the upper limb function.</p><p id="Par67">MT is based on the mirror neuron system. It uses the plane mirror imaging principle for the contralateral activity images projected on the affected side. It also combines optical illusions, visual feedback, and virtual reality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. One study has further indicated that MT can promote the recovery of limb function after stroke, thereby improving the ability to perform ADL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p id="Par68">However, the effects of AT and MT have not been systematically compared, and the possibility of a synergistic effect of their combination has not been evaluated. Therefore, we propose a rigorous, randomized, controlled clinical trial to demonstrate that the two treatment methods applied alone or in combination are more effective than the conventional treatment. In this study, we will systematically evaluate the effects of different treatments on upper limb motor dysfunction after stroke and assess the upper limb motor function and daily activity. We will also judge the long-term stability of improvements during a 12-week follow-up examination after intervention.</p><p id="Par69">The major limitation of this protocol is its non-double-blind design. However, the outcome assessors and statistical analysts will be blind to the intervention to decrease possible bias and ensure the quality of this trial. This study also lacks long-term follow-up observations and assessments. The 4-week intervention cycle reflects its application in real-world clinical practice and is sufficient to test whether the rehabilitation program is effective in the short term.</p><p id="Par70">In conclusion, the results of this study are expected to elucidate the synergistic effects of AT and MT on upper limb dysfunction after stroke. Furthermore, the results are expected to confirm whether AT and MT, either combined or alone, are more effective than conventional treatment for the management of post-stroke upper limb dysfunction (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><sec id="Sec27"><title>Trial status</title><p id="Par71">Ongoing recruitment.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional file</title><sec id="Sec28"><p>
