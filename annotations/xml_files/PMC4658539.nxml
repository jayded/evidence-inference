Before and after the conditioning, we conducted a conditioned place preference (CPP) test to measure preferences for the cues (Rooms 1 and 2), and a hot plate test (HPT) to measure the pain responses to high level-pain after the cues. In addition, we quantified the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and c-Fos in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) as a response to reward learning and pain response. We found an enhanced preference for the low level-pain paired cue and enhanced TH expression in the VTA of the Placebo and Placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;Naloxone groups. Haloperidol, a dopamine antagonist, blocked these effects in the Placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;Haloperidol group. An increased pain threshold to high-heat pain and reduced c-Fos expression in the ACC were observed in the Placebo group only. Haloperidol blocked the place preference effect, and naloxone and haloperidol blocked the placebo analgesia. Cue preference is mediated by reward learning via the dopamine system, whereas the expression of placebo analgesia is mediated by the dopamine and opioid systems.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><p>Recent research on the mechanism of placebo analgesia has examined the brain&#x02019;s response to painful stimulation modulated by expectation or Pavlovian conditioning. Early studies in humans demonstrated that administration of a neurotransmitter antagonist (naloxone) reversed the placebo-induced analgesic effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref>. Subsequent studies have investigated differential or overlapping mechanisms between conditioning and the expectation-induced placebo effect, including the endogenous opioid, cannabinoid, and dopamine systems<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b5">5</xref>. Furthermore, the development of neuroimaging techniques has helped researchers to determine the brain mechanism of placebo analgesia in humans. Several studies have shown that activity is altered due to expectation-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref> or conditioning-induced placebo analgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b7">7</xref> via a &#x003bc;-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref> or non-opioid<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b9">9</xref> mechanism in brain regions associated with pain processing and pain modulation (e.g., the frontal cortex, cingulate cortex, insula).</p><p>Placebo analgesia was first investigated in humans<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. In human studies, verbal instructions and subjective ratings are important in inducing and measuring the phenomenon, and the mechanisms of placebo analgesia may differ due to disease, physical and emotional conditions, therapeutic interventions, the medical environment, and the manner in which the placebo is induced<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref>. A desire to maximize placebo responses in clinical practice<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref> and interest in drug&#x02013;placebo interactions<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b13">13</xref> have been discussed in recent studies showing the important role of cognitive factors on the placebo effect in experimental and clinical settings in human. Although human studies also successfully contributed to reveal the mechanism of placebo effect, there is still a strong need for an animal model of placebo analgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>. First, it is generally hard to control for these cognitive factors in human studies because they include a sheer magnitude of elements such as context, beliefs, culture, previous experiences, prejudices, expectations, etc<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. The animal model has advantages over human studies in terms of controlling previous experience and environmental factors, drug administration, brain lesion or genetic modification, and measurement of pain-related neurochemicals in the brain directly<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b19">19</xref>. Existing animal models employ Pavlovian conditioning paradigms (e.g., injection of an analgesic drug as a conditioning cue) and measure behavioral pain responses. However, the injection procedure is painful, which could lead to stress responses that cause emotional and physical changes in the animal<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref>, and the active drug injection could also interact with placebo-specific changes in the animals. The placebo analgesia studies in animals could be improved by examining the placebo analgesia related neurotransmitter activities in the brain.</p><p>To overcome the limitations of previous studies and investigate the specific mechanism underlying placebo analgesia, we used healthy rats and a conditioning paradigm in which a neutral cue was conditioned with different pain intensities. We also introduced a differentiation between the learning phase (learning of low-pain-paired (LPP) and high-pain-paired (HPP) cues are important phases that precede placebo analgesia in rodents<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b22">22</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b23">23</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b24">24</xref>) from the placebo analgesia response (expression) phase. The major benefit of our experimental paradigm is that the placebo analgesia related brain activities in the learning (acquisition) and the placebo analgesia response (expression) phase could be measured separately. Dopamine plays an important role in Pavlovian conditioning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b25">25</xref>, and reward learning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b26">26</xref>; and haloperidol (dopamine antagonist) blocks the place preference induced by conditioning with various drugs (methamphetamine, cocaine, amphetamine, morphine, etc.). Moreover, as opioids are involved in placebo analgesia, naloxone (opioid antagonist) blocks the opioid conditioning-induced or expectation-induced placebo analgesia in both experimental and clinical pain models<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b2">2</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b27">27</xref>. Here we used Pavlovian conditioning of neutral cues with heat pain stimulation, and hypothesized that the dopamine system was involved in the cue-learning (acquisition) phase and that the endogenous opioid system was involved in the analgesia response (expression) phase of placebo analgesia.</p><p>To examine the role of dopamine and opioid systems in two phases of placebo analgesia, rats were divided into four groups: Control, Plaecbo, Placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;Naloxone, and Placebo&#x02009;+&#x02009;Haloperidol groups. Immunoreactivity was analyzed in dopamine or opioid related brain areas, ventral tegmental area (VTA) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and behavioral tests were conducted to assess the degree of cue learning and the placebo analgesia.</p><sec disp-level="1"><title>Methods</title><sec disp-level="2"><title>Animals</title><p>Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;82) weighing 220&#x02013;230&#x02009;g (7 weeks old) were obtained from Samtako Animal Co.

The animals were housed in a limited-access rodent facility with up to five rats per polycarbonate cage and maintained on a 12:12&#x02009;h day-night cycle (lights on from 8.00 a.m. to 8.00 p.m.) at room temperature (23&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;0.5&#x02009;&#x000b0;C). Sterilized drinking water and a standard chow diet were supplied ad libitum to each cage, and the animals&#x02019; weights were measured to monitor their physical condition. All experiments began at least 5 days after the animals arrived. The animal experiments were conducted in accordance with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NIH Publications no. 80&#x02013;23, revised in 1996), and were approved by the Kyung Hee University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p></sec><sec disp-level="2"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Rats were excluded if they: 1) were hypersensitive (a hind paw withdrawal latency [HPWL] of less than 50&#x02009;s to 45&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) or hyposensitive (an HPWL of more than 20&#x02009;s to 50&#x02009;&#x000b0;C) to thermal pain in the heat pain sensitivity test (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;8); 2) spent more than 300 s at the Center (33.3% of the total time) during conditioned place preference (CPP) test 1 (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;18); 3) did not prefer either of the two cues in CPP test 1 (unbiased rats, n&#x02009;=&#x02009;13); or 4) had malformed feet (n&#x02009;=&#x02009;1).

The enhanced preference for the LPP cue and the enhanced expression of TH in the VTA of placebo-conditioned rats were blocked by a dopamine antagonist but not by an opioid antagonist. The reduced pain response and c-Fos expression in the ACC were blocked by both dopamine and opioid antagonists. These results indicate that the dopamine system is involved in both cue learning and placebo analgesia, whereas the endogenous opioid system is involved in the analgesic response phase but not in the cue learning phase.</p><p>Learning and previous experiences play important roles in human placebo response<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b11">11</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b33">33</xref>. In this study, we separately analyzed the cue learning and placebo analgesia expression phases. Haloperidol, a D2, D3, and D4 dopamine receptor antagonist, prevented TH activities in the VTA, preferences for the LPP cue, and placebo analgesia. This may indicate that impaired cue learning due to reduced dopamine activity disrupted the placebo analgesia. However, both reward learning and aversive learning (preference for the LPP cue and avoidance of the HPP cue) are associated with the cue learning phases. Expectation of low level-pain produces placebo analgesia, whereas expectation of high level-pain produces a <italic>nocebo</italic> effect<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b34">34</xref>. Further research is necessary to distinguish the role of dopamine and brain activity in reward and avoidance learning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b35">35</xref> and the placebo and nocebo effects in placebo analgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b36">36</xref>. Recently Wrobel <italic>et al.</italic> carried out a neuroimaging study and reported that the haloperidol administered in healthy human participants had no significant effect on placebo analgesia<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. The discrepant results might have been found due to more complex learning and pain processing networks in the human brain compared to rodents such as the involvement of higher association cortex. In the study of Wrobel <italic>et al.</italic>, the prefrontal cortex and secondary somatosensory cortex were reported as the main brain areas associated in the placebo analgesia. Moreover, as Wrobel <italic>et al.</italic> have pointed out already, the dose of haloperidol as well as the detailed differences in the methods of the conditioning paradigm (temperature of stimuli, number of sessions, days, etc.) might have been critical for the different findings.</p><p>On the other hand, naloxone, a &#x003bc;-opioid receptor antagonist, prevented the placebo analgesia effect but did not affect the preference for the LPP cue. Thus, for placebo analgesia, opioids might affect pain processing per se rather than interrupting the learning process. These results also demonstrated the involvement of opioids in neutral cue conditioning, in addition to their previously known role in expectation or opioid conditioning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b38">38</xref>. However, it is difficult to discriminate expectation- or conditioning-induced placebo analgesia, as opioids are also related with the reward<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b39">39</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b40">40</xref>. Thus, further study of the role of opioids in neutral cue conditioning-induced placebo analgesia is required.</p><p>Traditionally, a neutral cue (conditioned stimulus, CS) can produce a conditioned response (CR) after conditioning with an unconditioned stimulus (US). In previous studies, a repeated US (drug application) paired with a contextual cue (CS, injection, or other cues: olfactory, visual, tactile, etc.) was used to establish a placebo analgesia animal model. These models were used to investigate whether the CS could relieve the pain (placebo analgesia, CR) in the absence of an US. Bryant <italic>et al.</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b41">41</xref> examined the analgesic effect after conditioning with an opioid receptor agonist. Other studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref> focused on placebo analgesia via vehicle injection after conditioning of active drugs in healthy rodents or in neuropathic pain models. Naloxone was the only antagonist used in previous studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b14">14</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>. One of the most important advantages of studies using na&#x000ef;ve animals is the ability of the experimenter to control the variables, including cognitive, emotional, environmental, and other placebo triggers. However, experimental environments contain unintended contextual cues, such as the experimenter, handling, the environment, temporal arrangement, and injection during drug delivery<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b42">42</xref>. In addition, saline injection, which was used in previous placebo studies, produces stress-related behavioral and physiological changes in rats<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b20">20</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b21">21</xref> that could affect the learning process and place preference<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b43">43</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b44">44</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b45">45</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b46">46</xref>. Analgesic drugs could also interact with the neuronal/biochemical pathways of the placebo analgesia. Therefore, we used neutral cues with a manipulated pain level rather than injection cues and active drugs. Similar experimental designs (i.e., placebo cream or visual cue paired with low-heat pain) were used in human studies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b6">6</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b37">37</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first placebo analgesic experiment to employ neutral cue conditioning with manipulated pain intensity in animals. Furthermore, we used a combination of cues (visual and tactile) to make the cues more distinguishable, and considered the pain intensity, temporal contiguity, frequency, duration, and number of sessions for successful conditioning<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b47">47</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b48">48</xref>.</p><p>The advantages of our model include: 1) being safer and less stressful compared to injection; 2) using a pain intensity that can be regulated depending on the subjects; 3) having two phases of placebo analgesia (acquisition and expression); and 4) being simple, which makes it possible to change or add details for further study. However, the efficacy, reliability, and long-term sustainability must be determined.</p><p>There were a number of limitations in this study. First, we did not include a natural history group, such as a no conditioning group. However, the control group in this study was exposed to an identical number of cues and similar heat pain to test changes in cue preference and pain response. Secondly, since we did not include a group that received haloperidol after the CPP phase, prior to the HPT, we cannot fully determine whether the abolished placebo effect in the haloperidol group was derived from the lack of learning or from the inhibition of dopamine release during the placebo test. In order to fully dissociate the mechanisms between dopamine and opioids during placebo analgesia, it is necessary to investigate the role of dopamine between the acquisition phase and the expression phase in placebo analgesia, which we plan to do in our future study. Furthermore, this study lacked subjective ratings, which are known to be more sensitive to the placebo effect than objectively measured outcomes<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b49">49</xref>. Alternatively, in addition to behavioral data, we analyzed immunoreactivity in the brain, which could be a neuronal biomarker of placebo analgesia. The procedure in this study was simple and sufficient to produce placebo analgesia; however, if placebo analgesia can be produced in less than 12 sessions, the whole procedure could be shortened. Our animal model could be a useful experimental paradigm for further investigating the underlying neural mechanisms of placebo analgesia, including the role of conditioning cues (e.g., visual, olfactory, light, sound, tactile), environment and context, treatment ritual, and interventions (drug or non-pharmacological). Last but not least, haloperidol, a non-selective dopamine receptor antagonist, is known to act on various subtypes of dopaminergic receptors. In order to further explore the role of specific dopamine receptors, it is necessary to investigate the mechanisms of placebo analgesia also using other receptor-specific antagonists.</p><p>In summary, we demonstrated that conditioning a neutral cue with low or high level-pain resulted in a significant cue preference to the LPP cue and placebo analgesia in animals. A dopamine antagonist blocked the acquisition of cue preference by learning; both dopamine and opioid antagonists blocked the expression of placebo analgesia. The increased preference to the LPP cue was significantly correlated with placebo analgesia. As the placebo animal model in this study used a neutral cue-conditioning paradigm with manipulated pain, this study could stimulate further cue-, context-, and intervention-specific studies of placebo analgesia.</p></sec><sec disp-level="1"><title>Additional Information</title><p><bold>How to cite this article</bold>: Lee, I.-S. <italic>et al.</italic> A new animal model of placebo analgesia: involvement of the dopaminergic system in reward learning. <italic>Sci.

During the CPP test, the doors were raised to 10&#x02009;cm above the floor, and the rats explored the CPP apparatus for 15&#x02009;min.

There was no fixed pairing between the cue and pain intensity in the Control group. The order was counterbalanced throughout the experiment.

The preference for cues between the pre- and post-conditioning tests did not significantly differ in the Control group.
