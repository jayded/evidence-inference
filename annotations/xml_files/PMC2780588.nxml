intermittent compression hand pump vs. cryotherapy were
compared on reduction of postoperative hand swelling and
gain in finger movement after distal radius fractures.
Although intermittent compression as a physical method for
thromboprophylaxis and swelling reduction in orthopaedic
and trauma patients of the lower leg are established, a
prospective randomised trial for an objective evaluation of
the effects of intermittent compression in the upper extremity
has not been previously performed. Forty-three subjects
(63&#x000b1;33 years, 32 women, 11 men) with a unilateral distal
radius fracture treated with transarticular external fixation
were randomised into two treatment groups. In group A 21
patients were treated with cryotherapy. In group B 22
patients were treated with an intermittent compression hand
pump. Reduction in swelling of the treated hand and MP and
PIP joint movement were recorded with computerised
assessment software (EVAL Hand Evaluation System) in
comparison to the uninjured contralateral side. Reduction of
swelling in group A was not statistically significant (28.5%
of total swelling or 0.61 cm, SD 0.39, <italic>p</italic>=0.42), but in group
B it was significant (92% of total swelling, 3.62 cm, SD 1.48,
<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Comparison of increases in MP and PIP joint
movement (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.0016) showed statistically significant differences
in favour of the intermittent compression pump. This
study demonstrates that intermittent compression is more
effective in the reduction of postoperative oedema and gain
of finger movement of the hand than cryotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Key words</title><kwd>Postoperative swelling</kwd><kwd>Intermittent compression

Acute swelling of the hand is a common problem after trauma or surgery and is associated with both pain and loss of function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Reduction of oedema is essential because swelling may interfere with blood supply and initiate algodystrophy. The therapeutic goal is to decrease soft tissue swelling, assist tendon mobility and prevent joint stiffness. Bulitta et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] have demonstrated the benefit of using an intermittent compression device for reduction of swelling in the foot. Erdmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] and Myerson and Henderson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] have proved this in randomised trials. The results of Stranks et al.

The average age of the 16 female and 5 male patients was 63 years (SD 14, range 30&#x02013;81 years). Each patient had the injured extremity stabilised preoperatively in a split plaster cast. The elevation of the limbs was 25&#x000b0; by suspending the injured hand on a cushion. Preoperative therapy started at hospital admission and was continued until 7 days after operation. Cryotherapy was performed in this study with a 500-g ice-pack, which was applied with the following schedule: ten times per day for seven days, 20 min of continuous ice application. Subjects were asked to rest in a supine position with their forearm fully supinated and extended.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Group B</title><p>The intermittent compression group included 22 patients. The average age of the 16 female and 6 male patients was 66 years (SD 16, range 28&#x02013;85 years). Each patient had the injured extremity stabilised preoperatively in a split plaster cast. In this group the A-V impulse system was used. This system is non-invasive and produces a high velocity surge of venous return. It consists of a bladder which is inflated to 130 mmHg for 2 s every 20 s by an electrically driven air compressor. After wrapping the hand and wrist with a thin layer of stocking the device was placed on the palm, with the thumb located in the cut-out provided. The end of the cover was then wrapped tight across the back of the hand and secured by Velcro fastener (Fig. <xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2</xref>). The A-V impulse system is compatible with other treatments and therapies such as external fixation or casting. The pump was used in this group for seven days, five times per day for one hour.

Immediately after surgery each patient of both groups started a similar physiotherapy regimen consisting of joint mobilisation, which was performed during intervals of either cryotherapy or intermittent compression device use.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection</title><p>The initial hand circumference measurements were taken at the point of maximum swelling on the injured hand, and compared to those of the uninjured hand in exactly the same position. Both hands were marked with indelible ink so that subsequent measurements were carried out at identical points on each occasion. This measurement was repeated until the 7th postoperative day.</p><p>Using the EVAL assessment software, MP and PIP joint movements of fingers 2&#x02013;5 of both hands were measured. This software is a McIntosh compatible computer program, which allows reliable measurement of individual movements of finger joints. In addition, the EVAL assessment software is characterised by reproducible measurements. The measurement was performed pre- and postoperatively by the same investigator and at the same time with regard to the treatment sessions every day. Measurement of hand circumference is an accepted and reliable tool, which is used in clinical follow-up, and for all reports of workers compensation insurance in Europe. The total duration of assessment was 7 days, when a final measurement was performed (Figs. <xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref> and <xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>] demonstrated a significant increase in venous blood return in the deep veins of the lower limb after applying a lower limb plaster cast with an intermittent compression device. Myerson and Henderson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>] showed a significant reduction of acute and chronic postsurgical swelling of the foot and ankle, using volumetric analysis. Erdmann et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>] demonstrated a significant reduction of pain, associated morbidity and convalescent time in intra-articular fractures of the calcis, a serious subset of trauma to the lower limb. Stranks et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>] showed that the incidence of deep venous thrombosis after hemiarthroplasty for hip fractures was reduced by increasing venous return with intermittent compression in the leg. In a prospective randomised study Asano et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] demonstrated the preventative effect of using a foot pump on the incidence of pulmonary embolism. In a randomised trial Delis et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>] found that intermittent pneumatic foot compression appears to be effective in improving the walking ability and haemodynamics in patients with stable intermittent claudication.</p><p>These results indicate a benefit from using intermittent compression devices as a physical method of thromboprophylaxis in orthopaedic, trauma and vascular patients. Intermittent compression therapy was used in this randomised trial for the treatment of post-traumatic and postoperative oedema of the hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>].</p><p>Oedema indicates a malfunction of the circulatory system. Arterial pressure causes blood to flow to the arm, and a pumping mechanism is needed for the return flow of venous blood and lymphatic fluid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Simons et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] demonstrated three synergistic independent venous pumping systems in the hand: the superficial palmar, deep palmar and dorsal veins, which are activated by palm compression, isometric intrinsic muscle contraction and dorsal compression. Normal movements of the hand and arm provide the impetus to push the fluid towards the axilla, through numerous valves in the afferent vessels. Postoperatively, these normal movements cease or are inhibited, and the pneumatic compression device mimics the natural physiological process that maintains the blood circulation. Kilgour et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>] demonstrated that the forearm vascular resistance measured by electrical impedance plethysmography drops after local hand cooling during the first 30 s of cooling, and then gradually rises to reach peak levels between 5 and 6 min of cooling. This study shows that the A-V impulse system is significantly more effective than cryotherapy in the treatment of postoperative oedema of the hand. Berlin et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] showed in a retrospective analysis of a large population the acute volume reduction in the affected hand and arm in postmastectomy lymphoedema.</p><p>Ramesh et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>] investigated the correlation between pneumatic compression of the hand and cubital vein blood flow. He found that continuous use of a pneumatic compression device (A-V impulse hand pump) for 48 h resulted in reduction in swelling of 78.6%, and intermittent use a reduction of 69.4%; they also found subjective reduction in pain perception and objective improvement in hand function. The reason for the improvement seen with the A-V impulse system could be an increase in the velocity of venous return as demonstrated by Duplex scanning of the medial cubital vein. In our pneumatic compression group we used the A-V impulse system four times per day for one hour, and this regime produced better results than cryotherapy. The reduction in swelling produces increased mobility of the MP and PIP joints, as we found in the EVAL assessment measurements. The increased range of motion of the uninvolved joints maintains mobility of joint capsule, ligaments and tendons, increases the circulation and assists in the reduction of oedema, as lack of mobility impairs outflow from the arm, causing increased oedema in the hand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study demonstrates that both reduction of postoperative swelling of the hand and gain in joint mobility are more significantly effected by using an intermittent compression hand pump than using cryotherapy. In our opinion the pneumatic compression device may be included in the therapeutic spectrum for postoperative oedema of the hand.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>One or more of the authors has received or will receive benefits for personal or professional use from a commercial party related directly or indirectly to the subject of this article.
