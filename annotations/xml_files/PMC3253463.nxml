Thus, this study aimed to determine the effect of ginger extract, or <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, on the cognitive function of middle-aged, healthy women. Sixty participants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or standardized plant extract at doses of 400 and 800&#x02009;mg once daily for 2 months. They were evaluated for working memory and cognitive function using computerized battery tests and the auditory oddball paradigm of event-related potentials at three different time periods: before receiving the intervention, one month, and two months. We found that the ginger-treated groups had significantly decreased P300 latencies, increased N100 and P300 amplitudes, and exhibited enhanced working memory. Therefore, ginger is a potential cognitive enhancer for middle-aged women.</p></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec id="sec1"><title>1. Introduction</title><p>Recent findings suggest that middle-aged women usually develop some form of cognitive impairment. It was found that middle-aged women performed poorly in various areas of cognitive function including attention, calculation and immediate recall (assessed using Minimental state examination (MMSE)) [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Evidence has also shown that oxidative stress contributes to cognitive impairment as age advanced [<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Due to the increase in the middle-aged population, an abundance of research has focused on the development of cognitive enhancers from medicinal plants reputed for antioxidant and cognitive enhancing effects. Ginger, or <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, a plant in the family of <italic>Zingiberaceae</italic>, has longterm been used as both a spice and as a medicine in Asian, Indian, and Arabian folklore. The rhizomes of <italic>Zingiber officinale </italic>exhibit a wide range of pharmacological properties including antilipidemia [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], antiemetic [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], anti-inflammation, and antiarthritis [<xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. According to Arabian folklore, ginger has been claimed to improve memory. Moreover, it has also been traditionally used as an ingredient for cognitive enhancement. Our preliminary data in Wistar rats showed that ginger rhizomes extract could enhance memory and protect against brain damage [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. In addition, it was also reported to have antioxidant effects [<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Based on the antioxidant and cognitive enhancing effects of ginger rhizomes extract, the present neuropsychological and electrophysiological study aims to determine the effect of ginger rhizomes extract on the cognitive function of middle-aged women.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Materials and Methods</title><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Participants</title><p>Sixty healthy, Thai, middle-aged women (mean age 53.40 &#x000b1; 3.57 years) were recruited to participate in the present study, which was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Medicine at Khon Kaen University. Prior to investigation, each volunteer provided informed consent and completed the medical health questionnaire. Participants were also screened for physical health by a physician in order to assure healthy condition. Inclusion criteria were healthy, middle-aged, Thai National women between the ages of 50 and 60 residing in the Northeast Region of Thailand. Exclusion criteria included any history of cardiovascular disease, respiratory disease, neuropsychological disease, head injury, diabetes, cancer, alcohol addiction, and anyone who smoked more than 10 cigarettes per day because all mentioned conditions could produce the disturbance of cognitive function. Individuals taking prescribed, nonprescribed drugs, or nutraceutical compounds known to influence the function of the nervous system were excluded. Participants were randomly divided into 3 separate groups: placebo, <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>&#x02009;&#x02009;400&#x02009;mg, and <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> 800&#x02009;mg.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2. The Preparation of the Standardized Extract of <italic>Zingiber officinale </italic>
</title><p>A standardized extract of <italic>Zingiber officinale </italic>was prepared by the Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research in Pathum Sthani, Thailand. Standardization and conformity of the extract were assured by strict in-process controls during manufacture and complete analytical control of the resulting dry extract. In brief, the dried ginger rhizome powder was extracted with 95% ethanol in a stainless steel tank for 5 to 10 days. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness under a vacuum at 35&#x000b0;C on a rotary evaporator. The production yield of the extract was 6.84% w/w. The phenolic compound of standardized ginger extract contained 7.33% w/w of 6-gingerol and 1.34% w/w of 6-shogaol.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.3"><title>2.3. Procedures and Treatments</title><p>This study was 2 months in duration and was double blind, placebo controlled, and arranged with randomized trials. A random list of numbers was computer-generated. After being randomly assigned to treatment groups, each participant received one capsule of either the placebo or ginger extract (400 or 800&#x02009;mg) once daily. The selected doses of <italic>Z. officinale</italic> are based on the dosage range that produces cognitive enhancing effect in animal model and the safety range. The placebo and ginger capsules had the same color, texture, size, and odor. All participants were screened for baseline intellectual function using standard progressive matrices (SPMs) in order to avoid confounding error induced by the intellectual function problem. Participants were assessed for cognitive performance after 1 and 2 months of treatment. According to the evaluation, all experimenters and staff were instructed to follow a strict protocol and were told not to discuss any issues related to the use of medication. The medication compliance was monitored by interview and counting the remaining medication, and the side effect was assessed via interview, self-report, and physical exam in each visit. Subjects were requested to call the study center if they experienced any medical problems during the 60 days of study duration. At the end of the study, they were also asked about any adverse experiences.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Event-Related Potentials (ERPs)</title><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.4.1"><title>2.4.1. ERP Recording</title><p>All subjects were assessed for cognitive performance using the classic &#x0201c;oddball paradigm&#x0201d; of auditory event-related potentials (N100 and P300 amplitudes and latencies) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. The electroencephalogram (EEG) was recorded via Cz, and linked mastoids were used as reference for the electrode. The resistance of the electrodes was kept below 5&#x02009;kohm. The analog filter band pass was 1&#x02013;100&#x02009;Hz [<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. For each stimulus, an epoch of 500&#x02009;ms duration including a 100&#x02009;ms prestimulus period was extracted from the continuous EEG. Epochs with a voltage change below 0.1&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>V or above 70&#x02009;<italic>&#x003bc;</italic>V were rejected from further analysis.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsubsection" id="sec2.4.2"><title>2.4.2. ERP Measurement</title><p>The subjects listened to a train of tone bursts presented binaurally through headphones. The standard stimuli had a tonal frequency of 650&#x02009;Hz (60&#x02009;dB, 200&#x02009;ms) and occurred with a tonal frequency of 80%. The target stimuli had a tonal frequency of 1&#x02009;kHz (60&#x02009;dB, 200&#x02009;ms) and occurred with a probability of 20%. All participants were informed to pay attention and mentally count infrequent target tones. Interstimulus intervals varied randomly between 1250 and 3000&#x02009;ms. The N100 latency range was determined to be 65&#x02013;135&#x02009;ms, and the P300 latency range was determined to be 280&#x02013;375&#x02009;ms. Both the latency and maximum amplitudes were measured for N100 and P300 deflections. Any peaks outside of this range were measured manually, and all peaks were visually examined prior to measurement.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.5"><title>2.5. Computerized Assessment Battery Test</title><p>The computerized assessment battery test was modified from the CDR computerized assessment battery test used in hundreds of European and North American drug trials which have been previously reported to be sensitive to acute cognitive improvements as well as impairments with a wide variety of substances [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Presentation was performed using notebook computers with a high-resolution VGA colour monitor, and, with the exception of written word recall tests, all responses were recorded via a two-button (yes/no) response box. The entire selection of tasks took approximately 20&#x02009;min. Tests were administered in the following order: word presentation, picture presentation, simple reaction time, digit vigilance task, choice reaction time, spatial working memory, numeric working memory, delayed word recognition, and delayed picture recognition. </p><p>
<statement id="head1"><title>Word Presentation</title><p>Fifteen words, matched for frequency and concreteness, were presented in sequence on the monitor for the participant to remember. The stimulus duration was 1&#x02009;s, as was the interstimulus interval.</p></statement>
</p><p>
<statement id="head2"><title>Picture Presentation</title><p>A series of 20 photographic images was presented on the monitor at the rate of 1 every 3&#x02009;s, with a stimulus duration of 1&#x02009;s, for the participant to remember.</p></statement>
</p><p>
<statement id="head3"><title>Simple Reaction Time</title><p>The participant was instructed to press the &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; response button as quickly as possible every time the word &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; was presented on the monitor. Fifty stimuli were presented with an interstimulus interval that varied randomly between 1 and 3.5&#x02009;s. Reaction times were recorded in milliseconds.</p></statement>
</p><p>
<statement id="head4"><title>Digit Vigilance Task</title><p>A target digit was randomly selected and constantly displayed to the right of the monitor screen. A series of digits was presented in the centre of the screen at the rate of 80/min, and the participant was required to press the &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; button as quickly as possible every time the digit in the series matched the target digit. The task lasted 1&#x02009;min and there were 15 stimulus-target matches. Task measures were accuracy (%), reaction time (milliseconds), and false alarms.</p></statement>

<statement id="head5"><title>Choice Reaction Time</title><p>Either the word &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; or the word &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; was presented on the monitor, and the participant was required to press the corresponding button as quickly as possible. There were 50 trials of which the stimulus word was chosen randomly with equal probability, with a randomly varying interstimulus interval between 1 and 3.5&#x02009;s. Reaction times (millisecond) and accuracy (%) were recorded.</p></statement>
</p><p>
<statement id="head6"><title>Spatial Working Memory</title><p>A pictorial representation of a house was presented on the screen with four of its nine windows lit. The participant was instructed to memorize the position of the illuminated windows. In 36 subsequent presentations of the house, one of the windows was illuminated, and the participant decided whether or not this matched one of the lighted windows in the original presentation. The participant made their response by pressing the &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; response button as quickly as possible. Mean reaction times were measured in milliseconds, and the accuracy of responses to both original and novel (distractor) stimuli was recorded as percentages used to derive a &#x0201c;percentage greater than chance performance&#x0201d; score.</p></statement>

<statement id="head7"><title>Numeric Working Memory</title><p>Five digits were presented sequentially for the participant to hold in memory. This was followed by a series of 30 probe digits for each of which the participant decided whether or not it had been in the original series and pressed the &#x0201c;yes&#x0201d; or &#x0201c;no&#x0201d; response button as appropriate and as quickly as possible. This was repeated two further times with different stimuli and probe digits. Mean reaction times were measured in milliseconds, and the accuracy of responses to both original and novel (distractor) stimuli was recorded as percentages that were used to derive a &#x0201c;percentage greater than chance performance&#x0201d; score.</p></statement>

Discussion</title><p>The present study clearly demonstrates that <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> may enhance both the attention and cognitive processing in middle-aged women. Our event-related potential and computerized battery test (for assessing working memory) data showed that the improvement of cognitive function was observed in all attention and cognitive processing domains. During the last decade, numerous lines of evidence point out that event-related potential (ERP) components are sensitive to the attention and working memory demand of a task [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>, <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Previous studies show that stimuli that require active discrimination between classes of events typically evoke a large positive voltage deflection in the interval between 300 to 500&#x02009;ms following the stimulus onset, which is known as P3 or P300 [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. This component corresponds to mental processes such as recognition, categorization of stimuli, expectancy, or short-term memory. The amplitude of this wave is correlated with individual differences in working memory capacity [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. P300 latency is regarded as a measurement of relative timing of the stimulus valuation process, indicating stimulus evaluating time [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Numerous brain regions including the temporal lobe, parietal lobe, and hippocampus have been proposed to be involved in its generation [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Recent findings show that the N100 reflects the process of attention activation, analysis of information based on the physical characteristics of sound, and the formation of memory trace with oscillators in the auditory cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and cingulate cortex [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Moreover, the amplitude of N100 was also reported to be associated with enhanced memory performance [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], attention [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], expectancy [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], and tasks involving short-term memory [<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>].</p><p>Several studies have also suggested that the high power of attention represents the intensity of concentration at a particular moment, with faster responses reflecting a higher focus of attention. It has been reported that the power of attention can be evaluated in choice reaction time and digit vigilance tests while the continuity of attention is also able to be evaluated using the % accuracy tests mentioned earlier. In addition, the speed and quality of memory are also evaluated by using the reaction time and % accuracy of numeric working memory, spatial memory, and word/picture recognition [<xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>With regard to the assessment of working memory via the computerized battery test in accompany with the assessment of brain activity during cognitive performance, our results show that <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> could enhance both attention and the efficiency of cognitive processing. However, the alteration in attention appears to be more sensitive to the effect of the plant extract rather than the cognitive processing. Previous studies report that the lateral prefrontal cortex (PFC) plays an important role in executive function such as planning, regulating behavior, and finding solutions to novel problems. Moreover, this area also contributes to the significant role of numeric working memory and is also critical for picture and word recognition process [<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>, <xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Recent findings also suggest an important role of the hippocampus in spatial working memory [<xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. In addition, it was found that dopamine, and norepinephrine play a key role in numeric working memory including word and picture recognition (organized by the lateral PFC), while acetylcholine and serotonin in the hippocampus simultaneously were activated during spatial working memory tasks [<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>
<italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> was previously reported to enhance the level of norepinephrine, epinephrine, dopamine and serotonin contents in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus [<xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. Moreover, this plant extract and its active component, 6-gingerol, also inhibited the cholinesterase activity which in turn increased acetylcholine (ACh), a neurotransmitter that plays an important role in learning and memory [<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. A recent study demonstrated that ginger extract enhanced the memory performance induced by cerebral ischemia by decreasing infarct volume in both cortical and subcortical areas [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Therefore, taking all data together, we suggest that the cognitive enhancing effects of <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> might be partly associated with the modulation effect of this plant extract on the alteration of both the monoamine system and the cholinergic system in various brain areas, including the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus.</p><p>Recent accumulating lines of evidence show that antioxidants could also improve cognitive performance in healthy elderly subjects [<xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]; therefore, the association between the antioxidant effects of <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> and the cognitive enhancing effects still cannot be excluded [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>According to the cognitive enhancing effects of substances possessing antioxidant activity, the concentration of gingerol and shogaol of the extract, and the antioxidant activity of <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic>, we suggest that the cognitive enhancing effect of this plant extract on working memory observed in this study might be partly related to its antioxidant effect. However, the precise underlying mechanism and possible active ingredient responsible for the cognitive enhancing effect of <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> still require further investigation.</p><p>Although the side effect of <italic>Z</italic>. <italic>officinale</italic> extract is rare which is corresponding with our data [<xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>], some minor adverse effects at higher doses such as gastrointestinal disturbance, sleepiness, restlessness, sedation, and heartburn were also reported [<xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Moreover, the extract could therefore also possibly interact with medications including anesthesia, anticoagulants, and analgesics leading to arrhythmias, poor wound healing, bleeding, photosensitivity reaction, and prolonged sedation [<xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>, <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Therefore, the application in the mentioned conditions should be performed with caution.</p></sec><sec id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The present study demonstrates that ginger extract enhances both attention and cognitive processing capabilities of healthy, middle-aged women, with no side effects reported. Therefore, our data reveal that <italic>Zingiber officinale</italic> extract is a potential brain tonic to enhance cognitive function for middle-age women (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, further study about the precise underlying mechanism especially the effect of the extract on the alteration of acetylcholine and monoamine transmitters should be performed.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was supported by The Integrative Complimentary Alternative Medicine Research Group, Khon Kaen University and Graduate School, Khon Kaen University, and Thailand Institute of Scientific and Technological Research, Pathum Thani.
