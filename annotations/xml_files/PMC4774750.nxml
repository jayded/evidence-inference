Fecal egg count was were determined to confirm the occurrence of nematodosis. Diets were formed by using crushed maize, soybean meal, de-oiled rice bran; in detail, T2, T3, and T4 diets contained 70% of total digestible nutrients and 16%, 20% and 24% of DCP, respectively.

The values were increased throughout the experiment possibly due to flock grazing. Especially, T3 have significantly (p&#x0003c;0.01) lower values than T1 and T2 groups suggesting that the supplementation influenced the rate of larval development in the kids. It might also be an effect of resistance and/or resilience increase against nematodes due to higher protein supplementation level.

However as the level of protein supplementation increased, the Hb content also increased after the 30<sup>th</sup> day of the experiment, especially after the 45<sup>th</sup> day. In the present study, a reduction in Hb content was observed, possibly as a result of either blood loss due to blood-sucking by larvae and adults [<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] or due to mucosa damage [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>].

experiment; in general, T3 and T4 had higher values compared to T1 and T2 group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table-2</xref>). TLC value increased as the levels of infection and incubation period increased, possibly as a result of parasitic infection. Qamar [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported that TLC values were significantly affected by the extent of nematode parasitosis. In the case of parasitized animals that are supplemented with proteins, the number of eosinophils and other leukocytes, mast cells and proteases released from the mast cells increased in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract [<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. TLC showed a significantly increased value in small ruminants naturally infected with parasites [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The mean values of TEC significantly differed (p&#x0003c;0.05, p&#x0003c;0.01) among the experimental groups during the experiment apart from the day 0 to 15 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table-2</xref>).

Abdel Hameed <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] reported higher TEC values in diets supplemented with different level of protein in Sudan desert lambs compared to other experimental diets.</p><p>The mean PCV values significantly differed (p&#x0003c;0.01) among the experimental groups during the entire period apart from day 0 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table-2</xref>). On day 30, 45, and 60, T3 showed the highest and T1<sup>th</sup>e lowest values compared to T2 and T4 group, possibly as a result of the improved nutrition of the parasitized animals. The higher dietary protein improved the erythropoiesis or reduced the establishment or development of adult nematodes. The kids on the higher protein diet even with heavy infection better able to resist the adverse effect of gastrointestinal nematodosis. Al-Rekani [<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>], Esmaeilnejad [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] also reported decreased values of PCV in infected compared to control animals.</p><p>The influence of protein supplementation level on monocyte and neutrophil values are also presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table-3</xref>. No significant differences were found among the treatments. The values of monocytes did not follow any specific trend and in the case of neutrophil; there was a decreasing but not significant trend in T2, T3, and T4. Esmaeilnejad <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that neutrophil counts were significantly increased with the increase of parasitemia rates in natural parasitic small ruminants, a finding that

The highest values were constantly showed by T1 and lowest by T3 group. The results of the present study might be due to the chronic infection of nematodosis resulting in the exhausted immune system. Esmaeilnejad <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] reported that number of lymphocyte increased significantly in natural parasitic small ruminants which were in accordance with the present findings.</p><p>As presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table-3</xref>, eosinophil count was significantly influenced by protein supplementation apart from day 0. The eosinophil count was higher in T1 followed by T2, T4 and T3. It has already been suggested that eosinophil count may provide an index of protective immune response of animals to parasitism [<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. With increase in parasitemia rates, eosinophil count shows a significantly increased value in small ruminants with natural parasitic infection [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p><p>The average values of MCV, MCH, and MCHC of the experimental groups are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table-4</xref>. The MCV values were higher in T3 and T4 compared to other groups on days 30, 45 and 60. The MCH values were higher in T3 and T4 compared to T1 group on days 45 and 60. No significant differences in MCHC values were found among the groups. However, the values were decreased as the time period and level of infection increased. The present findings of MCV and MCH were supported by previous studies in goats infected with parasites [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. However, in contrast with the present study, MCV appeared to slightly increase with increase in worm load in cattle affected by fascioliasis [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Abdel Hameed <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also reported higher values in diets with different level of protein supplementation in Sudan desert lambs compared to other experimental diets which were in accordance with present findings. MCHC showed no reasonable change with increase in worm load in cattle affected with fascioliasis [<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Reduced level of MCHC with the increase in infection was also observed in small ruminants with natural parasitic infection [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. At the same time, higher values of MCHC were recorded in diets with different level of protein supplementation in Sudan desert lambs compared to other experimental diets [<xref rid="ref17"

dietary supplementation with different levels of protein in goats with subclinical nematodosis had significant beneficial effects on reducing the worm egg count and on improving hematological profile
