Therefore, effective diabetes mellitus management in this group requires a comprehensive, multidisciplinary, and individualized approach. In addition, the lack of large, well controlled trials makes it difficult to determine which treatment options would benefit the majority of patients; thus, most recommendations were extrapolated from data in the non-elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Two more recent published guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>] are evidence-based.</p><p>The population of older adults with diabetes is expected to increase due to the rise in obesity, changing lifestyle, and the increase in the overall life expectancy of the United States (US) population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. It is estimated that 33&#x000a0;% of nursing home residents have diabetes and 40&#x000a0;% of the population is presumed to be prediabetic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. This growing disease burden represents a large public health concern since diabetes complications are more common and costly in older individuals who have lived with diabetes longer and are more vulnerable to hypoglycemia than younger patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. Nonetheless, recommendations for glycemic targets in the elderly are not exclusively driven by immediate clinical benefits but are also intended to prevent the untoward effects of pharmacotherapy, particularly hypoglycemia.</p><p>Currently, there are limited published data regarding basal insulin analog use in older adults, although basal insulin is the most common and effective recommended first step in initiating insulin therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Some studies suggest that insulin therapy in the elderly is underutilized despite available data showing that insulin therapy, particularly insulin analog therapy, is both safe and effective in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>This publication presents an exploratory sub-analysis of efficacy and safety, particularly as it relates to the incidence of hypoglycemia and adverse events (AEs), in patients aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years and &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years who were treated with the basal insulin analog, insulin detemir (Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Denmark), in the investigator-led arm of the PREDICTIVE<sup>&#x02122;</sup> 303 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. This arm was chosen for analysis because it more closely reflects the typical practice, where most patients have their basal insulin levels adjusted by their physicians rather than adjusting it themselves. The goal of this analysis was to gain insight into the outcomes for glycemic control in patients aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years compared with patients younger than 65 and whose insulin dosing was not self-managed, somewhat similar to what might occur in long-term institutional settings.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>This exploratory post hoc sub-analysis of the PREDICTIVE 303 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] examines the efficacy and safety of insulin detemir in patients with type 2 diabetes who were stratified by age into two groups, aged &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;1915) and &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years (<italic>n</italic>&#x000a0;=&#x000a0;897), and designated for investigator-led titration regimens during the 26-week trial period. Patients with type 2 diabetes, aged &#x02265;18&#x000a0;years, HbA<sub>1c</sub> (A1C) &#x02264;12&#x000a0;%, and mean body mass index (BMI) &#x02264;45&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were eligible for enrollment regardless of their diabetes treatment regimens. Data included in this post hoc sub-analysis were for patients who received only one dose of insulin detemir per day. The trial was approved by institutional review boards, and all participants enrolled in the trial provided written informed consent.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Trial Design and Treatment</title><p>Patients were encouraged to maintain contact with their physician throughout the trial. All subjects participated in a screening/baseline visit and follow-up visits at Weeks 12 and 26 and received a glucose meter (OneTouch<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> UltraSmart<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> Milpitas, CA, USA: LifeScan Inc) and test strips, with appropriate instructions for use. All glucose measurements performed with capillary blood were automatically calibrated by the meter to plasma-equivalent glucose values. Insulin detemir was supplied in the FlexPen<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> (3&#x000a0;mL, 100&#x000a0;U/mL, Bagsvaerd, Denmark: Novo Nordisk A/S) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>].</p><p>Insulin detemir was the only basal insulin used throughout the trial. The protocol recommended insulin detemir to be injected once daily in the evening at approximately the same time each day. Throughout the trial, patients performed self-measured fasting plasma glucose (SMFPG) before breakfast on the last 6 days prior to each scheduled visit. Physicians determined the initial dose of insulin detemir based on the manufacturer&#x02019;s instructions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] and adjusted the dose during the trial according to their standard-of-care practice. During the first 12 weeks, only the dose of insulin detemir was to be titrated; in the final 14 weeks, investigators were encouraged to adjust all medications taken to treat diabetes, including prandial insulin doses, where appropriate.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Assessments</title><p>The main outcomes for efficacy were A1C and the change in A1C from baseline to the end of the 26-week treatment period. Change in A1C was analyzed only for patients with A1C values measured at baseline and at 26 weeks. Additional outcome variables included FPG, body weight, and final insulin detemir dose (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab2" ref-type="table">2</xref>). The safety analysis set (SAS) included all patients who took at least one injection of insulin detemir after the baseline visit and reported any safety information.</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Statistical Analyses</title><p>A 2-sided <italic>t</italic> test with Welch&#x02019;s correction was used for comparisons between age groups with respect to changes from baseline for A1C, FPG, body weight, and insulin dose. The safety data collected included adverse events and hypoglycemic events.</p><p>In the main PREDICTIVE<sup>&#x000ae;</sup> 303 trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>], hypoglycemic events were defined as (a) symptoms of hypoglycemia that resolved with oral carbohydrate intake, glucagon, or intravenous glucose, and (b) any symptomatic or asymptomatic blood glucose &#x0003c;56&#x000a0;mg/dL (&#x0003c;3.1&#x000a0;mmol/L). Nocturnal hypoglycemic events were defined as those occurring between 2300 and 0600&#x000a0;hours. Severe hypoglycemia was defined as an episode of hypoglycemia during which the patient was unable to self-treat.</p><p>Differences in hypoglycemia rates between groups were analyzed using a Poisson regression model with a log-link function and the logarithm of the time period in which a hypoglycemic episode was considered treatment emergent as offset. All relative risk ratios were adjusted for the reported total number of&#x000a0;years the patient was exposed to the drug in order to correct for exposure. SAS for Unix (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA), and GraphPad Prism, version 6 (GraphPad Software, La Jolla, CA, USA), were used for data analyses.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec7"><title>Demographics</title><p>Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref> lists the baseline demographic characteristics of patients in the post hoc analysis trial.

Baseline hypoglycemia rates were low for both age groups. Hypoglycemia rates decreased significantly within each age group, but there were no significant differences in changes in hypoglycemia rates from baseline between the groups. This is a clinically meaningful finding and should encourage the use of basal insulin in the elderly patient population.</p><p>The low hypoglycemia rates for the group aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years were maintained despite improvements in A1C. Body weight changes amounted to small, but non-significant decreases between the two age groups. This lack of weight gain while achieving improved A1C values is important, especially in light of the more typical weight gain observed with insulin use. Final insulin dose was only slightly higher in the group aged &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years compared with the group aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years. The difference in mean change in dose between the two age groups was statistically significant, but not clinically relevant. Adverse events related to treatment occurred at similar rates in both age groups.</p><p>This post hoc analysis included some limitations. First, the trial was not evenly randomized in terms of each group having equal numbers of patients. Second, there was no randomization for comorbidities and baseline glucose parameters. Lastly, investigators were encouraged to adjust any medication taken to treat diabetes during the last 14 weeks of the trial, including prandial insulin doses. This could have confounded the results since the number of patients requiring this intervention may have been different between age groups. Nevertheless, the results of this sub-analysis support the use of insulin detemir in the elderly population with type 2 diabetes. Physicians successfully titrated insulin detemir to patients aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years with similar safety and improvements in efficacy seen in patients aged &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years.</p><p>The results of this current sub-analysis are similar to other published analyses. A post-hoc analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] conducted on data pooled from three phase III trials comparing insulin detemir and NPH insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] suggested that insulin detemir can reduce A1C levels with less hypoglycemia and less weight gain in both older and younger persons with type 2 diabetes. A post-hoc analysis of the original INITIATE<italic>plus</italic> trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] demonstrated that biphasic insulin aspart 70/30 was well tolerated and effective in patients with type 2 diabetes aged &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years and &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. The addition of insulin glargine to current oral anti-diabetic (OAD) therapy for patients &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years with poor glycemic control was as effective as increasing the dose of the OAD and demonstrated lower hypoglycemia risk in this patient population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. These studies support the use of insulin analogs in older patients with type 2 diabetes.</p><p>There are few evidence-based studies from which treatment guidelines for elderly patients can be derived. The current recommendations are intended to individualize treatment plans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The risk of hypoglycemia among patients with type 2 diabetes aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years is possibly more serious than in a younger population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Therefore, glycemic control in patients aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years must be carefully balanced with safety, especially hypoglycemic risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p>The results of this subanalysis support the use of once-daily basal insulin in lowering A1C and FPG while demonstrating a low rate of hypoglycemia and no weight gain. In addition to meeting the needs of patients with type 2 diabetes who are aged &#x0003c;65&#x000a0;years as demonstrated in earlier trials, this analysis showed that basal insulin may be a viable option for those aged &#x02265;65&#x000a0;years and should be considered earlier in the course of diabetes rather than being reserved for the latter stages of the disease.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin detemir according to physician-led dose titration showed no differences in efficacy or hypoglycemia rate changes as a function of age.
