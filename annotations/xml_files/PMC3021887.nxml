This study assessed these effects of rimonabant in Asian population. A total of 643 patients (BMI 25&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or greater without diabetes) from China, Republic of Korea, and Taiwan were prescribed a hypocaloric diet (600&#x02009;kcal/day deficit) and randomized to rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg (<italic>n</italic> = 318) or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 325) for 9months.

Introduction</title><p>Overweight and obesity, a global phenomenon,  affects more than 1 billion adults, with 300 million being clinically obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. With changing life styles and dietary patterns, obesity is rapidly increasing in epidemic proportions globally. In the national nutritional surveys of the 3 countries that participated in the RIO-Asia study, the obesity prevalence rates were at 14.7% in China [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>], 26.6% in Taiwan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>], and 30.6% in Korea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>] in the year 2001-2002.  </p><p>Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder characterized by an imbalance in energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>], abnormal development of adipose tissue, and deregulation of hormones and cytokines including adipocytokines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. This chronic metabolic imbalance is associated with comorbidities such as cardiovascular disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>], hypertension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], sleep apnea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>], diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>], and certain types of cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] and related morbidity/mortality. Besides weight loss and favorable cardiometabolic profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>], pharmacological interventions for obesity should address reduction in abdominal obesity and lower the risk of developing diabetes mellitus.</p><p>G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptor, CB-1 of the endocannabinoid system (ECS), plays a crucial role in regulating feeding pattern, lipid metabolism, and energy homeostasis. CB-1 receptors are located in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues including adipocytes, pancreas, gut, liver, and muscle  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Rimonabant is a selective CB-1 antagonist drug to be developed for weight loss. Results of in vitro experiments have suggested the involvement of fourth and fifth transmembrane domains of the CB-1 receptor for high-affinity binding of rimonabant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>]. Rimonabant has been shown to exert a peripheral effect on food intake by regulating Acrp30 (i.e.,  adiponectin) and insulin, hormones involved in lipid and glucose metabolism, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. The mechanism of the long-lasting weight loss through rimonabant may be associated with an increase in energy expenditure and/or metabolic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>].</p><p>Animal studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] and human trials have demonstrated the efficacy of rimonabant in inducing weight loss and improving dyslipidemia and insulin sensitivity. The RIO-Europe [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>] and RIO-North America [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>] clinical trials studied the weight loss in obese or overweight Caucasians treated with 20&#x02009;mg rimonabant. At the end of a 1-year period, the weight loss was significantly greater in patients treated with rimonabant (&#x02212;6.3 to &#x02212;6.6&#x02009;kg; <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001 versus placebo, &#x02212;1.6 to &#x02212;1.8&#x02009;kg). The proportion of patients who achieved 5% or greater decrease in body weight was 48.6&#x02013;50.9% while a 10% or greater decrease was noted in 25.2&#x02013;27.4% patients. A reduction in waist circumference (3.6&#x02009;cm) and triglycerides (13.2%), as well as an increase in HDL-cholesterol (7.2%), was also observed in the rimonabant group. After 2 years of treatment with 20&#x02009;mg rimonabant, the weight loss was maintained at 7.4&#x02009;kg. Similar results were observed in the RIO-Lipid study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>] which analyzed the efficacy of rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg in overweight or obese Caucasians with dyslipidemia. A significant suggestion of the study was that in addition to weight reduction, rimonabant also mobilized abdominal fat and improved cardiovascular risk profile. Furthermore, although the adiponectin-elevating effect was indirect, it was independent of weight loss.</p><p>The efficacy of rimonabant in Asian ethnicity has not yet been evaluated. Evidence shows that the incidence of obesity is increasing rapidly in Asian countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. As stated above, Asian populations have a greater body fat content at a lower body mass index (BMI) compared with Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. Consequently, obesity-related metabolic disorders like dyslipidemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes are more frequently observed at lower BMI in Asians than in Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. Hence, the WHO has redefined the classification of obesity based on BMI in Asians. The BMI cutoff was lowered in Asians to &#x02265;23.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for overweight and &#x02265;25.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for obesity compared to 25&#x02013;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> for overweight and &#x02265;30 kg/m<sup>2</sup> for obesity in Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. </p><p>The RIO-ASIA study evaluated the efficacy and safety of rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg, along with a hypocaloric diet, in reducing weight and improving cardiometabolic risk factors in obese Asian population.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec2"><title>2.

Study Design</title><p>This phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multinational study was carried out in 32 centers in China (<italic>n</italic> = 240), Republic of Korea (<italic>n</italic> = 200), and Taiwan (<italic>n</italic> = 203) between April 2006 and April 2007.</p><p>After a screening period of 7 to 14 days, obese patients were randomized in a 1&#x02009;:&#x02009;1 ratio to treatment with rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg  (<italic>n</italic> = 318) once daily or placebo (<italic>n</italic> = 325) for a 9-month period. Randomization was stratified based on BMI status at baseline as 25 to 27&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> or &#x0003e;27&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>. Follow-up visits were scheduled every 28 days throughout the study duration. Study participants were prescribed at baseline a hypocaloric diet for the study duration. The calorie requirement was calculated based on basal metabolism rate and physical activity, from which 600&#x02009;kcal/day was subtracted to calculate the recommended diet. A food intake assessment was carried out on day 84, day 168, and day 252 from diet diary entries. The protocol, approved by the Institutional Review Boards/Ethics Committees for each centre, was conducted in compliance with the Helsinki Declaration and with an independent, unblinded data monitoring committee. All patients provided written informed consent.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.2"><title>2.2.

Measures and Assessments</title><p>The primary efficacy endpoint was the absolute weight change from baseline (randomization) to 9 months in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population. Secondary efficacy endpoints were waist circumference (as a marker of change in abdominal obesity), high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol, triglycerides, fasting insulin, and glucose.</p><p>Measurement of body weight was carried out at each visit using a calibrated scale. Based on established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>], 3 waist measurements were taken in centimeters at the midpoint between the lower rib margin and the iliac crest. The variations in these measurements were expected to be &#x02264;1.0&#x02009;cm. Failure to fit within these criteria would lead to a fourth measurement. Metabolic parameters, including glucose, insulin, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides, were measured under fasting conditions on day 84, day 168, and day 252 in a central laboratory. Safety assessments consisted of spontaneously reported adverse events, clinical examinations, laboratory tests, vital signs, and electrocardiograms.</p></sec><sec sec-type="subsection" id="sec2.4"><title>2.4. Statistical Analysis</title><p>The sample size calculations for the study were derived from the RIO-Europe study and were based on a test to compare the mean change in weight (primary variable) and HDL-cholesterol (secondary confirmatory variable) from baseline between the 2 groups. The calculations of sample sizes were done using the sample size software nQuery Advisor 4.0. Thus with a standard deviation (SD) of 6.5&#x02009;kg, 200 randomized patients (100 patients/group) were required to detect a mean treatment difference of 3&#x02009;kg in weight. For HDL-cholesterol change, with a common SD of 25%, 414 randomized patients (207 patients/group) were required to detect a mean treatment difference of 8% in HDL-cholesterol. Finally, to fulfill the country/region requirements for the number of exposed patients, a total of 640 patients had to be randomized (320 patients/group).</p><p>Statistical analysis was performed using SAS version 8.2 or higher. All statistical tests were 2-sided at the 5% significance level. Efficacy analyses were performed in ITT population, which consisted of all randomized patients and was the primary population for efficacy analyses.</p><p>The absolute change in body weight from baseline to 9 months was analyzed using a 3-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model, which included 3 fixed effects&#x02014;treatment, country/region, and randomization stratum&#x02014;and 1 covariate, baseline weight. Rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg was compared with placebo using a Student's <italic>t</italic>-test within the framework of the ANCOVA model. In addition, a 95% confidence interval (CI) was constructed for the difference in mean absolute weight changes between the groups. </p><p>Patients who achieved a 5% or 10% reduction in body weight from baseline at 9 months were classified as 5% or 10% responders. The proportion of 5% or 10% responders in the rimonabant 20-mg group was compared with placebo using a logistic regression model with 3 fixed effects&#x02014;treatment, country/region, and randomization stratum&#x02014;and 1 covariate, baseline body weight.</p><p>Secondary efficacy endpoints were analyzed at 9 months using the ITT population. With the exception of the lipid parameters, continuous secondary efficacy endpoints were assessed as the absolute change from baseline at 9 months. Lipid parameters, except total cholesterol/HDL-cholesterol ratio, were assessed as relative change from baseline and analyzed as described for the other secondary end points.</p><p>In the efficacy analyses of endpoints for the ITT population, the last observation carried forward method (LOCF) was used to account for missing assessments or patients who prematurely discontinued. These endpoints were replaced by the last available postbaseline on-treatment observation.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec3"><title>3.

Discussion</title><p>This 9-month RIO-Asia study showed that rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg is effective in reducing body weight in obese Asians. The 9-month treatment period with rimonabant was considered to be sufficient to compare the efficacy and safety of rimonabant with placebo, based on the results from previous RIO studies. A significantly greater reduction in weight was observed in the rimonabant 20-mg group compared with the placebo group (&#x02212;2.99&#x02009;kg, <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .0001). </p><p>The percentage of patients who achieved at least 5% (53.0%) and 10% (20%) reduction of their baseline body weight with rimonabant treatment at 9 months was more than twice (21.5%) and four times (5.7%) compared with placebo. In obesity, a 5% decrease in body weight is associated with an improved cardiometabolic profile  [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>The reduction in waist circumference followed the same pattern as body weight reduction.

Since rimonabant decreased the mean waist circumference by 2.8&#x02009;cm, reduction in abdominal obesity would also lower the risk of developing related metabolic disorders.

Hence, the results of this study indicate that treatment with rimonabant would have favourable effects on body weight and cardiometabolic risk profile in obese Asians who are known to have a greater incidence of obesity-related metabolic disorders at a lower BMI as compared with Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>].</p><p>The results in this RIO-Asia study are consistent with those in the 4 previous double-blind, placebo-controlled RIO studies (RIO-Lipids, RIO-Europe, RIO-Diabetes, and RIO-North America) conducted in more than 6000 patients, where rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg had shown a significant reduction in body weight at 1 year compared with placebo (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001 versus placebo). In Rio-Asia, the mean decrease in weight induced by rimonabant, compared with placebo, in the ITT population was 2.99&#x02009;kg which was lower than RIO-North America (5.2&#x02009;kg), RIO-Europe (5.3&#x02009;kg), and RIO-Lipids (6.0&#x02009;kg) on day 252 (data on file). The lower mean loss in body weight in the RIO-Asia study could be attributed to the lower baseline weights in Asian study population (81.48&#x02009;kg) as compared with the Caucasian populations in the other studies (93.2&#x02013;102.7&#x02009;kg), but the percentage change in the weight loss was comparable among the different studies.</p><p>In this study, similar results for weight loss was observed across both BMI strata (25&#x02013;27&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and &#x0003e;27&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Rimonabant decreased weight by 5.61% in the group with a BMI 25 to 27&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and by 6.11% in the group with a BMI &#x0003e; 27&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, which can lower the risk of developing related metabolic disorders. Metabolic disorders are initiated at a lower BMI in Asians compared with Caucasians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]. The BMI cut-off points for overweight and obesity are different in the Asian population as compared with the Caucasian population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]. In the IDEA study, which involved 177, 345 patients in 63 countries, one half to two thirds of the study population were overweight or obese (BMI &#x02265; 25&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>). The frequency of diabetes mellitus and coronary vascular disease increased with waist circumference in all categories of BMI (&#x0003c;25&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, 25&#x02013;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>, and &#x0003e;30&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In adult Korean population, the incidence of diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia was 2 times more at a BMI of 23.0 to 24.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> and 3 times more at a BMI of 26.0&#x02009;kg/m<sup>2</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. In Chinese population, the inclination to accumulate truncal body fat is associated with metabolic complications, which occur at a lower BMI than in European/North American populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>].</p><p>Safety evaluation in this study found that rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg was generally well tolerated in the Asian study population. The most common adverse events reported with an incidence &#x02265;2% in the rimonabant group were upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, diarrhea, dyspepsia, vomiting, dizziness, depression, anxiety, insomnia, hyperhidrosis, palpitations, and fatigue. In addition, a lower number of patients discontinued treatment due to adverse events and this number was comparable between the 2 treatment groups (3.1% versus 2.8%, in rimonabant and placebo group, resp.). Among neuropsychiatric events, depression (4.1%, <italic>n</italic> = 13) and anxiety (3.8%, <italic>n</italic> = 12) were higher in the rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg compared to placebo (0.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 3 and 1.5%, <italic>n</italic> = 5). A meta-analysis of randomized trials involving rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg/day has proposed that rimonabant increases the risk of psychiatric adverse events including depression and anxiety. Patients were 2.5 and 3.0 times more likely to discontinue rimonabant due to depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. An overview of the RIO programme with rimonabant was published recently, which reviewed and summarized the overall efficacy and side effects of RIO trials including RIO-Europe, RIO-North America, RIO-Lipids, and RIO-Diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. The vast majority of the test populations are western ethnics. The overall TEAE-induced drug discontinuation rate was higher in the rimonabant than the placebo groups either without (13.6% versus 7.7%, resp.) or with diabetes (15.0% versus 5.5%, resp.). The reported AE of depression was increased in the rimonabant group, either in all obese cohort (3.9% versus 1.7%, resp.) or in diabetes programme (2.5% versus 1.4%, resp.). The TEAE-induced drug discontinuation rate in RIO-Asia seems to be much lower than that of other RIO trials. Although the RIO-Asia has relatively a smaller sample size and shorter duration than other RIO trials, the reported AE of depression rate is still significantly increased in the rimonabant group in Asian population. Hence, monitoring of rimonabant-induced psychiatric adverse events is essential.</p><p>The endocannabinoid system (ECS), encompassing endocannabinoids including  anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), two cannabinoid receptors, type 1 (CB1) and type 2 (CB2), and enzymes responsible for endogenous ligand synthesis (phospholipase D) and degradation (fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH)), is a complex physiological system involved in metabolic homeostasis such as modulating energy fluxes and nutrients  regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>]. Recently, substantial clinical evidence revealed that CB1 antagonists might result in risks of severe psychiatric problems, including depression, anxiety, and stress disorders, especially in those with underlying or susceptible psychological problems. These findings have made rimonabant (SR14176A), the first CB1 inverse agonist approved and launched in Europe in 2006, withdrawn from the market in 2008, and thereof, several CB1 target-related candidates including taranabant (MK-0364) and otenabant (CP-945598) were suspended at the late clinical development stage (phase III). In the meanwhile, increased evidence indicates that CB1 receptors present in the peripheral tissue, including fat and liver, might regulate food intake and energy balance as effectively as those present in the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>]. This provides a rationale for development of peripherally preferred or restricted CB1 antagonists which possess minimized CNS adverse reactions and preserve antiobesity effects. Recently, this strategy of developing CB1 antagonists without penetrating blood-brain barrier (BBB) was found to meet with a certain degree of success. Sufficient weight-reduction efficacy and less CNS toxic profile have been observed with romonabant-mimicking analogues acting exclusively on peripheral CB1 receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. However, these compounds have been tested only in animals.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec5"><title>5. Conclusion</title><p>The RIO-ASIA study of 9-month duration confirmed the efficacy of rimonabant 20&#x02009;mg on weight reduction in the Asian population. Besides the favourable effect on weight, significant improvements were also observed in waist circumference, HDL-cholesterol, and triglycerides. The drug was associated with a good safety profile in the Asian study population, which was consistent with the pattern observed in the Caucasian population. However, in patients with a history of psychiatric disorder, especially those with a past history of depression, the usage of rimonabant is not recommended owing to mild yet considerable increase of psychiatric untoward side effects observed in this trial as well as other such similar trials. In addition, the psychiatric status of patients taking rimonabant has to be monitored regularly, preferably using a practical risk evaluation form such as the Columbia classification algorithm of suicide assessment (C-CASA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Perceptively, to avoid untoward CNS side effects in drug discovery for the intervention of the endocannabinoids system, an appealing strategy of development of peripherally restricted and highly CB1/CB2 selective antagonists may be desired. Some compounds of this kind have been shown to have promising results in lowering propensity to pass the blood-brain barrier with preserved weight-reducing effects in DIO mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Another peripheral-acting CB1 neutral antagonist has been shown to have weight-independent effects on improving cardiometabolic risks and fatty liver in mouse models of obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>].  However, the clinical efficacy and safety of these new antiobesity compounds are yet to be seen.</p></sec><sec sec-type="section" id="sec6"><title> Conflict of Interests </title><p>The authors declared no conflict of interests.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>Dr. L.
