Se intake or status has been linked to the occurrence of pre-eclampsia by our own work and that of others. We hypothesised that a small increase in the Se intake of UK pregnant women of inadequate Se status would protect against the risk of pre-eclampsia, as assessed by biomarkers of pre-eclampsia. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, pilot trial, we randomised 230 primiparous pregnant women to Se (60&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/d, as Se-enriched yeast) or placebo treatment from 12 to 14 weeks of gestation until delivery. Whole-blood Se concentration was measured at baseline and 35 weeks, and plasma selenoprotein P (SEPP1) concentration at 35 weeks. The primary outcome measure of the present study was serum soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (sFlt-1), an anti-angiogenic factor linked with the risk of pre-eclampsia. Other serum/plasma components related to the risk of pre-eclampsia were also measured. Between 12 and 35 weeks, whole-blood Se concentration increased significantly in the Se-treated group but decreased significantly in the placebo group. At 35 weeks, significantly higher concentrations of whole-blood Se and plasma SEPP1 were observed in the Se-treated group than in the placebo group. In line with our hypothesis, the concentration of sFlt-1 was significantly lower at 35 weeks in the Se-treated group than in the placebo group in participants in the lowest quartile of Se status at baseline (<italic>P</italic>=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;039). None of the secondary outcome measures was significantly affected by treatment. The present finding that Se supplementation has the potential to reduce the risk of pre-eclampsia in pregnant women of low Se status needs to be validated in an adequately powered trial.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Selenium</kwd><kwd>Pre-eclampsia</kwd><kwd>Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1</kwd><kwd>Pregnancy</kwd><kwd>Selenoprotein P</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta><notes><p><bold>Abbreviations:</bold> CRP, C-reactive protein; GPx, glutathione peroxidase; PIH, pregnancy-induced hypertension; PlGF, placental growth factor; SEPP1, selenoprotein P; sFlt-1, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1</p></notes></front><body><p>Overall, 10&#x000a0;% of women have high blood pressure during pregnancy and 2&#x02013;5&#x000a0;% will develop pre-eclampsia, a serious hypertensive condition associated with high maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality<sup>(</sup>

<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">

To allow for a 15&#x000a0;% dropout, we planned to recruit 115 subjects per group, making a total of 230 subjects. It subsequently came to light that an error had been made, in that the standard deviation of 0&#x000b7;2&#x000a0;ng/ml was actually the standard error, resulting in the present trial being underpowered to detect a difference in the sFlt-1 end-point.</p><p>Using the observed difference in means between the Se-treated and placebo groups and the measured standard deviation in both groups, we have now calculated the true power of the present study to achieve two-sided significance at the 5&#x000a0;% level when comparing the means of sFlt-1 in the two arms of the study to be 10&#x000a0;% overall and 36&#x000b7;8 and 54&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;% for women in the bottom tertile and quartile of Se status, respectively. As neither power level is adequate to achieve a significant effect of treatment, we have redefined the present study as a pilot trial.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-9"><title>Randomisation</title><p>Centralised randomisation was performed by the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit Clinical Trials Unit, University of Oxford. The randomisation schema was created using the subroutine ralloc.ado (version 3.5.2) in Stata software (version 10.1). Treatments were allocated in the ratio of 1:1 using permuted block randomisation with variable block sizes of 2, 4 and 6 (seed used: 221010). Block sizes were allocated proportional to the elements of Pascal's triangle.</p><p>A third party, Pharma Nord, who were not involved in any way in the recruitment of participants for the trial, provided the treatment tablets. Pharma Nord was notified of the allocation sequence by an independent statistician at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit, and packed eight blister strips of twenty-eight tablets into plain white boxes.</p><p>The pharmacist at the John Radcliffe Hospital held and dispensed the boxes, each of which bore a label with a unique pack identification number. Each blister pack within each box also bore the randomisation number. The packs were collected by the research midwife from pharmacy as required. A log was kept which, on dispensing the packs, was signed by two people, the research midwife and pharmacist or nurse prescriber. The pack label was also signed before giving the trial box to each participant.</p><sec id="sec1-9-1"><title>Blinding</title><p>Apart from the independent statistician at the National Perinatal Epidemiology Unit who generated the sequence, all study personnel and the participants were blinded to allocation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-10"><title>Assessment of compliance</title><p>Compliance was assessed by tablet count. Stamped, addressed envelopes were provided to participants who were instructed to return empty/partially used/unused blister packs by post to the research midwife who recorded the number of tablets taken. The midwife contacted those who failed to return the packs from the previous 4 weeks within 10&#x000a0;d of the expected return date by telephone. To assess compliance, the total number of study tablets reported as having been taken was expressed as a percentage of the number of days between the study consent date and the date of giving birth. Participants were deemed to be compliant if they took 80&#x000a0;% of their study tablets.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-11"><title>Rationale for an approach to data analysis</title><p>We observed a large and significant reduction (12&#x000a0;%) in whole-blood Se concentration from 12 to 35 weeks in the placebo group in the present study, resulting, at least in part, from the increase in plasma volume that occurs over the course of normal pregnancy<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref55" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>55</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup>. We found that we could mitigate this dilution effect by correcting Se concentration by haematocrit, which reduced the decline in the concentration of Se in the placebo group to 7&#x000a0;%. Therefore, this adjustment was made in some of the analyses as explained below.</p><p>As the earlier study on which the present pilot trial was based<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref41" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>41</sup>
</xref>
<sup>)</sup> showed a significantly higher incidence of pre-eclampsia in women in the bottom tertile of toenail Se than in the rest, analyses in subgroups with low baseline Se status were the pre-specified primary analyses. As the earlier study and this trial used different matrices (toenail Se and whole-blood Se, respectively) and toenail cuttings reflect Se status before pregnancy, we endeavoured to determine the equivalent baseline whole-blood Se cut-off point in pregnant women to that used for toenail Se (bottom tertile cut-off point 0&#x000b7;547&#x000a0;mg/kg) in the previous study. Using the data from Behne <italic>et al.</italic>

<sup>)</sup> and taking the density of whole blood to be 1&#x000b7;06&#x000a0;kg/l, we calculated the equivalent whole-blood Se cut-off point to be 106&#x000b7;5&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/l. As pregnancy causes an expansion of blood volume from the non-pregnant state, the equivalent whole-blood Se cut-off value would be 95&#x000b7;1&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g/l, assuming that the increase was the same as that observed in plasma volume at 12 weeks of gestation, i.e. 12&#x000a0;%<sup>(</sup>
<xref rid="ref57" ref-type="bibr">
<sup>57</sup>

<sup>)</sup>. This value represents a cut-off between the bottom third and the bottom quarter of baseline whole-blood Se. Therefore, we examined the treatment effect in both the bottom quartile and the bottom tertile of Se status by blood Se concentration at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><sec id="sec1-12-1"><title>Intention-to-treat analysis</title><p>None of the dependent variables was normally distributed, nor was baseline Se; therefore, they were log-transformed to facilitate parametric testing. Thus, medians (ranges) or geometric means and their 95&#x000a0;% CI, computed by back transformation of log values, are reported. All analyses of continuous data used one observation per subject in a general linear model (SAS PROC MIXED), with treatment (Se or placebo) as the independent variable. Additional covariates were included as appropriate. These covariates were log baseline blood Se (adjusted or unadjusted for baseline haematocrit) and log baseline haematocrit. The treatment effect was assessed using the LSMEANS and PDIFF options of this SAS statistical procedure.</p><p>The pre-specified primary data analysis of this study was carried out on the subgroup of women with low Se levels at recruitment (the lowest third or the lowest quarter). Subgroups with low Se status (quartiles and tertiles) were defined as blood Se concentration at baseline divided by haematocrit concentration at baseline.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-12-2"><title>Sensitivity analysis</title><sec id="sec1-12-2-1"><title>Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 by compliance</title><p>The analysis was repeated including only those women who had taken 80&#x000a0;% or more of their trial tablets.</p></sec></sec><sec id="sec1-12-3"><title>Exploratory subgroup analyses</title><sec id="sec1-12-3-1"><title>Soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 by Se quartile at baseline</title><p>Quartiles of baseline blood Se and treatment were simultaneously contrasted to determine whether a trend could be observed across quartiles.

Even in mice with normal Se status, maternal plasma SEPP1 concentration fell rather dramatically in late pregnancy with a sharp rebound the day after delivery. Therefore, pregnancy may be putting similar pressure on the Se stores of UK pregnant women with marginal Se status. Women supplemented with Se had at least partial correction of their Se deficiency, raising the SEPP1 concentration, though most participants did not reach the maximum value (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="sec3-2"><title>Per-protocol analyses</title><p>sFlt-1 was the primary outcome measure of the present study, and our hypothesis was that there would only be an effect of Se supplementation in pregnant women of inadequate Se status.

Therefore, it is important that we found a significant difference in participants in the lowest quartile of Se status at baseline, in whom Se treatment lowered the concentration of sFlt-1 by 30&#x000a0;% (ratio of means 0&#x000b7;70, 95&#x000a0;% CI 0&#x000b7;49, 0&#x000b7;98; <italic>P</italic>=&#x000a0;0&#x000b7;039; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab3">Table 3</xref>).

If the effects that we observed are attributable to GPx, then only a subgroup of women in the present study could have benefited from Se supplementation, as observed by our group.

Supplementation with Se from 12 to 35 weeks was insufficient to raise the concentration of SEPP1 to that plateau level in the majority of women in the Se-treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Fig. 2</xref>).
