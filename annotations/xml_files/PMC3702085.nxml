The definition of hyperuricemia was based on analyses from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref30">30</xref>]</p><p>Hypertension was defined as systolic BP of 140 mm Hg or higher, diastolic BP 90 mm Hg or higher; or combined factors of diagnosed with high BP and using antihypertensive medication.</p><p>Exclusion criteria were malignant HTN due to Erythropoietin therapy diagnosed with cancer, alcohol consumption, noncompliance with taking prescribed medication and those patients with a known history of hypersensitivity to allopurinol or being already on allopurinol. Each participating patient gave written informed consent before enrollment in the study.</p><p>Fifty-five patients meet the inclusion criteria, hence, their BP were measured before and after each session of HD for the eight months duration of the study. To prevent any observer bias at the time of measuring BP, the nurse in charge was prevented from knowing which patients were under treatment of allopurinol.</p><p>BP was measured by a calibrated mercury sphygmomanometer in the dialysis ward, after the patients were at the sitting and relaxed position for 10 min. The mean of all weekly measurements for systolic and diastolic BP, before and after HD, was used for analysis.</p><p>During the study, the antihypertensive therapies, as well as lipid-lowering drugs such as (ACE inhibito, &#x000e2; blocker, Ca channel blocker and inhibiting HMG-CoA reductase) were kept constant.</p><p>In patients, who were taking antihypertensive medication, the class and dosage of medication were extracted from their records.</p><p>Patients were randomly divided into two groups, each of which went through two phases. In the first phase of the study, Group-1received 100 mg/day of allopurinol, Hakim Pharmaceutical Company of Iran, for three months; while Group-2 was given whatever medication they received prior to enrollment into the study.

Our study has found that reducing hyperuricemia decreases BP, while decreasing KT/V in HD patients. Uric acid is a pro-inflammatory factor,[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref55">55</xref>] so reducing uric acid to normal level may have anti-inflammatory effect. This may be the reason for improvement of KT/V in our study population. Hence, management of hyperuricemia may prevent HTN and consequently reduce CV events.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature that shows the benefits of allopurinol therapy on BP in hyperuricemic patients who are under HD treatment.</p><p>For further confirmation of the findings, we suggest studies with larger sample size. We also recommend studies to be conducted to access the effect of early treatment with allopurinol on patients with normal BP, as an important part of a prevention regime for any kind of vascular events in ESRD patients.</p><sec id="sec2-6"><title>Limitation of this study</title><p>One of the main limitations of this study was avoidance of placebo.</p><p>Also, it is important to note that the results of our study may be confined by the concurrent use of antihypertensive drugs by patients. However, we agree that our sample size was too small to allow us to make concrete conclusion.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>Iran's Zanjan University of Medical Sciences supported this work.
