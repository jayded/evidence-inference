The aim of this study was to determine the size of any patient survival benefit from such interactive case-based learning method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>] aimed at facilitating implementation of guidelines in primary care.</p><p>This was a prospective randomized controlled trial in a primary care practice setting, in Stockholm, Sweden. New guidelines for secondary prevention in coronary artery disease were mailed to all general practitioners in the area and presented at a common lecture in 1995. The general practitioners were randomized according to their Primary Health Care Center into well-matched patient/physician pairs and were randomly allocated to active intervention with either exposure to a case-based learning method or usual care. General practitioners in the intervention group participated in recurrent case-based learning dialogues at their Primary Health Care Centers during a two-year period. A locally well-known cardiologist served as the facilitator. Consecutive patients (n=255) with coronary artery disease were included. Ten-year mortality rates were obtained from the <italic>Cause of Death</italic> register and were assessed as all cause and cardiovascular mortality.</p><p>The two Primary Health Care Center groups of patients and physicians were well matched and did not differ at baseline. The attendance rate at the seminars was 82% or higher. After ten years, nineteen (44%) of the patients included in the control group had deceased compared to 10 (22%) in the intervention group (p=0.017; log rank test). The inclusion of the covariates age, sex, hypertension, smoking and diabetes did not change the results. Patients treated by a specialist died at a rate comparable to the intervention group (23%). Cardiovascular mortality was 32% in the control group and 16% in the intervention group (p=0.007).</p><p>In conclusion, case-based learning methods for general practitioners improved survival in patients with coronary artery disease. The hazard ratio (HR) of survival between intervention and usual care is 0.45 (95% CI 0.20-0.95) if the case-based learning method is used to assist implementation of evidence based care.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="book"><name><surname>Mauffette-Leenders</surname><given-names>LA</given-names></name><name><surname>Erskine</surname><given-names>JA</given-names></name><name><surname>Leenders</surname><given-names>MR</given-names></name><article-title>Richard Ivey School of Business.
