Further, hypertension accounts for nearly 45% of the global burden of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality <xref rid="pone.0110131-Ezzati1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref>. Hypertension is one of the most common modifiable risk factor for CVD, with a prevalence of nearly 57% in adults 40 years and older in Tibet <xref rid="pone.0110131-Li1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, two times as high as the 2002 China national rate <xref rid="pone.0110131-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>. This preponderance of hypertension has been strongly associated with an extreme burden of stroke in Tibetans. The Tibetan age-standardized stroke incidence was 450.4 per 100,000 persons and stroke mortality of 370.2 per 100,000 persons; both metrics were over four times the respective China national rates <xref rid="pone.0110131-He1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref>.</p><p>The high prevalence of hypertension in Tibetans is attributable to a very high level of daily dietary salt intake <xref rid="pone.0110131-Tian1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110131-Sehgal1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref>.

Reduction in salt intake has been identified by the World Health Organization as a highly cost-effective strategy for cardiovascular disease prevention <xref rid="pone.0110131-Murray1" ref-type="bibr">[14]</xref>.</p><p>Low sodium salt substitute, as a low cost strategy to reduce sodium intake, has previously demonstrated marked reductions in systolic blood pressure among Han Chinese patients with high cardiovascular risk in the China Salt Substitute Study (CSSS). The magnitude of the effect was significantly associated with the baseline blood pressure of the CSSS cohort <xref rid="pone.0110131-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. We set out to test the hypothesis that the low sodium dietary salt substitute could be more effective in reducing blood pressure in community hypertension programs in Tibetans living at high altitude, whose prevalence of hypertension as well as salt intake are markedly higher than Han Chinese <xref rid="pone.0110131-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110131-Tripathy1" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref>.</p><p>Of particularly note, the high altitude as the special regional living condition could actually cause significant difficulties to the local healthcare system in implementing hypertension prevention and control program as well as other health programs, such as lack of health care workers, remote and low access to health care services and medications, etc. Thus, the prevalence, treatment and control of hypertension in Tibet are very low <xref rid="pone.0110131-Zhao1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>.

If the invitee&#x02019;s systolic blood pressure was confirmed &#x02265;140 mmHg again, regardless use of anti-hypertension medications, he/she would be invited to participate in this study. Of 287 patients who met our inclusion criteria, 282 were recruited after excluding 5 patients who met the exclusion criteria, including 1 patient who was too old and weak to travel, 1 patient who withdrew after inform consent, and 3 patients dropped by research staff due to their living far and arduous journey for follow up.

Our study staff delivered study salt to these families and then called for the study participants living nearby to come to pick up the study salt. This gave us the opportunity to measure the salt container at these families and ask the questions to help us estimate relatively accurate the amount of salt consumption in these families. For the selected household, we weighted the amount of study salt delivered to the household at baseline and the amount of remaining study salt at the follow-up to estimate average daily salt consumption per person. A total of 54 (27 in each group) families had complete and accurate salt consumption data and reported not using other salt (e.g. crude salt locally available, and/or salt bought from stores). The estimated average daily sodium chloride intake was 20.0&#x000b1;5.4 grams in the salt substitute group versus 26.9&#x000b1;8.1 grams in the regular salt group (p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.025). The additional potassium chloride intake is estimated at about 7.7&#x000b1;2.1 grams in the intervention group. Comparison between participants who did and did not have salt consumption data showed no significant difference in age, gender, blood pressure, education, smoking and alcohol drinking except for those with no data of salt consumption had a significantly lower proportion in use of anti-hypertensive drugs (48.5% vs. 64.8%, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.022).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Discussion</title><p>The present study demonstrated a significantly reduction in both SBP and DBP in salt-substitute group (by 7.6/3.5 mmHg in ITT analysis), which is expectedly even greater than what we found in China Salt Substitute Study (CSSS) conducted in rural Han Chinese, where a 5.4 mmHg reduction in SBP and no significant reduction in DBP were shown <xref rid="pone.0110131-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. The result should be attributed most likely to higher blood pressure at baseline, but also markedly higher dietary salt intake, simpler diet and lower access to medical treatment in the Tibetan cohort in the present study in comparison to the CSSS&#x02019;s Han Chinese cohort. Blood pressure reduction effect of an intervention is usually directly related to the baseline level of blood pressure, this is shown in many blood pressure lowering drug trials as well as non-drug trials such as DASH and CSSS <xref rid="pone.0110131-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110131-Banach1" ref-type="bibr">[21]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110131-Sacks1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref>. Compared to CSSS in which the baseline SBP/DBP was 159/93 mmHg, the baseline blood pressure in our study was much higher (177/105 mmHg). Furthermore, salt consumption for participants in our study was very high at about 27 grams per day but is about 15 grams in the CSSS study populations <xref rid="pone.0110131-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110131-Zhou1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref>. The Tibetan diet is simpler, characterized by low consumption of fresh vegetables and fruits, and high meat and fat. There are evidences that a diet with rich fruits and vegetables could be beneficial to blood pressure lowering <xref rid="pone.0110131-Appel1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0110131-Moore1" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>. Compared with diets of CSSS study participants, the diet of Tibetan study participants was much simpler and lacked components that might be helpful in lowering blood pressure. At last, CSSS found that the blood pressure reduction effect of salt substitute was lower among patients with blood pressure lowering agents <xref rid="pone.0110131-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>. It is understandable that use of anti-hypertension medications would diminish the BP lowering effect from salt substitute through highly possible interactions. While 61% of study participants were having blood pressure medications in CSSS <xref rid="pone.0110131-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, it was only 47.0% in the present study. With smaller possible interaction with drugs, in comparison with CSSS, our study hence would have greater effect in lowering blood pressure. In this study, the significant reductions of both SBP and DBP were also found in the control arm receiving regular salt. These changes could be attributable to regression to the mean as well as the seasonal variations in blood pressure since the present study was conducted from February to May mirroring the expected temperature progression. This temperature associated variance phenomenon in BP has been previously reported by our group&#x02019;s experience in the CSSS and many other prior reports <xref rid="pone.0110131-Group1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110131-Alperovitch1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0110131-Woodhouse1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>.</p><p>In addition, we also found that blood pressure lowering agents use was lower in intervention group than in control group, though not statistically significant. This suggests the effect of salt substitute in lowering blood pressure demonstrated in the study would not be attributable to differential use of anti-hypertension medications. We believe that our observed effect would have an even higher magnitude if the use of anti-hypertension medications had been the same in both groups. The salt consumption data showed that the intervention group consumed 7 grams less sodium chloride and 7.7 grams additional potassium chloride on average per day, which, we believe, drove the blood pressure reduction significantly more in intervention group.</p><p>Due to the imbalanced lost to follow up between intervention and control in terms of quantity and quality, we choose multiple imputations rather than baseline observations carried forward approach to impute the missing values in our ITT analysis. In fact, our intervention group lost more patients than control group (42 vs. 27 patients). Comparison of those lost in intervention and control showed that patients lost in intervention group had higher blood pressure (180.9 vs. 170.3 mmHg in SBP), less use of blood pressure lowering agents (42% vs. 50%), less women (29.6% vs. 70.4%), younger age (64.0 vs. 65.3 years) and higher BMI (23.6 vs. 22.8 Kg/m<sup>2</sup>) at baseline. Although the results from baseline observations carried forward approach showed a smaller net reduction in both SBP (&#x02212;5.9 mmHg) and DBP (&#x02212;2.7 mmHg) and could be significantly underestimated the real net reduction, our results of both approaches showing a significant net reduction in SBP/DBP argue strongly for the validity of our study conclusion.</p><p>In order for population wide health intervention to be successful in a limited resource setting such as rural Tibet, the intervention and its delivery should not require a tremendous bandwidth of healthcare and financial capital. Furthermore, there is great importance for the cultural considerations in the design of the intervention, as approach of dietary restriction or outright elimination of the cultural dietary staple Tibetan yak buttermilk tea from study populations&#x02019; diet would have been a difficult intervention to implement. However, with the dietary salt substitute, the intake of sodium was successfully modified by dietary replacement of normal salt and population education. Thus, dietary salt substitute intervention presented in this study has the tremendous potential for benefits to public health as an simple, low-cost, and effective interventional strategy for ameliorating the burden of hypertension related maladies in both limited resource settings (i.e. Tibet) and developed countries.</p><p>The present study was limited by restricted financial resources available and austere environmental conditions (remote and rugged terrain at an elevation of 4300 m with serious oxygen deficit); which lead to a single follow-up at three months post randomization and precluded the ability to collect and analyze urinary sample to measure changes in sodium and potassium excretion. However, the present study was a randomized controlled trial design, which would minimize the biases and provide reliable observed effects yielding strong internal validity. Also due to the resource constraints, we were only able to collect baseline data on age, sex, SBP, use of blood pressure lowering agents and BMI. The other variables such as education, occupation, smoking and alcohol drinking were only collected for part of study participants and thus not included in the analysis for adjustment. However, the high comparability between the Intervention and Control in terms of these variables indicates that not having these variables adjusted would not significantly affect the internal validity. Thirdly, the salt consumption data collected in this study does not include sodium from natural foods and is only from a small fraction of the total study population. It should only be used for a rough estimation of sodium intake for local Tibetans. If possible, future studies in Tibet should consider use of 24-hour urine or dietary recalls to get more reliable data. Fourthly, our definition of hypertension excluded those with isolated diastolic hypertension and thus it should be cautious to extend our findings to isolated diastolic hypertension patients. Lastly, mean blood pressure in control group also dropped significantly after intervention. It was due to either seasonal blood pressure change or regression to the mean. The &#x02018;white coat hypertension&#x02019; effect, if exist, should have been included in the regression to the mean. CSSS study had shown the similar seasonal blood pressure change where mean blood pressure reached the peak at the coldest season and the low ebb at the hottest season. However, our randomized parallel-controlled design well protected the validity of the study conclusion from the seasonal change and regression to the mean. Despite these limitations, this study was the first randomized control trial providing clear beneficial effects of salt substitute on blood pressure reduction in Tibet and area at high altitude.</p><p>In conclusion, this study confirmed the prior evidence of the blood pressure-lowering effects achieved with reduced sodium salt substitute in other trials. The excellent effect in lowering blood pressure achieved in this trial showed great potential of salt substitute in prevention and control of cardiovascular disease in this area and other similar settings in the world.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0110131.s001"><label>Protocol S1</label><caption><p>
