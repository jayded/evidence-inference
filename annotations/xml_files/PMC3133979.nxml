Group A patients were subjected to laparoscopic appendectomy (LA), whereas Group B patients were subjected to OA. Data regarding age, gender, and primary outcome measures, such as hospital stay, operative duration, and postoperative complication, were recorded and analyzed. Percentages were calculated for categorical data, whereas numerical data were represented as mean &#x000b1; SD. Chi-square test and t test were used to compare categorical and numerical variables, respectively.

Our hospital is a government hospital and majority of the patients attending it belong to lower socioeconomic group. LA is frequently practiced in our department. With not much regional studies comparing the two procedures, we endeavored to analyze and compare the LA and OA in terms of operative and postoperative outcomes.</p><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-1"><title>PATIENTS AND METHODS</title><p>This study was conducted at Khyber Teaching Hospital, Peshawar, from February 2008 to December 2009, as part of a single-center randomized clinical trial. The objective of the study was to compare LA and OA in terms of primary outcome measures, such as operative duration, length of hospital stay, and postoperative complications, as these are the ultimate determining factors in deciding between LA and OA. All other outcome measures, such as cost of the treatment of the two techniques, are regarded as secondary, and were not considered. Approval for the study was obtained from the Ethics Committee of the hospital.</p><p>In this study, 160 patients, presenting to outpatients department (OPD) with clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis were included. The diagnosis was made clinically with history (right iliac fossa [RIF] or periumbilical pain shifting to RIF, nausea/vomiting), physical examination (tenderness or guarding in RIF), and TLC (white blood cell (WBC) count &#x0003e; 10,000/dL). The clinical and laboratory data were used to calculate the Alvarado score of patients with MANTRELS (migratory pain, anorexia, nausea/vomiting, tenderness in RIF, rebound tenderness, elevated temperature, leukocytosis, and shift of WBCs). Any patient with a score of 7 or more was operated on as having acute appendicitis. Appendicitis was confirmed on histopathology, which also showed different grades of inflammation. The patients were selected through consecutive nonprobability sampling and were randomly allocated to two groups, A and B, using lottery method. Group A patients were subjected to LA and group B patients to OA.</p><p>The inclusion criteria were patients with clinical diagnosis of acute appendicitis, age 12&#x02013;60 years, American Society of Anesthesiologists Class I, informed consent, and willing to abide by the follow-up protocol. Patients with previous abdominal surgery, large ventral hernias, mass RIF, and history of symptoms for more than 5 days were excluded from the study. Patients with converted LA were included in the LA group (intention to treat principle). All the patients included in the study were admitted a day before surgery, as part of the routine protocol of our unit. History, physical examination and investigations, such as full blood count, urine routine examination, ultrasonography (US) of abdomen and pelvis, were performed for diagnosis. Once a diagnosis of acute appendicitis was made, investigations for anesthesia fitness, such as blood urea and sugar, serum electrolytes, chest radiography, Hepatitis B and C screening, and electrocardiography, were also performed. The patients were explained the risks and benefits of the two procedures and an informed consent was obtained.</p><p>The patients were operated by a single consultant surgeon, under general anesthesia, with sufficient capability of performing the two procedures (LA and OA). The patients were given, in both the groups, a prophylactic dose of third-generation cephalosporin and metronidazole at induction as part of the protocol, whereas two doses of the same were repeated postoperatively at 8 and 16 h.</p><p>LA was performed through a 3-port technique with carbon dioxide used for the creation of pneumoperitoneum through a 5-mm infraumbilical port up to a pressure of 12 mmHg. The other two ports were placed in the lower abdomen according to the individual surgeon's choice. After identification of the appendix, the mesoappendix was ligated, with Vicryl 1 after creation of a window in its base, and cut. The base of the appendix was crushed and ligated using Vicryl 1 endoloop. The appendiceal specimen was retrieved through a 10-mm infraumbilical port. Endodiathermy was used for hemostasis. OA was performed through standard Lanz incision. After the incision, peritoneum was accessed and opened to deliver the appendix, which was removed in the usual manner. Skin incision in both the procedures was closed with subcuticular prolene 2/0 suture.</p><p>The patients were not given oral feed until they were fully recovered from anesthesia and had their bowel sounds returned when clear fluids were started. Soft diet followed by regular diet was introduced when the patients tolerated the liquid diet and had passed flatus. Patients were discharged once they were able to take regular diet, afebrile, and had good pain control. A standardized questionnaire was used to record the data.</p><p>All the operative details were recorded. The operative time (minutes) for both the procedures was counted from the skin incision to the last skin stitch applied. Pain was measured qualitatively (subjectively) using visual analog scale. The length of hospital stay was determined as the number of nights spent at the hospital postoperatively. Postoperative complications were recorded in the proforma during the hospital stay and till 1 month (follow-up visit fortnightly in OPD). Wound infection was defined as redness or purulent or seropurulent discharge from the incision site observed within 30 days postoperatively. Seroma was defined as localized swelling without redness with ooze of clear fluid. Paralytic ileus was defined as failure of bowel sounds to return within 12 h postoperatively. Confounding variables were controlled through strictly following the exclusion criteria.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The data were analyzed using statistical package for social sciences (SPSS, version 11.0; Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables, such as age, hospital stay, and operative duration, were presented as mean &#x000b1; SD, while categorical variables, such as gender and postoperative complication, were expressed with frequency and percentages using 95% confidence interval. Student's <italic>t</italic> test was used to compare the means of continuous variables, while categorical variables were compared using Chi-square or Fisher's exact test, as appropriate. Probability equal to or less than 0.05 (<italic>P</italic> &#x02264; 0.05) was considered significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>A total of 160 patients were included in the study, 80 each in LA and OA groups, respectively.

However, OA is not lagging much behind LA and has flourished as a minimally invasive procedure due to the shorter and cosmetically acceptable incision. The advantages of LA over OA are thus, if any, only marginal and difficult to confirm.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>]</p><p>The clinical presentation of acute appendicitis can overlap significantly with other clinical conditions with only 50%&#x02013;60% of patients having the classical presentation.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] In our study, a majority of the patients with negative appendectomies, in both the groups, were females, which is corroborated by another study.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">15</xref>] The higher rate of misdiagnosis in females may be due to the gynecologic pelvic diseases and female functional abnormalities.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Therefore, in patients with atypical presentation, diagnostic laparoscopy instead of US, computed tomography, or serial WBC counts, should be considered early due to its easy availability, nil mortality, excellent diagnostic yield, and low morbidity.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>] This is one aspect where laparoscopic approach outshines the open approach.</p><p>This study shows that there was not a significant difference in the hospital stay between the two modalities of treatments. This is in corroboration with other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] Studies published in the early 1990s showed significantly shorter hospital stay in favor of LA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>] Similarly, a local study also demonstrated a significantly shorter hospital stay in the LA group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref>] Milewczyk <italic>et al</italic>. demonstrated a longer hospital stay in LA vs OA group.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref19">19</xref>] The question whether LA is associated with a shorter hospital stay has been a matter of controversy and the current literature yields conflicting data.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>] The difference in the hospital stay between the two procedures may be due to the difference in the health care system rather than the difference in the two procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] This appears to be one area where OA has fast caught up with LA.</p><p>Operative duration remains a much talked about aspect among experts whenever LA and OA are compared.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] This study shows that the operative duration was significantly longer in LA compared with OA, which is consistent with other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">18</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref22">22</xref>] Peiser <italic>et al</italic>. reported no significant difference in the operative duration comparing the two procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] All the procedures in our study were performed by a consultant surgeon with sufficient minimal invasive surgery load and the difference can be explained by the fact that LA involves the additional steps of gas insufflation, trocar entry, and diagnostic laparoscopy.</p><p>According to Johnson, a new procedure must have, in addition to other benefits, such as less operative time and ease in performance, the advantage of safety (less complications and morbidity).[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">23</xref>] In our study, the overall complication rate was significantly lower in LA compared with OA. This is in agreement with other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] Guller <italic>et al</italic>. did not find any statistically significant difference in the overall morbidity between the two procedures.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">20</xref>]</p><p>Wound infections may not be a serious complication as such but can cause inconvenience to the patient, impacting convalescence and quality of life.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] In this study, fewer patients developed wound infection in the LA group, but the difference was not statistically significant. Similar observations are reported from other national and international studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">14</xref>] In contrast to our results, a prospective study showed that a significant proportion of patients, undergoing OA, developed wound infection as opposed to LA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] In OA, direct delivery of the appendix through the wound may risk contamination, whereas utilization of laparoscopic port or bag for appendix retrieval may favor reduced frequency of wound infection in LA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In contrast, intraabdominal abscess formation is almost 3 times more common in LA compared with the open counterpart.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>] This can be attributed to the fact that CO<sub>2</sub> insufflation in LA may facilitate spreading of microorganisms in the peritoneal cavity, especially in perforated appendicitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref>] In the present study, however, no patient developed intraabdominal abscess.</p><p>In this study, 6.9% patients in the LA group and 1.3% patients in the OA group developed paralytic ileus, which did not reach statistical significance. This finding is mirrored in other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref24">24</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref26">26</xref>] Some studies have reported statistically significant postoperative ileus in LA arm compared with OA.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] Postoperative ileus along with pain and wound infection may hamper the mobility of the patient, in turn prolonging the hospital stay and increasing the cost of treatment.</p><p>Reduced postoperative ileus and wound infection can be beneficial in so many ways: less pain, early oral intake, early mobilization, all resulting ultimately in reduced hospital stay.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">25</xref>] In our study, we found that pain (overall level as measured on visual analog scale) was significantly less in LA, which is in accordance with other studies.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">21</xref>] In contradistinction with our results, other studies failed to show significant difference in pain perception between the two treatment options.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] Smaller incisions and minimal tissue handling may be the reason for decreased postoperative pain perception in LA.</p><p>It would be befitting to acknowledge the limitations of our study. First, we did not include residents as surgeons in the study, although appendectomy is commonly performed by residents in our setup. Second, our follow-up was limited to 1 month postoperatively. Our aim was to look for early postoperative complications postdischarge. Third, this study was not blinded (treatment allocation and clinical outcome assessment not being blinded).</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-4"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>In our study, postoperative pain was significantly less in the LA group. In contrast, operative duration was longer in LA, which touched statistical significance. There was, however, no difference in other primary outcome measures. In conclusion, LA is an equivalent procedure and not superior to OA in terms of primary outcome measures, as the benefit gained through reduced postoperative pain was balanced by significantly longer operative duration.</p><p>Based on the results of this study, firstly, we would like to recommend further trials comparing LA and OA not only for primary outcome measures assessment, but also for secondary outcome measures. Secondly, where the facilities and expertise are available for LA, the choice for treating acute appendicitis with any of the two modalities should finally be decided by the patient or the operating surgeon.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None
