Whilst gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB) are both currently used to treat CS, equipoise exists regarding their individual use. In particular, no head-to-head study of GBP and PGB in CS exists. Despite equipoise, most countries&#x02019; formulary regulatory authorities typically favour one drug for subsidy over the other. This hinders interchange wherever the favoured drug is either ineffective or not tolerated. The primary aim of this study is to conduct a head-to-head comparison of the efficacy of PGB versus GBP for CS based on outcomes on a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/design</title><p id="Par2">We are conducting a prospective, randomised, double-blind, double-dummy cross-over study.

Sciatica is a symptom defined as well-localised leg pain with a sharp, shooting or burning quality that approximates to the dermatomal distribution of the sciatic nerve down the posterior lateral aspect of the leg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. It is often associated with numbness or paraesthesia in the same distribution but typically extends beyond the limits of perceived pain in either a dermatomal or sclerotomal anatomical fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The term <italic>sciatica</italic> is used by clinicians in different ways: Some refer to any leg pain referred from the back as sciatica; others prefer to restrict the term to pain originating from the lumbar nerve root. Others believe sciatica is a form of &#x02018;neuropathic&#x02019; pain caused by compression or irritation of the roots or nerves that comprise the sciatic nerve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Chronic sciatica (CS) is sciatica which has been present for more than 3&#x000a0;months despite active conservative management, including physical therapy. CS may complicate previous chronic low back pain; however, it may also present purely as an isolated phenomenon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>].</p><p id="Par25">The annual prevalence of sciatica varies widely (1.6&#x02013;43%) with male predominance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Sciatica accounts for 5% of patients with low back pain presenting to primary care practices and 30% have persistent pain for longer than 12&#x000a0;months. Of these 30% presenting to primary care, 20% are already out of work, and 5&#x02013;15% require surgery. Over half of patients with sciatica will have pain 4&#x000a0;years post-diagnosis, and the socio-economic cost per country per year is estimated to be $128 million for in-hospital care, $730 million for absenteeism and $708 million for disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par26">Anti-depressants such as tricyclic anti-depressants (TCAs; e.g., amitriptyline) are widely used to treat neuropathic pain (NP), including CS, as first-line therapy after failure of simple analgesics. On the basis of &#x02018;moderate-quality&#x02019; evidence, The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence &#x02013; United Kingdom (NICE-UK) reported TCA efficacy over placebo for NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]; however, on the basis of &#x02018;high-quality&#x02019; evidence, TCAs were also significantly more likely than placebo to produce side effects (SEs). Extrapolating NICE-UK guidelines, prescribing authorities (e.g., Australian Therapeutic Guidelines [ATG]) often insist on trialling TCAs first for NP prior to introducing second-line agents. Limited information, however, is available regarding TCA use in CS. In one rare cross-over study, nortriptyline&#x02014;alone or combined with morphine&#x02014;had no significant benefit over placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p id="Par27">Anti-convulsant anti-neuropathic agents such as gabapentin (GBP) and pregabalin (PGB) are also widely used to treat NP, including CS. On the basis of &#x02018;moderate- to high-quality&#x02019; evidence, NICE-UK noted the efficacy of these agents over placebo for NP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Australian prescribing authorities (e.g., ATG) recommend anti-neuropathic agents as second-line agents for NP, even though NICE-UK did not actually favour TCAs over anti-neuropathics as first-line agents (or vice versa). However, NICE-UK states that when introducing second-line agents, &#x02018;overlap&#x02019; with pre-existent regimens should be considered to avoid decreased pain control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. A recent literature review provides information on the individual efficacy of PGB and GBP over placebo for CS; however, when compared head-to-head, no firm conclusions can be made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par28">In summary, sciatica, like most NP states, often proves resistant to simple analgesic regimens (including paracetamol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs] or opioids) and recommended first-line TCAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Instead, the drugs most commonly used currently in both CS and NP are GBP or PGB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. PGB and GBP are both analogues of &#x003b3;-aminobutyric acid, a substance known to modulate calcium channel subunits. Both GBP and PGB may therefore possibly act by decreasing neurotransmitter release associated with central sensitisation in both CS and NP.</p><p id="Par29">As with NP, there is currently an absence of high-grade evidence regarding the medical treatment of CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. No adequately powered direct &#x02018;head-to-head&#x02019; trials comparing either PGB or GBP with other drugs are extant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Indirect comparisons, using placebo as the common comparator, have been published; however, each has represented differing patient populations, differing primary outcomes and differing pain measurement scales [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. Authors of a recent review concluded, albeit based on weak evidence, that efficacy and SEs with GBP and PGB were probably similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par30">Notwithstanding this information, citing minor titration but definite cost advantages, NICE-UK nevertheless favoured PGB over GBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, costs of either PGB or GBP vary widely globally. Moreover, costs vary unpredictably (i.e., PGB more expensive than GBP or vice versa) on a global basis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Despite this, formulary regulatory authorities in most countries have, like NICE-UK, favoured one drug over the other. Furthermore, and somewhat paradoxically, formulary regulatory authorities in most countries have typically favoured the more expensive drug, whether GBP or PGB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. For example, GBP is currently available on the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) in Australia and some hospitals in the United Kingdom only for epilepsy; it is not listed for NP. PGB, by contrast, is subsidised on the PBS for NP. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration, along with Health Canada, have adopted reimbursement criteria similar to that of the Australian PBS; notwithstanding this, both GBP and PGB can be accessed in the United States and Canada via special access schemes (if patients satisfy stringent criteria for NP). In marked contrast, GBP is listed for use in treating both partial seizures and NP throughout Europe. The rulings of formulary regulators have therefore been inconsistent and dependent upon the individual body. Such action hinders interchange wherever the favoured drug is either ineffective or not tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Given that no evidence supports unhindered PGB-GBP interchange and that no study has directly challenged GBP and PGB head-to-head, neither GBP nor PGB should probably be favoured, given current evidence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>].</p><p id="Par31">Prospective &#x02018;head-to-head&#x02019; studies are therefore urgently required to provide a robust evidence base for GBP or PGB use in sciatica [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Both medications have previously displayed efficacy when compared with placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. We therefore aimed to perform the first study to assess GBP and PGB directly head-to-head for treatment of CS.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Primary objective and outcome</title><p id="Par32">Our primary objective is to demonstrate if either GBP or PGB demonstrates superiority over the other in terms of efficacy for the treatment of patients diagnosed with CS. The co-primary outcome is leg pain intensity using a visual analogue scale (VAS) measured at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 10, 14 and 18. The participants will be asked to rate their average leg pain over the last 24&#x000a0;h on a scale of 10, with zero representing &#x02018;no leg pain&#x02019; and 10 representing the &#x02018;worst pain imaginable&#x02019; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par33">The co-primary outcome is the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], measured at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 10, 14 and 18, to assess disability. The Health Locus of Control Scale (HLOC) will also be used at baseline and at weeks 4, 8, 10, 14 and 18 to assess participants&#x02019; decision-making processes because we have identified compliance with these medications as being low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Secondary objective and outcome</title><p id="Par34">Our secondary objective is to demonstrate if one drug (i.e., either GBP or PGB) demonstrates superiority over the other in terms of the frequency and severity of SEs in the treatment of sciatica. The key secondary outcome will be the record of frequency and severity of SEs. Details of SEs will be collected at weeks 4, 8, 10, 14 and 18. The most common SEs of PGB are dizziness and somnolence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].

Medication packs pertaining to the PGB arm will have placebo incorporated as the lunchtime dose with all medications being indistinguishable.

As a result of the cross-over methodology, participants will have the opportunity to experience both PGB and GBP, and we predict little or no carry-over effects (medium- or long-term) after the washout period. We believe the incorporation of a stand-alone placebo arm is unethical in trials where participants with moderate to severe pain are recruited.</p><p id="Par56">The starting dose of PGB is 150&#x000a0;mg once daily for the first week. This will be titrated to the participant&#x02019;s optimal dose up to a maximum of 300&#x000a0;mg twice daily, depending on their progress and tolerance at each dose level. The starting dose for GBP is 400&#x000a0;mg once daily for the first week. This will be titrated to the participant&#x02019;s optimal dose up to a maximum of 800&#x000a0;mg thrice daily, depending on their progress and tolerance at each dose level. These doses are based on national recommendations from the Australian Medicines Handbook [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. In the standard study dosing regimen (Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>), we expect a 4-week titration period, after which the maximum tolerated dose for each participant will be maintained for 4&#x000a0;weeks before the first study medication is ceased in preparing for washout. The washout period between treatment phases will last 1&#x000a0;week, which is sufficient for these medications because they possess a short half-life (5&#x02013;7&#x000a0;h). The dosage of either PGB or GBP can be amended at any stage in PAGPROS on the basis of efficacy and/or SEs by communication between the study specialist and the study pharmacist. The maximum treatment period is 8&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>PAGPROS medication titration schedule</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th>Medication</th><th>Total daily dose</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Week</td><td>Pregabalin</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;1</td><td>1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150-mg capsule in the morning</td><td>150&#x000a0;mg/day</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;2</td><td>1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150-mg capsule three times daily (middle dose is placebo)</td><td>300&#x000a0;mg /day</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;3&#x02013;8</td><td>2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;150-mg capsules three times per day (middle dose is placebo)</td><td>600&#x000a0;mg/day</td></tr><tr><td>Week</td><td>Gabapentin</td><td/></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;1</td><td>1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;400-mg capsule in the morning</td><td>400&#x000a0;mg/day</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;2</td><td>1&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;400-mg capsule three times per day</td><td>1200&#x000a0;mg/day</td></tr><tr><td>&#x02003;3&#x02013;8</td><td>2&#x02009;&#x000d7;&#x02009;400-mg capsules three times per day</td><td>2400&#x000a0;mg/day</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><p><italic>PAGPROS</italic> Pregabalin and Gabapentin Prospective Clinical Trial for the Treatment of Sciatica: A Randomised, Double-Blind, Cross-over Study</p></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p id="Par57">The titration and dosage regimen are based on recommendations from clinical practice and medication guidelines such as the Australian Medicines Handbook and product prescribing information. Both medications have the potential for adverse neurological SEs, and hence a slow ascent in dose will contribute to mitigating this risk for participants and increasing compliance with the trial protocol. Simultaneously prior to washout, the dosage will be gradually reduced instead of being abruptly halted, further decreasing the likelihood of medication misadventures for the participants (and increasing compliance).</p><p id="Par58">In addition to PGB or GBP, participants may continue concomitant medications (including analgesics) as long as the dosage has been stable for 30&#x000a0;days prior to commencing the study period. These concomitant medications will be closely monitored and recorded in the case report form (CRF). Medicines for NP include anti-depressants, selective serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, topical lignocaine and other anti-convulsant medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Note that this practice is entirely consistent with NICE-UK guidelines, which state that when super-adding second-line agents for analgesic control (such as GBP and PGB), &#x02018;overlap with first-line agents is encouraged to avoid decreased pain-control&#x02019;. To our knowledge, only one prospective cohort study has reflected this practice with GBP in CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, participants should not take concomitant medication that could result in an adverse interaction with PGB or GBP, including medicines that might increase the risk of excessive sedation (for example, benzodiazepines) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. No other pain interventions will be permitted throughout the study period; if considered necessary, then such patients will be withdrawn from PAGPROS.</p><p id="Par59">Participating in PAGPROS is completely voluntary, and participants can stop taking part at any time without explanation or prejudice. Ceasing to participate in PAGPROS may be considered, for example, wherever participants wish to explore the possibility of other treatments, including other medications or interventions (<italic>see above</italic>). In some cases, participants may find that the starting dose of either PGB or GBP, whilst efficacious, produces unwanted SEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. In such cases, a lower dose may be required, at least for a period of time. Because this cannot be accommodated within the current PAGPROS protocol, such patients will be removed from the study, and their data will be analysed as per intention-to-treat (ITT) principles; however, they may still form part of a prospective cohort for parallel study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Data collection</title><p id="Par60">Data collection will be conducted by the study researchers via telephone, email or online at baseline (before medication commencement) and at weeks 4, 8, 10, 14 and 18. Week 10 data collection will act as the cross-over secondary baseline for analysis purposes. Data will be entered into CRFs by dedicated trained staff. Each participant will receive up to seven face-to-face or telephone consultations with the trial pharmacist to commence treatment, monitor progress and adjust the dose of the study medication over the 8-week treatment periods. These visits will also incorporate a medical evaluation and collection of primary and secondary outcomes. Participants will receive usual neurosurgical care independent of and parallel to PAGPROS.</p><p id="Par61">The use of prior and continued analgesic medicines will be collected at baseline. Adherence to study medication will be documented through a self-reported daily medication diary and by counting the returned medicine compared with the prescribed regimen as recorded by the trial pharmacist. Participants will be asked to return used and unused study medications at each visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Data integrity and analysis</title><p id="Par62">The integrity of trial data will be monitored by regularly scrutinising data files for omissions and errors. We will perform double data entry of the primary and key secondary outcomes. The source of any inconsistencies will be explored and resolved. Electronic data will be stored on a secure server, and paper copies will be locked in a cabinet. Data will be accessible only by researchers, and participant confidentiality will be maintained through secure password-protected data storage during and after PAGPROS.</p><p id="Par63">Data will be de-identified prior to statistical analysis, which will be performed on an ITT basis. Normality of data distribution will be assessed, and appropriate parametric (Student&#x02019;s <italic>t</italic> test or analysis of variance) or non-parametric (Wilcoxon signed-rank test, Wilcoxon rank-sum tests) tests for between-group differences will be performed. Statistical significance will be assessed at <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05. Subgroup analysis may be implicated and considered as PAGPROS develops. Time-to-event analysis will be undertaken using Kaplan-Meier estimates on the week 8 and week 18 VAS scores. Missing data will be handled by a single imputation method whereby the last observation will be carried forward and used as a surrogate for the missing value. This method is the favoured approach for replacing missing data because it is conservative, yields an appropriate estimate of variation in outcome and is unlikely to bias towards the alternative hypothesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. An alternative approach to missing data may be use of a longitudinal mixed-effects model incorporated into the analyses.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Sample size</title><p id="Par64">We hypothesise that over an 8-week treatment period, GBP will reduce pain on the VAS scale by an average of 4.5 points from (7.5 to 3.0) as per historical literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. We predict PGB to show at least the same benefit. We hypothesise that PGB will display superiority over GBP by at least a 20% better relative reduction in VAS score, with a resultant reduction of 5.4 (from 7.5 to 2.1) points from baseline. This 20% relative reduction is based on the average reduction of pain symptoms compared with placebo for indirect comparisons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Relative reduction will be used because it is often more impressive and also to allow for the instance of a lower-than-expected event rate, which would lower the absolute risk reduction.</p><p id="Par65">If the true difference in means of both arms of the study is 0.9 with an SD of 1.2, in order to detect this 20% relative decrease in pain between GBP and PGB, we will need to study 30 patients (15 per treatment arm) to reject the null hypothesis with 80% power. The type I error probability associated with this test of the null is 0.05. Assuming a 20% drop-out rate, the total sample size will be 38 patients (19 per treatment arm). We have chosen this large effect size and conservative SD on the basis of anecdotal and specialists&#x02019; experience with this cohort of patients. The benefits of the cross-over methodology are evident with the small sample size required, owing to each participant acting as his/her own control. If this were a conventional parallel study design, the sample size needed would be approximately 100 participants. We conservatively estimate that if two people can be recruited per week, the study duration will be approximately 1.5&#x000a0;years.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Adverse experiences and monitoring</title><p id="Par66">Potential risks of both PGB and GBP have been well studied owing to their use for neuropathic conditions. These risks have been minimised by our exclusion criteria. Any SEs will be monitored weekly during follow-up phone calls and examinations. Close monitoring of other neurological pain medications will be done with patient diaries. SEs were quantified in a latest meta-analysis and given the rare SEs of both medications and their likely effectiveness, and the potential benefits outweigh the risks in this study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p id="Par67">During the recruitment period, a monitoring visit may be applicable. The responsible monitor will be a specialist neurosurgeon who is not involved in the conduct of the trial and is chair of the hospital patient safety committee.

The trial may be stopped if more harm to patients is shown. The Pocock boundary will be used as the stopping rule, whereby after each set of 2n patient responses to a total of &#x02018;K&#x02019; looks at the data.&#x000a0;"2n" patient responses means there will be at least 2 interim analyses whereby the stopping rule can be enforced. This will be a group sequential approach whereby the critical boundary (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.018) will be set at each look.</p><p id="Par74">An adverse event is the appearance or worsening of any undesirable sign, symptom or medical condition occurring after starting the study, even if the event is not considered to be related to the investigational drug. Any SAE (defined as an event that is life-threatening or results in death, hospitalisation or significant disability) will be reported immediately to the relevant authorities (study monitor, ethics committee, data and safety monitoring board). If a potential relationship is suspected between the study drug and an SAE, then un-blinding to treatment allocation is indicated, and the participant will be withdrawn from PAGPROS.</p><p id="Par75">Abnormal laboratory values or test results constitute adverse events only if they induce clinical signs or symptoms, are considered clinically significant or require therapy. The occurrence of adverse events should be sought by non-directive questioning of the patient at each visit during the study.

Such amendment will be agreed upon by the study investigators and approved by the local ethics committee prior to implementation. Once approved, the changes will be communicated to the relevant parties.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec14" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p id="Par88">The PAGPROS protocol presents the design and rationale for a double-blind, double-dummy, randomised cross-over trial comparing the efficacy of PGB with GBP in treating CS. Owing to the variability in regular dosage frequency between the medications (PGB twice daily, GBP thrice daily), study medication packs will contain three bottles each, correlating to the dosage times of morning, lunchtime and night, to maintain blinding. Medication packs pertaining to the PGB arm will have placebo incorporated as the lunchtime dose, with all medications being indistinguishable.</p><p id="Par89">Thus, PAGPROS represents the first head-to-head study to determine the relative role of either PGB or GBP in the evidence-based medical management of CS. However, in addition to efficacy, PAGPROS will also determine the frequency and severity of SEs with PGB or GBP. Thus, PAGPROS will determine the &#x02018;efficacy versus SE trade-off&#x02019; with each drug and whether differences in compliance rates result in consequences. For example, in a prior study with GBP in treating CS, 31% of patients ceased GBP within 1&#x000a0;week of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Moreover, efficacy was significantly less in those who experienced SEs in that study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par90">In PAGPROS, we will employ the HLOC to assess psychological functioning with PGB or GBP in CS. In particular, PAGPROS will explore the prognosis of each drug relating to questionnaire outcomes relating to patients&#x02019; insight into their psychological dysfunction. Thus, PAGPROS may determine deficits and provide information not actually reported as SEs by the patients themselves. This may prove to be an important aspect of the study. For example, a prior prospective cohort study with GBP in treating CS revealed that, of 23 different SE types amongst 53% of patients, more than half could have adversely affected the ability to drive a motor vehicle safely or even to maintain employment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p><p id="Par91">Finally, the double-blind cross-over design of PAGPROS may provide guidance regarding the implications of any potential need to substitute one drug for the other. For example, PAGPROS may determine whether SEs experienced with one drug are also observed with the other (i.e., in the same patient, in close temporal succession after cross-over). This may prove especially important should PAGPROS demonstrate a between-groups null effect regarding efficacy. However, PAGPROS may show significant efficacy to one drug but no efficacy to the other. Despite a lack of an evidence base, many formulary regulatory authorities worldwide typically favour one drug for subsidy over the other [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. This hinders interchange wherever the favoured drug is either ineffective or not tolerated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. The nature of PAGPROS&#x02019;s design will directly assess the utility of cross-over between PGB and GBP and will therefore enable formulary regulatory authorities to make more informed therapeutic decisions than currently.</p><p id="Par92">Recruitment commenced in early 2016, with data collection to be completed by mid 2018. The allocation concealment and double-blind design minimise bias, and data collection processes ensure data quality and integrity. The trial team has extensive experience in the design, conduct and reporting of clinical trials. Results of the study will be disseminated via publications and presentations.</p><sec id="Sec15"><title>Potential weaknesses of PAGPROS</title><sec id="Sec16"><title>Treatment duration</title><p id="Par93">PAGPROS permits a 4-week titration period, after which the maximum tolerated dose for each participant will then be maintained for 4&#x000a0;weeks. The duration of individual drug study is therefore 8&#x000a0;weeks. In some rare cases, this might be considered insufficient to test efficacy at the optimum dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Furthermore, because anecdotally some patients develop tolerance to SEs incurred with either PGB or GBP, the study period may also be too short to detect SE tolerance.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17"><title>Dosages</title><p id="Par94">Given the restricted doses and study time available in PAGPROS, it is not possible to introduce either drug in &#x02018;low and slow&#x02019; fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. Because the latter potentially off-sets the development of SEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], PAGPROS may therefore potentially over-estimate SEs with either drug. However, at least with GBP, there exists some control in that a prospective cohort study found SEs in 53% of patients with CS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec18"><title>Maintenance of background therapies including prior analgesia</title><p id="Par95">This may affect both efficacy and SE development, potentially increasing both. However, note that this practice is entirely consistent with NICE-UK guidelines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], and, indeed, standard clinical practice.
