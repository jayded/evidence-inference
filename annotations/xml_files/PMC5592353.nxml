Estimates of morbidity and mortality have been published previously and indicate that premature death, mortality rates and the prevalence of risk factors in Latvia are alarmingly high [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1&#x02013;4</xref>]. The percentage of overweight and obese 15- to 64-year-old individuals in Latvia has increased from 49% in 2012 to 55% in 2014 [<xref rid="C4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. The probability of dying from one of the four main NCDs in Latvia between the ages of 30 and 70 in 2000 and 2012 (25.3% and 24.1%, respectively) still exceeds the global average of 23% and 19% respectively and is the highest rate in the EU [<xref rid="C1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. The age-standardised mortality rate from CVDs per 100,000 population in Latvia is still the highest compared, for example, with Estonia, Lithuania, Sweden and Finland, despite a slight decrease since 2000 [<xref rid="C2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. These numbers are alarming and will have inevitable impact on society, families and individuals unless drastic measures are taken. Prevention of NCDs is therefore a critical public health priority.</p><p>Overweight and obesity are associated with an increased risk of both all-cause mortality and CVDs even without comorbid conditions [<xref rid="C5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;8</xref>]. Recent evidence shows that the natural course of &#x02018;healthy obesity&#x02019; is a progression to metabolic deterioration [<xref rid="C9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="C10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>], and both WC and weight management are crucial to sustain a metabolically healthy status and reduce health care costs [<xref rid="C11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="C12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Even a partial weight normalisation may provide sufficient cardiovascular protection and improve insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. With some disagreements regarding specific CVD related outcomes, evidence of the last years has demonstrated the potential and benefit of &#x02018;realistic&#x02019; lifestyle intervention strategies in health promotion [<xref rid="C15" ref-type="bibr">15&#x02013;20</xref>].</p><p>The proactive and empowering functionality of short message service (SMS) may be a useful tool for encouraging behaviour change: it is widely available on mobile phones, inexpensive, it can be scheduled beforehand, it reaches the target instantly, a person can choose when to open it, and the text can be delivered even if the phone is turned off for a while. There is evidence that SMS-delivered interventions have positive short-term behavioural outcomes regarding weight loss and control, diet recommendations, diabetes self-control and haemoglobin A1C levels [<xref rid="C21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;24</xref>], and particularly, smoking cessation [<xref rid="C25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="C26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. SMS based prevention strategy can generate alerts for both subjects and their family members and facilitate the implementation of lifestyle prevention strategies and empowers subjects to prevent NCDs. Although a plethora of research exists on SMS, relatively less research has been conducted to address the role of SMS-based prevention among healthy obese individuals. The purpose of this study is to examine whether SMS text messaging facilitates a reduction of weight and waist circumference (WC) and favourable changes in some biochemical parameters in clinically healthy overweight and obese subjects. We conducted a randomised controlled trial that compared a SMS intervention and a control group in a primary health care setting in Riga, Latvia. It is anticipated that the implications of this strategy might facilitate the design of preventive and promotive strategies among high risk groups in Latvia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s0002"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s0003"><title>Recruitment of participants and randomisation</title><p>We selected patients from six randomly chosen family physicians&#x02019; practices of a health care centre in Riga. Clinically healthy individuals with a body mass index (BMI) above 25&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup>/kg in the age group of 30&#x02013;45 were invited during their visits to their primary care physicians (either as patients or accompanying a child) in 2012 or called after revising a list of patients in the appropriate age group. Potential participants were interviewed on the spot or by phone prior to the final invitation, and 150 participants were selected for the first appointment. Before being selected, all individuals underwent clinical and co-morbidity evaluation, anthropometric tests (weight, height, WC and hip circumference), as well as blood tests to exclude acute inflammatory processes, viral hepatitis, thyroid and kidney dysfunction. Patients with a history of arterial hypertension, non-infectious inflammatory diseases and malignancies within the last five years and/or those taking any regular medications were also excluded.</p><p>A total of 129 subjects were found eligible after the baseline appointment and analysis. Intervention group subjects were randomly selected by a free online random number generator (stattrek.com). Only the eligible participants who agreed to receive SMS messages were randomised. All the selected participants agreed to receive text messages.</p><p>Patients were seen for repeated anthropometric and blood tests and questionnaire after one year. Out of the 129 recruited subjects, 123 (63 in the intervention group and 60 in the control group) completed the study after one year. The process of selecting patients is outlined as a flow diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F0001">Figure 1</xref>.</p><fig id="F0001" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><p>Participant flow and follow-up.</p></caption><graphic content-type="black-white" xlink:href="ipri-35-262.F01"/></fig></sec><sec id="s0004"><title>Intervention</title><p>All 129 recruited individuals underwent testing related to cardiovascular risk factors: WC, BMI, fasting glucose and insulin test to check for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting lipidogram to check for dyslipidaemia, as well as abdominal CT scan for signs of fatty liver. During the first visit, all patients received advice on behavioural lifestyle changes (increase in physical activity and dietary recommendations regarding dyslipidaemia and weight loss, including the use of low-fat diet, fibres, slow carbohydrates, vegetables and reducing the consumption of full-milk products, animal fat, fast sugar, alcohol and soft drinks). After receiving laboratory and CT reports, all participants were consulted on their individual results and advised to reduce body weight or WC by 10% and to make the most appropriate dietary and physical activity changes according to their baseline self-reports and laboratory results. The 10% target was chosen due to the following reasons: (1) common recommendations that a 5&#x02013;10% weight loss may improve the cardiovascular risk factor and that greater weight losses generally produce greater improvements and may be necessary to normalise risk factors [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]; (2) it is more feasible for most people to make small compared to large short-term changes in diet and activity [<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]; (3) 10% of the baseline weight as a target is easy to calculate and remember.</p><p>Subjects of the intervention group received SMS messages once in two weeks over the course of a year. Text messages were included in a pre-set list and sent out automatically in the same order via the website of a Latvian mobile service provider, which allowed checking for undelivered messages. We used the business client feature to create automatic SMS lists in the website. If a message was not delivered for the second time, the researcher called the person to determine the reason. To assess the additional effect of SMS communication, but not the information included in the message per se, we provided all participants with a list of tips to be included in the messages. Those contained advice on losing weight with the ideas of planned behavioural theory and social cognitive theory. Messages could be divided into two big groups: (1) informative or cognitive (e.g. &#x02018;vegetables do not contain cholesterol&#x02019;; &#x02018;a glass of tomato juice contains 40&#x02009;kcal, orange juice &#x02013; 120&#x02009;kcal&#x02019;); (2) encouraging or behavioural (&#x02018;use seasonal vegetables when they smell and taste the best&#x02019; or &#x02018;always use stairs instead of an elevator&#x02019;).</p></sec><sec id="s0005"><title>Ethical consideration</title><p>The study was conducted as part of a doctoral thesis, approved by the Ethics Committee of Riga Stradins University.</p></sec><sec id="s0006"><title>Sample size calculation</title><p>To detect a 10% reduction in weight [<xref rid="C18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="C19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with a two-sided 5% significance level and a power of 80%, a sample size of 72 subjects per group was necessary, given a pooled standard deviation of 15 and an anticipated dropout rate of 50%.

Body height without shoes was measured to the nearest increment of 0.5&#x02009;cm by a calibrated stationary stadiometer. BMI was calculated as weight/height<sup>2</sup> (kg/m<sup>2</sup>). Blood samples were drawn in the fasting state for at least 12&#x02009;hours. If the report suggested that a person had not been fasting for 12&#x02009;hours, they were invited to return later.

However, our results suggest that SMS intervention did not facilitate changes in the lipid profile or fasting glucose levels.</p></sec><sec id="s0015"><title>Strengths and weaknesses</title><p>The strength of our study is that it is unique in Latvia, a country falling into a very high CVD risk category. It was a randomised controlled study designed and performed in primary care settings. Contrary to our expectations, the drop-out rate was less than 10%. This could be related to the fact that patients were selected from one health centre and they had an already established patient&#x02013;physician relationship. In light of this, the results should be cautiously applied to the general population; however, the possibility of applying the results to everyday clinical practice of a primary care physician is high. Choosing SMS intervention probably ensures a higher compliance rate, compared to on-site consultations, and allows for a wider spectrum of subjects to be covered. The duration of the study (12 months) minimises seasonal changes of parameters and is longer than most other studies [<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We could only find some studies with a sample size above 100 and a duration at least one year [<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>,<xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>The weakness of the study is that the sample size was calculated to an expected weight loss of 10% that most participants failed to reach. To avoid effect of seasonal weight variances, we did not provide interim check-up visits at three to six months, which would have made it easier to compare the results with those of other short-term studies.</p></sec><sec id="s0016"><title>Comparison of the results to other studies</title><p>In general, our study results are consistent with the studies showing that SMS intervention could be used as a tool for promoting health and reaching people out of office in a convenient and affordable manner [<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. According to our results, 90% of the intervention group subjects reported that SMS messages did not disturb or irritate them. Ninety five percent pointed out that they would like to receive further SMS communication regarding weight loss and the usefulness of the intervention was rated at seven out of 10 on average. The same positive attitude has been found in other studies of similar duration [<xref rid="C24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p><p>Different types of at least one-year-long interventions using diet and physical activity recommendations are associated with a weight loss of 5&#x02013;9%, which we did not reach. However, we exceeded the weight loss with advice alone (below 1%) [<xref rid="C31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. Our results indicated that the&#x02009;mean weight decreased slightly in the intervention group, compared to weight increase the control group.&#x02009;The&#x02009;findings&#x02009;imply that SMS intervention is even more useful in preventing metabolic deterioration of clinically healthy overweight and obese subjects in primary health care settings rather that facilitating weight loss. Another study using SMS messages showed that, in 12 months&#x02019; time, the intervention group had lost significantly more weight than the control group &#x02013; 4.5(&#x000b1;5.0) vs. 1.1(&#x000b1;5.8) &#x02013; which is slightly more than in our study [<xref rid="C29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. However, this study enrolled participants via advertisements and the participants were probably more motivated. A study including only women for three months, but choosing to send messages twice a day and requiring replies and self-reporting, showed a slightly higher weight loss in both the intervention group (2.94% vs. 2.4%) and control group (0.95% vs. weight gain 1.6%). However, the long-term effect and seasonal weight loss probability cannot be estimated [<xref rid="C32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In our study, multivariable analysis revealed that SMS text messaging has an independent effect in weight reduction controlling for age and sex.</p><p>Weight loss is associated with improved insulin sensitivity in proportion to the weight reduction [<xref rid="C13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. In moderately obese individuals with a more pronounced WC, it may achieve a particular benefit from losing any amount of excess weight in terms of insulin sensitivity [<xref rid="C14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. We did not find any significant decrease in insulin resistance measured by HOMA-IR, in spite of a decrease in weight and WC in the intervention group. However, our results show that intervention could prevent an increase in insulin levels in the intervention group, compared to the control group.</p><p>Similar to ours, a randomised study with 104 pre-diabetic drivers showed a slight decrease of weight and BMI in the SMS intervention group, with no mean change in WC, fasting glucose and lipids between groups, over time or in interaction effect between groups and time [<xref rid="C30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. This is also similar to the findings of several diet recommendation trials when lipid outcomes did not differ after intervention in spite of a slight weight loss [<xref rid="C33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Most probably, the achieved relative weight loss is not sufficient to result in substantial lipid changes in premorbid subjects unlike insulin resistance.</p><p>Motivational consulting as a method has shown better outcomes than brief advice, especially among those not &#x02018;ready to change&#x02019;; however, it is more expensive (e.g. consultation time, travel costs), covers only those who attend it and should be individually tailored [<xref rid="C20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="C34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Some studies still doubt its efficacy in routine practice [<xref rid="C28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p><p>We found that SMS communication is easy to use. Costs did not exceed standard rates per text message &#x02018;using group text messaging&#x02019;. Automatic or individualised text messaging option would be of greater help to fulfil the task.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s0017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>SMS messaging in clinically healthy overweight and obese subjects facilitates a slight decrease in weight, BMI and WC.
