In the early stages of the disease, autoreactive lymphocytes gain access to the central nervous system, initiating a cascade of events leading to demyelination, axonal transection, and neurodegeneration.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="bibr2-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> In later stages, infiltrative inflammation plays a less prominent role, but extensive neuronal loss and gliosis are evident.<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Hence, initiation of MS treatment early in the disease course, when the potential for slowing the accumulation of damage is greatest, could be a clinically meaningful approach. Consistent with this, previous studies with interferon beta and glatiramer acetate (GA) demonstrated an association between early treatment and improved outcomes, such as a prolonged time to conversion from clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) to clinically definite MS (CDMS) and a reduction in the number and volume of lesions on MRI.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="bibr4-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr5-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr6-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr7-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr"/><xref rid="bibr8-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr"/>&#x02013;<xref rid="bibr9-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup></p><p>Delayed-release dimethyl fumarate (DMF) is a novel, oral MS therapeutic studied in people with relapsing&#x02013;remitting MS (RRMS).

The odds of having more Gd+ lesions were analyzed using ordinal logistic regression adjusted for study, region, and baseline number of Gd+ lesions.

One year was the median time since diagnosis for the treatment-na&#x000ef;ve population of DEFINE and CONFIRM, and it fell clearly within the range of criteria used to characterize the newly diagnosed population in the literature. It should be noted, however, that the patient subgroup evaluated in this report represents patients with early RRMS and not patients with CIS at disease onset.</p><p>The recommended dosing regimen of delayed-release DMF is 240 mg BID. The data for 240 mg TID were included here to explore the general consistency of the effects between the doses. In the newly diagnosed population, similar to the ITT population, the effect sizes with delayed-release DMF BID and TID were broadly similar. However, both BID and TID showed a treatment effect on reducing disability progression in the same direction. Although the effect size was different between BID and TID (71% vs. 47% reduction), the confidence intervals of the point estimates overlapped. Therefore, the different effect size was mainly due to data variations of the newly diagnosed population.</p><p>The safety and tolerability profile of delayed-release DMF in newly diagnosed patients presented here, while limited in scope, is acceptable and comparable to that seen in the overall integrated safety population of DEFINE and CONFIRM. For example, the overall incidence of adverse events in the newly diagnosed subgroup was 92%, 97%, and 95% in the placebo, delayed-release DMF BID, and delayed-release DMF TID groups, respectively, compared with 93%, 95%, and 94% in the overall safety population.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> Flushing, nasopharyngitis, and gastrointestinal events including diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain were among the most common adverse events reported by patients treated with delayed-release DMF in both populations.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> The incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of study treatment in the newly diagnosed subgroup was 5%, 12%, and 11% in the placebo, delayed-release DMF BID, and delayed-release DMF TID groups, respectively, compared with 12%, 14%, and 14% in the overall safety population.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1352458514537013" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p><p>Finally, it should be borne in mind that this is a post-hoc analysis, and, as such, the results should be interpreted cautiously.
