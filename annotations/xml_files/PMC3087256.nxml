We studied two different doses of neostigmine.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Patients &#x00026; Methods:</title><p>A randomized double blind study was conducted on ninety adult females scheduled for lower intra abdominal surgeries. The study was designed to compare two doses of epidural neostigmine co administered with lignocaine, with regard to its analgesic efficacy and its effect on sedation in postoperative period. Patients were divided into three groups of 30 each. Group I received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with normal saline (1ml), group II lignocaine1% (9ml) with neostigmine 100&#x003bc;g in saline (1ml) and group III received lignocaine 1% (9ml) with neostigmine 200&#x003bc;g in NS (1ml). Group I served as a control. In operating room, after putting epidural catheter, general anesthesia was administered with propofol (2mg kg<sup>-1</sup>), succinylcholine (2mg kg<sup>-1</sup>) and maintained with O2, N2O, relaxant technique. At the end of surgery, patients were reversed. Epidural analgesic medication was administered to after proper recovery from anesthesia. Intensity of pain relief on VAS, duration of analgesia, level of sensory block, motor blockade, sedation by sedation score and complications were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Results:</title><p>The addition of neostigmine resulted in significant longer duration of analgesia (dose independent) and sedation (dose dependent). Sensory and motor blockade were identical in all three groups. There was no incidence of respiratory depression, pruritus, bradycardia or hypotension in any group.

Informed written consent was taken from patient or patient's kins. Patients with contraindication to epidural anesthesia, allergy to local anesthetics and pregnant females were excluded from this study. Patients were divided into following groups of 30 each, according to the epidural medication, they received: </p><p>Group I: lignocaine 1% 9ml+normal saline (NS) 1 ml. </p><p>Group II: lignocaine 1% 9ml+neostigmine 100&#x003bc;g in NS 1ml </p><p>Group III: lignocaine 1% 9ml+neostigmine 200&#x003bc;g in NS 1ml </p><p>In operating room after intravenous access and application of monitors, epidural catheterization was performed under strict aseptic conditions, at L2-L3 or L3-L4 interspace in sitting position. A Test dose in the form of 3mL injection of lignocaine (2%) and epinephrine (1:200,000) was given through epidural catheter to confirm proper placement of epidural catheter.</p><p>Thereafter, the patients were premedicated with intravenously glycopyrrolate (0.005 mg kg <sup>-1</sup> ), ondansetrone (8 mg) and fentanyl (1 &#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> ), 5 min prior to induction of anesthesia. All patients were induced with propofol (2mg kg <sup>-1</sup> ) and succinylcholine (2mg kg <sup>-1</sup> ), followed by endotracheal intubation. Anesthesia was maintained with O2, N2O, vecuronium, intermittently. The residual neuromuscular blockade was reversed at the end of surgery using neostigmine and glycopyrrolate (2:1). Epidural neostigmine solution was prepared, by a person who did not participate in this study any further, by mixing neostigmine and lignocaine to obtain two concentrations of neostigmine in lignocaine 1% (100 &#x003bc;g for Group II and 200 &#x003bc;g for Group III patients). In order to maintain uniformity, the volume of epidural medication was kept constant at 10ml, for all the three groups. The solution was injected through epidural catheter at the end of surgery, after recovery from anesthesia.</p><p>Before giving drug through epidural catheter, blood pressure, heart rate, VAS, sensory level and level of motor blockade was assessed. After 15 minutes of first epidural dose VAS, sensory level and level of motor blockade was reassessed. Intramuscular diclofenac, 75 mg, was used for rescue analgesia.</p><p>In post anesthetic recovery room, patients were assessed for:</p><p>

Vitals of all the patients were recorded every 15 minutes for first 2 hrs postoperatively and hourly for next 22 hours.</p><p>Patients were monitored for side effects like respiratory depression, hypotension, nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Since patients were catheterized preoperatively, urinary retention, as a side effect, was not taken into consideration. Stastical tests used were student &#x02032;t&#x02032;test and ANOVA test.</p><p>Sample size estimation was performed with the help of PS and Sample Size calculator developed by Vanderbilt University's Clinical and Translational Science Award (CTSA) program (grant UL1 RR024975 from the NCRR/NIH). We planned a study of a continuous response variable (VAS for pain) from three experimental groups with equal proportion of patients in each. In a previous study the response within each subject group was normally distributed with standard deviation 1. If the true difference in the two experimental groups&#x02032; means is 1, we will need to study 17 subjects in each group to be able to reject the null hypothesis that the population means of the experimental and control groups are equal with probability (power) 0.8. The Type I error probability associated with this test of this null hypothesis is 0.05. However, in order to enhance the power and reliability of study we have selected 30 patients in each group which is statistically not a small sample.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-2"><title>RESULTS</title><p>The patient characteristics age, height and weight were comparable.

It eases patient's discomfort and results in early mobilization. Many additives like clonidine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">1</xref>, opioids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref> and epinephrine<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref> have been investigated in epidural space and the results showed improvement in duration, intensity of analgesia and reduction in local anesthetic dose. The current study determined the analgesic effectiveness of two different doses of epidural neostigmine with lignocaine, along with its effect on sedation. The results showed encouraging clinical performance.</p><p>The current study established that addition of epidural neostigmine 100&#x003bc;g or 200&#x003bc;g to lignocaine 1% increased the duration of analgesia as compared to control group. The effect seems to be dose independent because comparison of duration between group II and group III was stastically insignificant. Nakayama et al. (2001) also concluded that duration of analgesia was significantly increased with epidural neostigmine 5&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> or 10&#x003bc;g kg<sup>-1</sup> with bupivacaine and effects were dose independent.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref></p><p>The improvement in duration of analgesia was also explained by Lauretti et al. (1999) who stated that neostigmine causes analgesia by increasing endogenous acetylcholine levels to act on muscarinic M1 receptors.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref></p><p>Pain intensity assessed by VAS was similar in all three groups at the end of surgery, but after 15 minutes it was significantly less in group II and III when compared to group I. The results show that addition of epidural neostigmine is associated with better pain relief, though in a dose independent manner. The similar results have been reported by other workers.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">9</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></p><p>In current study, we found that level of sensory block was not affected by addition of neostigmine. The height of sensory block did not increase with higher dose of neostigmine. This could be due to volume of drug, which was kept constant in our study.</p><p>The current study also inferred that different doses of epidural neostigmine do not affect the motor blockade. Maxi-mum score was obtained at 30 mins after the epidural loading dose which decreased gradually with passage of time.</p><p>Higher doses of intrathecal neostigmine can cause sedation<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">16</xref>. Post operative sedation was increased by epidural neostigmine but in a dose independent manner<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref>. Conversely in our study, the addition of epidural neostigmine produced mild sedation in both the neostigmine groups but sedation was statistically significant with high dose of neostigmine (Group III). The effects were found to be dose dependent in our study. It may be due to difference in type of anesthesia (general anesthesia in our study vs. combined spinal epidural technique), difference in doses of neostigmine (200 &#x003bc;g vs. 300&#x003bc;g) and addition of intrathecal fentanyl in study by Nurkaya et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">12</xref></p><p>In present study the mean arterial pressure and heart rate were assessed in three groups at every 15 minutes for first 2hrs and then hourly during next 24 hrs. None of the patients had fall in blood pressure more than 15% of baseline, which was statistically insignificant on comparison between three groups. Fall in heart rate from baseline was highest in group III which was stastically significant. Bradycardia below 50 bpm was not noticed in any patient, so atropine administration was not required. The change in heart rate was more in group III during 1<sup>st</sup> hour. This may be explained by cholinergic side effects at higher doses of neostigmine, secondary to systemic absorption.</p><p>We did not encounter the bothering problems of pruritus or respiratory depression usually occurring with epidural opioids<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17">17</xref>. The incidence of nausea and vomiting was observed both in control as well as neostigmine group (200&#x003bc;g). This was stastically in significant and may be attributed to type of surgery (laparotomy). It may be inferred that nausea &#x00026; vomiting seen after intrathecal administration<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">13</xref>is not so prominent after epidural neostigmine.</p><p>It may be concluded that neostigmine, as an adjuvant to epidural lignocaine (1%), prolongs the duration of analgesia (dose independent) and causes mild sedation (dose dependent),with almost negligible associated side effects. Further, the investigated doses of epidural neostigmine are safe and useful for clinical use.</p><p><bold>Authors disclosure</bold>: Authors have no conflict of interest or financial
