annually and have been observed as a huge global health challenge.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Over two-thirds of these deaths are preventable and take place in countries and in settings where resources are scarce.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1 2</xref> These deaths are the reflection of huge societal inequities and inaccessibility to quality care at and around the time of birth.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> With the transition from Millennium Development Goals to the new global Sustainable Development Goals, absolute targets have been set to reduce stillbirth and neonatal mortality.<xref rid="R4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> In the last 25 years, investment has been made to identify cost-effective interventions such as intrapartum fetal heart rate surveillance, neonatal resuscitation, early initiation of breastfeeding, Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC), infection prevention and management to reduce mortality during the intrapartum and neonatal period.<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5&#x02013;7</xref> However, translation of these evidence-based interventions into effective clinical practice and at scale has been a challenge in low resource settings where the economic benefit is high.<xref rid="R3" ref-type="bibr">3 8 9</xref> In an effort to provide guidance for implementation of perinatal interventions to countries, WHO has recommended <italic>Standards for improving quality of maternal and newborn care in health facilities</italic>.<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> However, these proposed standards for care require rigorous evaluation in health system context in terms of its ability to translate science into practice.</p><p>The research group has previously conducted a study on a quality improvement (QI) model for standard neonatal resuscitation (Helping Babies Breathe-quality improvement cycle (HBB-QIC)) in a tertiary hospital setting in Nepal and reported improvements in health worker&#x02019;s performance and perinatal outcome.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11 12</xref> However, the upscale of this model in the health system setting has yet to be evaluated in terms of its effectiveness and sustainability.</p><p>There were two major lesson learnt from this previous study evaluating HBB-QIC. First, effort on neonatal resuscitation reduced intrapartum stillbirth and first-day mortality. However, it did not reduce overall perinatal mortality,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> so a comprehensive neonatal care intervention is needed to see overall change in perinatal mortality. Therefore, the Nepal Perinatal&#x000a0;Quality Improvement Project (NePeriQIP) focuses on the continuum of care during the perinatal period, adding training on all aspects of the National Neonatal Clinical Protocol to the HBB training.</p><p>Second, a sustainable approach for QI implementation is necessary especially in settings where the resources for support are scare and inconsistent. Systematic reviews have also shown that a combination of implementation strategies, such as weekly review meetings, and periodic simulated skill checks, checklists and self-evaluation is a more effective strategy to improve the clinical performance than a single strategy.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14&#x02013;18</xref> This was also the experience from the previous HBB-QIC trial, where multiple implementation strategies were used. Process audit and feedback complemented training, which resulted in retention of skills learnt during training and new practices implemented in the clinic.<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>
</p><p>Nepal has pledged to reduce the current stillbirth rate of 18 per 1000 births to 13 and newborn mortality to 11 per 1000 live births by 2035, committing to the Every Newborn Action Plan.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20 21</xref> Improving quality of care around the time of birth will save lives and reduce morbidity but require a functional health system. Similar to other low-income countries, delivering quality health services to the population remains a challenge in Nepal, despite increase in number of human resources and improved infrastructure.<xref rid="R22" ref-type="bibr">22 23</xref> With the nationwide introduction of demand side financing for improving access to maternal and neonatal care in the health facilities since 2005, the number of women delivering in institutions has increased by threefold.<xref rid="R23" ref-type="bibr">23&#x02013;25</xref>
</p><p>An assessment of quality of perinatal care in hospitals of Nepal has shown that health workers do not perform as per the standards and lack necessary tools and environment to implement those standards.<xref rid="R26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> The context of rapid increase in institutional deliveries and poor quality of care warrants improvement in the structures, systems and performance for perinatal care.</p><p>In response to these needs and with the lessons learnt from previous trials, NePeriQIP intends to scale&#x000a0;up an extended version of the HBB-QIC package for improved perinatal care in hospitals in Nepal. Primary objective of this study is to evaluate impact of this scaled-up intervention on intrapartum mortality (intrapartum stillbirth and first-day mortality). Secondary objectives are to assess the effect of the intervention model on overall neonatal mortality and morbidity and health worker&#x02019;s performance on neonatal care, and to evaluate the process of implementation. A cost-effectiveness analysis to further guide health system investments will also be performed.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Setting</title><p>The NePeriQIP intervention will be implemented in 12 district level public hospitals in Nepal.

These mentors will be clinicians with experience of working in perinatal health. They will be responsible to revitalise and orient the administration at each hospital to implement the NePeriQIP intervention. Using set selection criteria 2&#x02013;4, QI facilitators will be recruited internally at each hospital. These facilitators will be responsible to implement the QI interventions in clinical units in each of the 12 hospitals. The QI facilitators and mentors will be trained on facilitation skills and standard perinatal care package by the research team. As a first task the QI facilitators will together with clinical unit staffs conduct assessment of the readiness, availability and quality of perinatal care. Based on the findings, a causal/bottleneck analysis on inadequacy of quality of perinatal care will be conducted. Results will be shared with the hospital administration and a plan will be developed and implemented to improve the quality of perinatal care. Routine use of inpatient sick newborn register will be strengthened to improve the monitoring of perinatal care.

Randomisation was performed proportionate to number of deliveries per year in each hospital starting by allocating one of the four largest hospitals to each wedge and then continued with the middle-range hospitals. Finally, the four hospitals with the least deliveries per year were randomly allocated to each wedge. This implies that all hospitals will eventually receive the intervention with a total duration of 12 months (3 months preparatory phase and 9 months implementation phase). In order to achieve a sustained effect of the intervention, the hospital managements will be stimulated to continue beyond the intervention period of 12 months.</p><fig id="F1" orientation="portrait" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Gantt chart for intervention design.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="bmjgh-2017-000497f01"/></fig><p>At the hospitals with most expected deliveries in each wedge on-location observations of clinical practice during delivery and immediate postnatal care will be performed.</p><p>All three phases will be evaluated through process evaluation where documentation of activities and decisions, trainings, activities and the supportive supervision of mentors will be gathered.

Calculations performed with R package CRTsize.</p><p>Given the limitation of the cluster-randomised design to detect changes in small proportion we have also calculated the change in intrapartum mortality possible to detect at each hospital when comparing baseline (variable number of months) and intervention period (9 months) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2i"><title>Data management</title><p>For the purpose of ensuring high-quality data collection, management and data security an independent data monitoring committee will be formed. All data will be saved on a server and backed up on a weekly basis.

Descriptive analyses and logistic regression will be used to detect differences between study arms and time points. Cross-sectional data gathered through the established surveillance system and clinical observations will produce a large data set allowing for epidemiological analyses.

First, since some of these hospitals are geographically located in adjacent districts, there is a risk of contamination of intervention roll out as there are routine periodic meetings of the health workers of different hospitals. However, since the intervention is not only consisting of new knowledge being taught but also includes structural changes at the hospital after intervention the contamination will be limited. Second, the information on the stillbirths and neonatal death is from the record registers, there is a chance of reporting bias (differential misclassification) by the health workers. Third, since there will be a clinical observation by surveillance officer in each hospital throughout the study period, there is a risk of observer&#x02019;s bias in recording and registry practices, as well as a strengthening effect on clinical practice that might dilute results. Close monitoring of the data collection process will be implemented, with onsite supervision and continuous capacity-building of data collectors to curb the potential problems with reporting and observation biases.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>Different QI initiatives for perinatal health have been piloted and proposed in small-scale models in different countries, including Nepal. However, these QI interventions have not been rigorously evaluated in district health system contexts. We propose a scaled-up intervention to put structures, systems and processes in place for quality improvement for perinatal care in hospital settings that is scalable and sustainable. A close collaboration with the Ministry of Health and the existing structures within the health system are essential components to get the needed buy-in and to secure sustainability of the initiative. Multiple interactions with the Ministry of Health have been undertaken as part of developing the implementation guidelines, which if proven successful might be disseminated and scaled&#x000a0;up to all hospitals in the country. An implementation guideline development workshop was held in Kathmandu in March 2017 to get input from important stakeholders and to mainstream the initiative.</p><p>The Global Strategy for Women, Children and Adolescent&#x02019;s Health 2016&#x02013;2030 paves the road for the health-related sustainable development goals by focusing on disability-free survival.<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> However, evidence on the effects of neonatal interventions on morbidity and impairment is sparsely available from low-income and middle-income settings. Data on neonatal morbidity such as neonatal encephalopathy and impairment following intrapartum hypoxia are not available from the hospitals in low-income setting like Nepal. As a result, good estimates of country-specific burden of disease information is not available.</p><p>The global Every Newborn Action Plan launched by UN&#x02019;s secretary general in 2014 World Health Assembly highlights a need for global attention for perinatal health. The plan urged countries to make quality of care for mothers and newborn a priority as well as strengthen the data for better accountability.
