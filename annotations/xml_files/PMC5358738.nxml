have been global priorities for over two decades.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Considerable effort has focused on enhancing infrastructure, training of birth attendants, and improving emergency obstetric care in limited-resource settings.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] In Mexico, the 2013 MM ratio Global Burden of Disease estimate was 54 deaths per 100,000 live births [<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] with the majority of deaths due to obstetric emergencies, namely postpartum hemorrhage, preeclampsia and sepsis.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] Mexico, has focused on increasing the access to facility-based birth attended by skilled professionals.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Although, 99.6% of births in Mexico were attended by skilled providers in hospitals,[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] 80% of maternal deaths took place inside a medical facility and 87% of the women who died received facility-based attention before their death.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] For NM, increased efforts have resulted in a decreased rate of 7.2 per 1,000 live births, a figure that is still high compared to high-income countries.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]</p><p>Global efforts have refocused towards the provision of patient-centered and evidence-based quality care, thus acknowledging that a good share of morbidity and mortality are linked to the mis-management of normal physiologic births and not only to the response to emergencies.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] Renfrew and colleagues conducted a systematic review to categorize obstetric and neonatal practices by the level of evidence regarding benefit and/or harm.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] They devised a framework for quality maternal and newborn care using the best available evidence for effective practices: continuous labour support, Active Management of Third Stage of Labor (AMTSL), Delayed umbilical Cord Clamping (DCC), Skin-to-Skin mother-baby Contact (SSC), restricted episiotomy, alternative vs. conventional institutional settings for birth, and others.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] They identified several outcomes that could be improved by care within the scope of midwifery such as decreased number of unnecessary interventions and improved effective practices.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>Worldwide consensus establishes that three practices can improve outcomes and prevent significant childbirth complications, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) [<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and Mexican guidelines [<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]: AMTSL, DCC, and immediate maternal-newborn SSC.</p><p>There is considerable evidence that AMTSL, prevents obstetric hemorrhage, justifying its practice with every birth.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] DCC, has been shown to prevent anemia in the neonate for at least the first six months after birth.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] SSC is linked to immediate breastfeeding and has numerous long-term physiologic benefits for both mother and baby, besides a lowered risk of postpartum hemorrhage.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]</p><p>Despite global acceptance of these practices and their inclusion in national regulations, their routine implementation is rare in Mexico.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] On the contrary, there are other potentially harmful practices whose routine use is pervasive in the Mexican health system, namely, routine episiotomy, fundal pressure (Kristeller maneuver) and uterine sweeping.</p><p>An episiotomy is a surgical incision through the perineum, performed for expediting the birth of the baby and was thought to prevent higher-level perineal lacerations.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] The WHO, rejects the routine use of episiotomy and only recommends it for specific complications such as fetal distress, shoulder dystocia, or breech- presentation.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] There is no evidence that routine episiotomy decreases perineal damage, future vaginal prolapse or urinary incontinence.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] In fact, it is associated with an increase of third and fourth degree tears and subsequent anal sphincter muscle dysfunction, hematomas, infections, and pain.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Unfortunately, it continues to be a routine practice in Mexico, with some studies showing its use in 38% to 66% of all births.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]</p><p>The Kristeller maneuver involves the application of manual pressure on the fundus of the uterus in an effort to expedite a vaginal birth.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] It was historically used to avoid a prolonged second stage of labor or the need for cesarean section.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] The maneuver itself carries increased risk of uterine rupture and other maternal morbidity, and as such it is not recommended as the risks outweigh the benefits.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Although few studies have tried to estimate its prevalence, the available evidence suggests it continues to be used routinely in Mexican institutions, with alarming figures ranging between 17% and 40%.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]</p><p>In uterine sweeping, the provider inserts a gloved hand wrapped in gauze into the uterus after the birth of the placenta to remove any remaining placental parts.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] The vast majority of placentas are expelled intact, thus negating the need for this as a routine prophylactic measure.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] Additionally, this practice carries with it a number of risks including severe pain, infection, and uterine rupture.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] The Kristeller maneuver continues to be routinely used throughout Mexico, as more than 80% of the women who received care in the states of Oaxaca,[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and Guerrero,[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] received this intervention.</p><p>The current situation regarding these clinical practices points to some clear disconnects in the provision of care during physiologic births that may be important for the reduction of MM and NM.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] Global programs for in-service and interprofessional training of providers can help to meet the need for continued education and practice of care during childbirth.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] All too often official guidelines for practice and the latest evidence-based practice recommendation are not fully incorporated into clinical practice &#x02018;on the ground&#x02019;.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Knowledge gaps, skill deficiency, motivation, and system problems (supplies, infrastructure) all contribute to decreased quality of care.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] However, research has shown that simulation and team-training can improve provider response to patient outcomes in general.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]</p><p>Combined focus on the quality of care during physiologic birth and during obstetric and neonatal emergencies inside institutions through training and systems change

the importance of the technical quality of care of normal deliveries has only been recently recognized, to our knowledge there are no reports in Mexico about strategies devised to improve it.</p><p>This report presents the results of a secondary analysis of a cluster-randomized trial, with the objective of estimating the impact of PRONTO, a simulation-based training intervention, on the performance of evidence based routine practices during delivery.</p></sec><sec id="sec007"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="sec008"><title>Study design</title><p>A pair-matched cluster randomized controlled trial of the intervention was designed to measure the impact of the program (PRONTO intervention) on a sample of 24 hospitals (12 intervention and 12 control) in the states of Chiapas, Guerrero, and Mexico State.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Data was collected at 4 time points (baseline, 4<sup>th</sup>, 8<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup> months after the training). The units of analysis for this study were individual observed births (n = 641).</p><p>The analytic sample was comprised of 641 observed births in twenty-four hospitals selected for the study: 318 in the treatment arm and 323 in the control arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172623.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The first stage was to select hospitals that offer obstetric services of the Ministry of Health in Mexico (n = 570). As an inclusion criteria, the next step selected only level 2 hospitals, which had between 500 and 3000 annual deliveries (n = 265). This step was taken for logistic and financial considerations. Secretaries of Health of the states of Guerrero, Chiapas and Mexico were approached to secure permission to implement the training and the evaluation. There were initially 84 eligible hospitals of said states, of which 24 were selected for being in the high-mortality list. The sample size was determined to be sufficient to detect an impact on obstetric emergency indicators for the main objective of the study, as previously described (see Power calculation, below).[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] Prior to the start of baseline data collection, however, 11 of the 24 selected hospitals were replaced because they were unable to participate for a variety of reasons including restructuring, remodeling, or natural disaster damage; replacement was done by randomly selecting from among the remaining pool of 60 eligible hospitals not in the high-mortality list.

Module II (2 to 3 months after Module I) reinforces Module I themes and adds shoulder dystocia and preeclampsia/eclampsia. PRONTO trainings utilize the hybrid birth simulator PartoPants with a patient actress (often a hospital staff/training participant) to simulate birth and the Laerdal NeoNatalie for the neonatal resuscitation.<sup>27</sup> Simulation scenarios, when possible, occur in the actual clinical setting (emergency department, labor ward, delivery room, operating room, recovery room) where care is provided.

The goal was to observe at least 10 vaginal births by different providers on different shifts in each hospital over a maximum 5-day period at each visit. Prior to birth observation, both the health provider and the laboring woman provided oral consent. Observers were instructed to watch deliveries starting from the second stage of labor and ending 10&#x02013;20 minutes after the third stage was completed. The observers used a checklist to collect data and were not blinded to treatment allocation. Data collection began in August 2010 and follow-up concluded in March 2013.</p></sec><sec id="sec012"><title>Variable definitions</title><p>The main outcomes were the performance of the following routine practices: 1) AMTSL defined as: (a) applying 10 international units of oxytocin in the first minute after the birth of the baby, (b) traction and counter-traction of the umbilical cord, and (c) uterine massage immediately after the birth of the placenta. 2) Use of DCC, defined as a delay in the clamping of the umbilical cord of at least 60 seconds after the birth of the baby. 3) SSC defined as immediate contact between mother and child after birth. 4) Episiotomy defined as the performance of an incision in the female perineum including skin, muscular plane and vaginal mucosa. 5) Fundal uterine pressure, defined as application of manual pressure on the upper part of the uterus directed towards the birth canal. 6) Uterine sweeping, defined as the introduction of the hand or clamps into the uterus after the birth of the placenta.</p><p>The intervention variable was the hospital assignment to the training (yes/no).

For bivariate treatment group comparisons of the outcome variables at baseline, simple logistic regression models considering robust standard errors were fitted to the data. To estimate the impact of the PRONTO training on the probability of performing a given practice at 4, 8 and 12 month post intervention, we fitted difference-in-differences [<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] mixed effects logistic regression models. All models considered fixed-effects of the matched pairs to control for this aspect of the study design and inclusion of the attending provider&#x02019;s profession (intern, resident, general practitioner, obstetrician, nurse or other) as a covariate. After fitting the models, impact estimates were expressed in terms of the change in the probability of the outcome. All analyses were performed using STATA v. 13.0 (StataCorp. 2013. College Station, TX: StataCorp LP).</p></sec><sec id="sec014"><title>Ethics</title><p>We obtained verbal consent from all women whose deliveries were observed, as well as from the health care providers who attended those deliveries. Study staff was instructed to abandon the delivery room in case consent wasn&#x02019;t given or in case a clear answer was not obtained. Consent was verbal as it was deemed impractical and intrusive to ask for written concern in the midst of labor/delivery; this procedure along with all instruments for data collection and for pre- and post-training evaluations, letters of consents, as well as the study protocol were approved by the Ethics and Research Committees of the National Institute of Public Health in Mexico (Reference 845, August 2, 2010). The trial is also registered at clinicaltrials.gov: NCT01477554; registration was done after enrollment began as the research team was unsure at the time on whether trials such as this (with no direct intervention on patients) were eligible for registration.

Performance of birth practices at baseline also showed balance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pone.0172623.t002">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>We found significant effects on the outcome variables at four, eight, and twelve months after the intervention (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172623.g001">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172623.g005">5</xref>).

At eight months we estimated an 18 percentage point increase of fundal pressure (p-value = 0.034) and at four and eight months a 30 (p-value = 0.001) and 22 (p-value = 0.010) percentage point decrease of uterine sweeping, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0172623.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The apparent increase of fundal pressure and DCC are mainly driven by an unexplained decrease of the incidence of these practices in the control group at eight (3% [95% CI: 0, 6.9%] vs. 27% [95% CI: 17, 37%] at four months) and twelve months (61% [95% CI: 47, 75%] vs. 85% [95% CI: 72, 98%] at eight months) post intervention, respectively.

Only two evidence-based practices were found to be significantly affected by the training at twelve months post intervention: first step of AMTSL and DCC. Also we found an apparent increase of fundal pressure at eight months driven by an unexplained decrease of the incidence of this practice in the control group which might be due to problems in the assessment of this practice by the observers or by other training efforts we were unaware of, as well as any changes in the personnel at control hospitals who did not practice fundal pressure.</p><p>It is important to point out that the training primarily focused on emergency obstetric and neonatal care; the session on normal birth practices was a relatively short discussion (about 45&#x02013;60 minutes) during Module I, and the concepts were reviewed in three scenarios and their respectively simulations&#x02019; debriefs (of a total of six simulations and 16 hours of training). In light of this relatively minor focus, it is interesting to see that normal birth practices were significantly impacted. This suggests that a training specifically geared towards normal physiologic birth may have a larger, more lasting impact. The use of the simulator in which one of the trainees played the role of the patient may have also contributed to a behavioral change even in the most entrenched practices. In other words: having the nurse or doctor in the simulations reflect on the experience of being a &#x0201c;patient&#x0201d; may have helped to change their behavior. More research should be done to look into the power of this phenomenon.</p><p>PRONTO combines training in emergency response with normal birth care within the context of inter-professional team training and grounded in highly-realistic in-situ simulation. This type of learning is new in Mexico, where medical training emphasizes traditional authority-based medicine and entrenched clinical practices with lesser push to institute evidence-based care. This phenomenon may reflect a lack of current knowledge or access to recent research and/or a lack of incentives coupled with a disincentive (punishment) for the use of evidence-based practices that contradict leadership.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] Another limitation of medical training in Mexico is a lack of repetitive practice inside the hospitals. The training strategy used during the intervention may have filled these gaps in the treated hospitals.</p><p>Although we found significant changes for the main outcomes at different follow-up periods, we also found a dilution of the effect over time. There are several possible explanations that could account for this. First, we could not determine if we were training innovators and early adopters [<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] or those so entrenched in their beliefs, that no training would change their behavior. Furthermore, there is a high rate of staff turnover, especially within the nursing staff which rotates between services and new interns arriving every 6 and 12 months. Finally, there is evidence that effective training efforts require reinforcement mechanisms and top-off trainings because learning might last 6 months [<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] which, although PRONTO teams returned for a second module three months after the first, there was no follow-up after this.</p><p>Large fluctuations in the incidence of some practices such as fundal pressure and DCC at different time-points, particularly in the control group, may reflect a lack of clarity of these concepts by the observers. However, observers were not assigned to a particular hospital and they were indistinctly sent to either a control or treated unit at any given point in time. Additionally, even though observers were not blinded to the treatment assignment of the facility, they were unable to assess which of the observed providers had participated in the training and which had not, and more importantly, they were instructed not to discuss training participation with providers, which leads to greater confidence in the results. In fact, an additional set of models adjusting for observer yielded the same results (not shown).</p><p>Another important limitation is that we did not collect variables on the level of the individual mother whose birth was observed. Some of these non-observable variables such as the mothers&#x02019; education or socio-economic level may influence health professionals&#x02019; provision of care.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] However, since the intervention was randomized, we expect the distribution of these covariates to be balanced between intervention and control groups. Additionally any remaining time-invariant confounders that failed to be equally distributed between arms by means of the matching and the randomization, were likely controlled by the Difference-in-Differences approach, [<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] leaving little room for bias. A final important limitation is that this study was conducted in very particular settings within Mexico, which may yield these results not generalizable to other settings in the country or abroad.</p><p>A major strength of this study was the design and randomization of the larger intervention. The methodology used, including the analytical strategy, was devised to correctly estimate the impact of this program, even considering the implementation problems. We need to conduct additional analyses to estimate the actual impact on birth attendance practices specifically in trained personnel, isolating it from the effect on those not trained in the intervention hospitals (average treatment-on-the-treated effect or ATT). This is due to the fact that only an average of 21% of total eligible personnel was trained in the 12 interventions hospitals. The budget constraints and timeline of the project was a limitation for training a greater proportion of the personnel and thus the designers&#x02019; expectation was that trained participants would share their new knowledge to those who were not trained. Since we found a dilution of the effect, for future interventions we recommend to train a proportion of eligible personnel that is closer to a 100% and to have continuing education events or refreshers at least once a year to increase up-take and reinforce behavioral changes.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec017"><title>Conclusions</title><p>PRONTO has an impact on evidence-based routine practices at birth, contributing to an increased quality of care as categorized by recent frameworks.[<xref rid="pone.0172623.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] The potential to have a long lasting impact on the performance of evidence-based practices would be greater with widespread adoption of the training strategy including simulation, team-training and facilitated discussions regarding adequate care.
