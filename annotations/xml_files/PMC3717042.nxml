There is a considerable amount of evidence on the effectiveness of traditional face-to-face stress-management interventions for employees; however, they are often costly, time-consuming, and characterized by a high access threshold. Web-based interventions may overcome some of these problems yet the evidence in this field is scarce. This paper describes the protocol for a study that will examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based guided stress-management training which is based on problem solving and emotion regulation and aimed at reducing stress in adult employees.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The study will target stressed employees aged 18 and older. A randomized controlled trial (RCT) design will be applied. Based on a power calculation of d=.35 (1-&#x003b2; of 80%, &#x003b1; = .05), 264 participants will be recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a six-month waitlist control group. Inclusion criteria include an elevated stress level (Cohen&#x02019;s Perceived Stress Scale-10 &#x02265; 22) and current employment. Exclusion criteria include risk of suicide or previously diagnosed psychosis or dissociative symptoms. The primary outcome will be perceived stress, and secondary outcomes include depression and anxiety. Data will be collected at baseline and seven weeks and six months after randomization. An extended follow up at 12 months is planned for the intervention group. Moreover, a cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted from a societal perspective and will include both direct and indirect health care costs. Data will be analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis and per protocol.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>The substantial negative consequences of work-related stress emphasize the necessity for effective stress-management trainings. If the proposed internet intervention proves to be (cost-) effective, a preventative, economical stress-management tool will be conceivable.

Shorter periods of work-related stress elicit acute stress reactions but are not hazardous to health and can even enhance the workers&#x02019; ability to meet challenges at work. However, if stress passes into a chronic state of tension, serious negative health consequences can result [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>].</p><p>The prevalence rate of stress in employees varies considerably depending on several factors, such as the definition of stress, the measurement that is used or the occupation of the workers. A European survey of 21,703 workers showed that 28% of workers experience work-related stress, and the percentages range from 17% in elementary occupations to 40% in professionals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>A meta-analysis found that job strain and effort-reward imbalances produce consistent increases in the risks for common mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Work stress may precipitate diagnosable depression and anxiety in workers who were previously healthy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Furthermore, sleep disturbances are a common negative consequence of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>]. Moreover, work-related stress can have adverse effects on a societal level due to sickness leave [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>] and work disability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. According to the American Institute of Stress, the cost estimates of job stress amount to &#x0201c;over $300 billion annually due to increased absenteeism, employee turnover, diminished productivity, medical, legal, and insurance expenses, and workers' compensation payments.&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>]</p><p>A variety of effective traditional occupational stress-management trainings are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. An extensive meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>] showed that the effectiveness of these trainings varies depending on the type of intervention and outcome measure applied. The efficacy of these interventions ranges from d=.11 (the effect of relaxation on depression) to d=.70 (the effect of cognitive behavioral therapy on anxiety) and the overall effect size across all studies is d=.34. However, occupational stress-management interventions are often taught to only a small group of people who are guided by an instructor and these interventions take place at a specific location [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>].</p><p>Compared to face-to-face interventions, web-based guided self-help interventions offer the advantages of being independent of time, location and group. Furthermore, web-based guided self-help interventions have shown moderate to large effect sizes in numerous studies of, for example, depression and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. A number of randomized controlled trials on web-based stress-management interventions have been performed, including studies on general populations of people with stress-related complaints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] or work-related stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>], college students [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>], women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>], families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B19">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref>], and individuals with burnout symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>]. Thereby, the effect sizes for studies that use stress as an outcome measure vary from non-significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to moderate (d = .60) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. However, only few studies have investigated the potential of web-based stress-management interventions in employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. These studies of employees apply a wide range of outcome measures, including stress, depression, anxiety, and physiological measurements. With regard to the respective outcome measure, the results again vary between non-significant for stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>] to moderate for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>].</p><p>To date, the cost-effectiveness of worksite mental health interventions has been studied only in a limited number of trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. A recent systematic review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>] found that these interventions might be cost-effective; however, more high-quality economic evaluations are needed to draw firm conclusions. Data on cost-effectiveness has not been presented in any of the afore-mentioned studies on web-based stress-management for employees. For web-based interventions, studies currently investigate the cost-effectiveness of mental health interventions for workers, including studies of a workers&#x02019; health surveillance mental module [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>] and a guided self-help course for workers with depressive symptoms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no studies with full economic evaluations of the cost-effectiveness of web-based stress-management training for employees.</p><p>The theoretical basis of web-based interventions for stress is diverse and ranges from cognitive behavioral methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>], mindfulness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>], problem solving [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>], social cognitive theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>] to health behavior change theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. Surprisingly however, there are currently no web-based interventions with content based on specific stress models, such as the job-demand control model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>], the effort-reward imbalance model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>] or more generic models of stress, such as the transactional model of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. Lazarus&#x02019; transactional model of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] can be applied to working contexts and other life areas. This model identifies two strategies of coping with stressors: problem- and emotion-oriented coping. Some web-based stress-management interventions have already included problem solving as part of their intervention content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] or as stand-alone interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]. However, web-based stress-management interventions employing a combination of problem- and emotion-oriented coping methods currently do not exist.</p><p>At work, people often must not only cope with difficult situations and solve problems but also face challenging emotions that arise from these situations. Deficits in emotion regulation skills are an important factor in the development and maintenance of a broad range of mental disorders, such as depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. As deficits in the ability to adaptively cope with difficult emotions are related to various mental health problems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>], the usage of emotion regulation techniques in a low-threshold web-based stress-management training to reduce symptoms of distress appears promising.</p><p>The available web-based stress-management interventions cover a wide range of primary treatment components, including several cognitive behavioral methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>]. In addition, some interventions focus not only on stress but also on health behavior problems such as alcohol abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>] and unhealthy diets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]. A meta-analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] found that occupational stress-management interventions that focus on fewer treatment components are more effective than interventions that include several components. The authors of this meta-analysis found combined effect sizes of d=.64 and d=.61 for the effectiveness of interventions with one or two treatment components, respectively; and treatments with four or more components yielded a smaller effect size of d=.27 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, it appears promising to opt for fewer intervention components in stress-management interventions.</p><sec><title>Aims of the study and hypotheses</title><p>In this study, we will investigate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed web-based stress-management training for stressed employees that is based on problem solving and emotion regulation. As a theoretical basis we have followed the transactional stress model of Richard Lazarus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. We hypothesize that participants in the intervention group will show a greater reduction in the primary outcome perceived stress from pre-test to post-test compared to a waitlist control group, and that this effect will be maintained over six months. We will conduct cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses from a societal perspective and hypothesize that the intervention will be cost-effective. Furthermore, explorative moderator analyses will be conducted.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Study design</title><p>A randomized controlled trial with two conditions will be conducted.

There will be no restriction with regard to the use of medication or other treatment as usual (TAU) (e.g., psychotherapy) in either of the groups. To control for potential confounding effects, TAU will be monitored.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Figure 1</label><caption><p>Study flow chart.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="1471-2458-13-655-1"/></fig></sec><sec><title>Inclusion and exclusion criteria</title><p>The target group will consist of stressed employees from the general working population aged 18 years or older. Inclusion criteria will include current employment and a distinct level of perceived stress as indicated by scores of 22 and above on the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10). This cut-off was chosen to select participants with a marked level of subjective stress as identified by one standard deviation (SD = 6.2) above the mean (PSS-10 = 15.3) in a large working population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B42">42</xref>]. Applicants with an elevated risk of suicide (Beck Suicide Item &#x0003e; 1) and applicants that self-report having been diagnosed with psychosis or dissociative symptoms in the past will be excluded. For applicants that are at risk for suicide we follow a standardized procedure. These applicants will be advised to seek help via their general practitioner, the local psychiatric emergency room or an official emergency number, and the relevant information and telephone numbers will be provided by email.</p></sec><sec><title>Procedure</title><p>Participants will be recruited from the general working population via mass media (e.g., newspaper articles, television) between March and October 2013. Moreover, a major health insurance company (BARMER GEK) will support the recruitment process within their occupational health management program. On an open access website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geton-training.de">http://www.geton-training.de</ext-link>) the interested people will be able to sign up to participate with an email-address. Applicants will receive further informational material concerning the study conditions and the training and will be asked to provide an email-address and a first and last name (which can be pseudonyms if desired) to participate. Afterwards, a link to the screening questionnaire will be sent. Applicants who are eligible for participation will be required to provide their informed consent and fill out the online baseline questionnaire. Subsequently, these participants will be randomly allocated to either the intervention or the control group. Participants will be informed of the outcome of the randomization and participants in the intervention group will receive immediate access to the GET.ON Stress training. Assessments will be scheduled at seven weeks and six months after randomization for both groups. However, the participants in the control group will receive the login data required to complete the training six months later than the intervention group. An extended follow-up for the intervention group is scheduled 12 months post-randomization.</p></sec><sec><title>Randomization</title><p>The randomization will be carried out by an independent researcher using a web-based randomization program (randomisation.eu) that will be set to allocate participants (N=264) into each group at a ratio of 1:1.</p></sec><sec><title>Sample size</title><p>We aim to include 264 participants to produce a statistically relevant effect size of d = .35, a power (1-&#x003b2;) of 80% and an alpha of .05 (two-tailed test) for intention-to-treat analysis using PASS 12. A comprehensive meta-analysis on traditional face-to-face interventions for work-related stress yielded an overall combined effect size of d=.34, whereby the results for web-based stress-management interventions are mixed, ranging from non-significant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>] to moderate effect sizes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. Therefore, we aim for an effect size of d=.35.</p></sec><sec><title>Intervention</title><p>The web-based GET.ON Stress intervention is based on two main components: problem solving and emotion regulation. The intervention consists of seven sessions composed of modules for psycho-education (session 1), problem solving (sessions 2&#x02013;3), emotion regulation (sessions 4&#x02013;6) and plan for the future (session 7) (see Table&#x000a0;<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref>). Each session can be completed in approximately 45&#x02013;60 minutes and consists of general information, examples related to work, interactive exercises, quizzes, audio and video files, and downloadable work sheets and mp3 files. We will recommend to log in once or twice a week and to fill out a short daily stress diary. Depending on the module, further homework will be assigned. Using responsive web-design, participants can follow the program on the internet, a tablet or mobile phone. An integrated read-aloud function allows participants to follow the lessons in an audio-narrated way.</p><table-wrap position="float" id="T1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Content of the GET.ON stress training</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups" border="1"><colgroup><col align="left"/><col align="left"/><col align="left"/></colgroup><thead valign="top"><tr><th align="left"><bold>Session</bold></th><th align="left"><bold>Intervention content</bold></th><th align="left">&#x000a0;</th></tr></thead><tbody valign="top"><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">1<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Psycho-education<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">&#x000a0;<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">2<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Problem solving I<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Learning Phase)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">3<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Problem solving II<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Maintenance Phase)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">4<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Emotion regulation I<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Muscle- and breathing relaxation)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">5<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Emotion regulation II<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Acceptance and tolerance of emotions)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">6<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Emotion regulation III<hr/></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(Effective self-support in difficult situations)<hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">7</td><td align="left">Plan for the future</td><td align="left">&#x000a0;</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec><title>Psycho-education (session 1)</title><p>In the first session, the participants will be provided with psycho-educational information about stress based on Lazarus&#x02019; transactional model of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>], that includes emotion-focused and problem-focused coping strategies. Following a video introduction to the basic information about stress and coping methods, an interactive quiz will be presented to equip participants with general knowledge of the most appropriate coping strategies for common problem situations. The participants will identify their personal stressors and define their goals and motivation during the training. Furthermore, participants will be asked to choose one positive activity each day.</p></sec><sec><title>Problem solving (session 2&#x02013;3)</title><p>In sessions 2 and 3, the participants will work on their problem-solving skills. This module is based on problem solving therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B43">43</xref>]. The participants will learn a systematic six-step problem-solving method that can be applied to their individual problems. This method has already been adopted in other web-based studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B44">44</xref>]. Typical scenarios involving work-related stress will be presented. The participants will fill out their own six-step procedures and use their personal solution in the time between the sessions. In session 3, the participants will have the opportunity to either work on the same problem as in the previous session or choose a new problem.</p></sec><sec><title>Emotion regulation (session 4&#x02013;6)</title><p>In sessions 4 to 6, the participants will work on the emotion regulation module. The emotion regulation techniques are based on the Affect Regulation Training (ART) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B45">45</xref>] and include muscle and breathing relaxation, acceptance and tolerance of emotions and effective self-support. ART has been shown to be effective as additional treatment component in cognitive-behavioral treatment for depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>] and also as stand-alone intervention in at risk-populations (i.e., police officers) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B46">46</xref>]. In each session, one strategy will be taught, and the participants will practice that strategy with a 15-minute audio file according to the instruction of an expert. The techniques will be introduced using examples of typical emotional reactions related to work contexts. Video files explaining the psychological background will be displayed. The participants will be asked to listen to the appropriate 15-minute audio file on a daily basis and will be provided with downloadable mp3 files.</p></sec><sec><title>Plan for the future (session 7)</title><p>In the last session, the participants will be asked to reassess their goals for the training. Furthermore, they will identify their personal warning signs for stress. Additionally, they will be asked to strengthen something important in their lives and write a letter to themselves about how they imagine their life will be after four weeks of applying the stress-management methods they have been trained in.</p></sec><sec><title>Optional booster session</title><p>Four weeks after completing the training, the participants will be given the option of completing a booster session and evaluating their training progress. They will be given the opportunities to evaluate the letter they wrote to themselves in the last training session, reassess their goals and make plans to continue to include positive activities in their daily lives.</p></sec><sec><title>Additional information</title><p>At the end of sessions 2 to 6, information and exercise sections about common stress-related topics will be provided to enhance the recognition value of the stress-management training. These sections are optional and will not be part of the main intervention. These sections will cover the following topics: time management, rumination and worrying, psychological detachment from work, sleep hygiene, rhythm and regularity of sleeping habits, nutrition and exercise, organization of breaks during work, and social support.</p></sec><sec><title>Text message coach</title><p>If desired, participants will receive automatic motivational text messages and small exercises on their mobile phones. These messages will support the participant in transferring the exercises of the training into their daily lives (e.g., short relaxation exercises: &#x0201c;Relax your muscles in your hands and arms for 3 seconds now. Follow your breathing and each time you breathe out, relax a little more&#x0201c;). The participants will have the opportunity to choose between &#x0201c;light coach&#x0201d; (one text message every other day) and &#x0201c;intensive coach&#x0201d; (2&#x02013;3 text messages every day) options.</p></sec><sec><title>eCoach support</title><p>Within 48 hours, the participants will receive personalized written feedback on the exercises they have completed in each session from an eCoach. The eCoaches are psychologists and trained master&#x02019;s-level psychology students and will follow guidelines about the feedback process that are defined according to the standardized manual for the intervention. The eCoaches will send reminders in cases in which the participants do not complete one session within 7 days. The training itself, and the communication between the participant and the eCoach will take place in a secured web-based platform (AES 256-bit encryption).

In secondary analyses, we will explore the effects of depression, anxiety, emotional exhaustion, emotion regulation, attitudes toward seeking professional psychological help, work engagement, psychological detachment, insomnia severity, worrying, and absenteeism/presenteeism. Economic analyses will be conducted assessing cost-effectiveness and cost-utility from a societal perspective including the costs of all types of health services and the costs that stem from productivity losses.</p></sec><sec><title>Outcome measures</title><sec><title>Perceived stress</title><p>The German version of the ten-item-Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>] will be used as a primary outcome measure. The PSS is &#x0201c;the most widely used instrument for measuring perceived stress&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>] and assesses the degree to which people perceive their lives as stressful, particularly regarding how &#x0201c;unpredictable, uncontrollable and overloading respondents find their lives&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. Cronbach&#x02019;s alphas range for this scale from .78 to .91 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B49">49</xref>]. The scale is based on Lazarus&#x02019; transactional model of stress and, therefore, fits well with the theoretical basis of the intervention. Participants in this study will be asked to answer questions relating to the past week as opposed to the past month to avoid confounding with the training period. Similar procedures have been adopted in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B48">48</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Depression</title><p>Depressive symptoms will be measured with the German version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies&#x02019; Depression Scale (CES-D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B50">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B51">51</xref>]. This frequently used self-report instrument consists of 20 items that are answered on a four-point Likert scale referring to the previous week. Total scores range from 0 to 60.

The subscales of acceptance, emotional self-support and comprehension will be included to assess the usage of general emotion regulation skills during the previous week and measured on a five-point Likert-type scale (ranging from &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;almost always&#x0201d;). Each scale is comprised of three items. The overall Cronbach&#x02019;s &#x003b1; of the ERSQ-27 was .90 in a community-based sample, and for the subscales of acceptance, emotional self-support and comprehension .68, .72 and .73, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B57">57</xref>]. Furthermore, the subscale &#x0201c;general distress&#x0201d; from the emotion-specific version of the ERSQ (ERSQ-ES) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B58">58</xref>] will be used to assess the regulation of stress. Therefore, the general distress subscale containing 12 items will be applied to assess constructive coping with stress and tension within the last week on a five-point Likert-type scale (ranging from &#x0201c;not at all&#x0201d; to &#x0201c;always&#x0201d;).

We expect that the stress levels of participants in the intervention group will be significantly lower after the training and after six months compared to these measures from the control group. Furthermore, we expect this intervention to be cost-effective.</p><p>The intervention content of the stress training was developed with a clear theoretical background based on Lazarus&#x02019; transactional model of stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. A recent study of a web-based intervention aimed at reducing stress provides psycho-educational information about problem- and emotion-focused coping in one out of 13 training sessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. However, there are currently no web-based stress-management interventions that have used the combination of problem- and emotion-focused coping based on the definitions of Lazarus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>] as the main theoretical basis. In the research on stress, problem-oriented coping methods such as the problem-solving training have always been strongly emphasized. In addition, many interventions include cognitive restructuring as a treatment component. With this focus, emotions are only addressed indirectly as a sub-area of cognitions. Recently, deficits in emotion regulation skills as a treatment target have gained attention in the field of mental health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>]. Emotion regulation has been shown to be relevant in a broad range of mental disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B41">41</xref>] including depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>] and anxiety [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B40">40</xref>]. Only now, the targeting of emotions as an autonomous treatment component finds its way into stress-management training formats. A study in hypertensive employees found that a stress-management intervention consisting of positive emotion refocusing and emotional restructuring techniques can improve stress, depression, emotional health and systolic blood pressure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B84">84</xref>]. Furthermore, an intervention designed to increase emotional competence has been found to result in decreased perceived stress and lower cortisol secretion in adulthood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B85">85</xref>]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no web-based stress-management training available that has included emotion regulation as main treatment component. Thus, the web-based training proposed herein includes emotion regulation as an innovative and promising component in addition to the traditional, established component of problem solving.</p><p>The inclusion of an economic evaluation constitutes a strong advantage of this study. There are a limited number of economic evaluations of worksite mental health interventions available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. The afore-mentioned RCTs on web-based interventions for managing stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>] have not included full economic evaluations.</p><p>A number of studies of web-based stress-management interventions have been undertaken; however, little is known about moderators of treatment outcome. It is essential to know for which people with which personal characteristics, which training is most effective under what circumstances in order to optimize training circumstances for each individual based on his or her personal characteristics. Therefore, we include a variety of measurements that are assumed to be related to stress, such as emotion regulation skills [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B86">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B87">87</xref>], sleep disturbances [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>], psychological detachment or worrying [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B88">88</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B89">89</xref>].</p><sec><title>Strengths</title><p>A major strength of the current study is the robust randomized controlled trial design, which is the gold standard for clinical trials. Furthermore, this is the first study in Germany to examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a web-based stress-management intervention. We also include a large number of participants in this study to ensure sufficient power.</p></sec><sec><title>Limitations and future directions</title><p>One limitation of this study is that no objective measurement of stress (e.g., cortisol levels) will be included. Due to feasibility limitations, only self-report measurements will be examined. Although self-reports always carry the risk of introducing subjective biases, it has been suggested that replacing self-reports with stress-related physiological measurements is not promising [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>]. However, the completion of self-reports can be complemented with other measurements to provide more reliable data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B90">90</xref>].</p><p>Another limitation of the proposed study is the potential self-selection bias. Participants will be eligible to apply for the intervention if they experience work-related stress. One must assume that the individuals who participate in this study possess certain characteristics. Therefore, the results of the current trial will only be applicable to persons who select themselves for this stress-management training.</p><p>For future studies it is worthwhile to investigate how much support is needed within the training to achieve the optimal trade-off between treatment outcome and economical costs, i.e., to maximize treatment outcome and simultaneously maintain the lowest level of support possible. A meta-analysis showed that interventions without an eCoach can be effective; however, the effect sizes without an eCoach are much smaller than those of interventions with an eCoach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. The current training includes a personal feedback from an eCoach after each of the seven sessions. It would be interesting to examine the size of the treatment effects that result from the application of other, less intensive and more economical support concepts, such as feedback on demand.</p><p>In the current trial, we will examine the efficacy of a guided self-help training in comparison to a waitlist control group. This design is therefore not suited to draw any conclusions regarding the effectiveness of the training compared to a face-to-face training, as has been examined elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>]. In a systematic review and meta-analysis, guided self-help programs for depression and anxiety have been found to have effects similar to those of face-to-face therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B91">91</xref>]; thus, an investigation of the efficacy of a face-to-face version of the training compared to the web-based training would be worthwhile.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>This study aims to evaluate the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a newly developed stress-management training for employees.
