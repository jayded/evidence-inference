A large portion of adhesive SBO resolve by nonoperative methods such as fasting and ingestion of an oral contrast-media, while a significant number of patients will need emergency surgery
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. For decades open surgery has been the gold standard in treating adhesive SBO. Now that laparoscopic surgery has been established as a first line option in many elective indications such as colorectal surgery, fundoplication, and cholecystectomy for example, laparoscopy is emerging also as a viable alternative in emergency surgery.</p><p>If SBO is caused by one adhesive band, the surgical treatment is straightforward - cutting the band causing obstruction. Laparoscopic approach seems ideal for such a procedure, preventing the morbidity of a laparotomy incision. First publications describing laparoscopic adhesiolysis in SBO are from the 1990&#x02019;s
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. Since then several retrospective series have been published, and a recent meta-analysis pooled patients from four studies, including a total of 334 patients
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Meta-analysis showed that patients treated by the laparoscopic approach had less complications, and faster return of bowel function
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. However, there are no prospective randomized trials comparing open approach to laparoscopy. Furthermore, previous retrospective studies have a selection bias because the easiest cases are selected for laparoscopic approach. One of the drawbacks of laparoscopic approach is a concern for iatrogenic bowel perforation. In one report, the rate of bowel lesion in laparoscopic adhesiolysis was 6.6%, and only 84% were detected during the operation
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Objective</title><p>The objective of this trial is to compare open surgery to laparoscopic adhesiolysis in patients with computed tomography-diagnosed adhesive SBO that is not resolved by nonoperative means. The hypothesis is that laparoscopic approach shortens the length of hospital stay without increasing complications.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and permissions</title><p>This study will be conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and &#x02018;good clinical practice&#x02019; guidelines. The research plan has been evaluated and approved by the local institutional ethics committee of the main research center (Helsinki University Central Hospital, Ethics Committee, Department of Surgery). The research plan has further been approved by each participating centers&#x02019; institutional review board (Helsinki University Central Hospital, Vaasa Central Hospital, Turku University Hospital, Oulu University Hospital, Tampere University Hospital, P&#x000e4;ij&#x000e4;t-H&#x000e4;me Central Hospital).

If no exclusion criteria are present, nasogastric tube is inserted and the patient is admitted to the emergency surgery ward. If the obstruction does not resolve within 12 hours, an oral water-soluble contrast (Gastrografin&#x000ae;) is used. If the contrast has not advanced to the colon within 8 hours and the patient has no signs of spontaneous resolution of obstruction, surgical intervention is considered necessary and the patient is randomized to either open or laparoscopic surgery. The oral water-soluble contrast study has been shown to have 97% sensitivity and 96% specificity in predicting nonoperative resolution of adhesive SBO
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Patients can alternatively undergo nonoperative management by fasting and nasogastric tube only if oral water-soluble contrast is contraindicated or not available. If SBO in these patients is not resolved within 48 hours, they are included in the study (Figure&#x000a0;

Subsequent ports are inserted under direct vision. The location of the ports is left to the surgeons discretion. The abdominal cavity is inspected and the caecum located and identified. Laparoscopic forceps are used to examine the small bowel starting from the terminal ileum until the transition site is identified. Dilated small bowel loops are not grasped, but can be mobilized by grasping the mesenterium. Once the transition site is identified, the obstructing adhesions are divided and the bowel is inspected for vitality. Ports are removed under vision, and possible bleeding is primarily controlled by ligatures. The fascial holes of ports over 5 mm are closed.

Proton pump inhibitors are used for the length of the hospital stay. Trombosis profylaxis is commenced 6 hours after surgery, if there is no suspicion of postoperative hemorrhage.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. It has been suggested that purulent peritonitis caused by acute diverticulitis can be treated by laparoscopic lavage
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>], and randomized studies are on their way to either prove or disprove this approach
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>].</p><p>As laparoscopic surgery is becoming more common in emergency surgery, adhesive SBO is the obvious next target for a laparoscopic approach
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Although there are several retrospective series, and meta-analyses comparing open approach to laparoscopy, there are no prospective, randomized studies. A search for ongoing trials reveals that, except for this trial, there are no other prospective, randomized trials enrolling patients at the moment of writing. Although previous retrospective series have shown association of less complications and shorter hospital stay with the laparoscopic approach, all previous retrospective series are more or less biased as the easiest cases are selected for laparoscopic approach.</p><p>This trial aims to provide level Ib evidence for the use of laparoscopy in the treatment of adhesive SBO that is not resolving by conservative means. Two large meta-analyses have shown that the advancement of oral contrast agent (Gastrografin) to the colon predicts that the obstruction would resolve with 0.97 sensitivity and 0.96 speficity
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Optimal timing of the abdominal radiograph to predict the success of nonoperative management is unknown
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. In this study, the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratios for waiting 4&#x02013;8 hours were similar to waiting 24 hours before abdominal radiograph is carried out
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]. Thus, there appears to be no advantage of waiting more than 4&#x02013;8 hours. In this trial, if the oral contrast agent is not detected in the colon after 8 hours the conservative management is considered a failure and operative management is warranted. Further, the intestine is decompressed using a nasogastric tube for a minimum of 12 hours before commencing the oral contrast agent study. Thus, in total, the nonoperative management trial takes at minimum 20 hours.</p><p>Because there are several exclusion criteria in this trial, the patients are selected, and the results will not be applicable to all patients presenting with an adhesive SBO. These exclusion criteria, however, should not be regarded as absolute contraindications for laparoscopic approach. Many of the exclusion criteria are relative contraindications (peritonitis, suspicion of other cause than adhesions, pregnancy, wide diffuse adhesions, peritoneal carcinosis) or predictors of failure of laparoscopic approach (endometriosis, earlier generalized peritonitis, over 3 open procedures, radiotherapy, vascular procedures)
[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Furthermore, earlier obesity surgery is an indication for laparoscopic approach, and these patients are excluded because we do not think it is ethical to randomize them for open approach. Some of the exclusion criteria (age &#x0003e;95 years, earlier abdominal surgery within 30 days, patient living in an institutional care, or prior hospital stay of over 1 week) were included to reduce the morbidity of the patients included in the study, as inclusion of a few of these patients in one of the arms would create a strong bias (i.e. the length of stay would be longer because of the morbidity of the patients, not because of the approach used).</p><p>The trial has been recruiting since summer 2013. Enrollment of the patients is estimated to last for 4&#x02013;5 years and primary end-point results are estimated to be available in 2018.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>SBO: Small bowel obstruction.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>VS, PM, AL drafted the manuscript.
