Most tracks are pes tracks (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;25) that are very small, average 22.29&#x02009;mm long and 12.46&#x02009;mm wide. The pes tracks show &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; lizard morphology as having curved digit imprints that progressively increase in length from digits I to IV, a smaller digit V that is separated from the other digits by a large interdigital angle. The manus track is 19.18&#x02009;mm long and 19.23&#x02009;mm wide, and shows a different morphology from the pes. The predominant pes tracks, the long stride length of pes, narrow trackway width, digitigrade manus and pes prints, and anteriorly oriented long axis of the fourth pedal digit indicate that these trackways were made by lizards running bipedally, suggesting that bipedality was possible early in lizard evolution.</p></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p id="Par2">Although lizards are the most successful of modern reptiles in terms of the number of species (more than 5,800 extant species) and their wide geographical distribution<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref></sup>, their fossil record is relatively poor with respect to both skeletons and tracks. It is, in general, because their small bodies require a suitable depositional environment for preservation. Crown-group Squamata originated between the Late Triassic and the Early Jurassic (213~176&#x02009;Ma) based on molecules and fossils<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref></sup>. Some skeletal materials of Iguania, Gekkota, Scincoidea, Lacertoidea, and Anguimorpha have been reported in Asia, Europe, and North America by the Early Cretaceous<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref></sup>. Unfortunately, fossil footprint records attributable to lizards are even rarer than those of body fossils because of the general light body weight of lizards and their preferred range of habitats<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref></sup>. There are thus far only three previous reports of fossil lizard tracks. Two were attributed to a lizard without a description from the Eocene Green River Formation, Utah: one is a lizard trackway<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref></sup> and the other is one isolated track<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref></sup>. A new lizard trackway, <italic>Neosauroides koreaensis</italic>, was recently named from the Haman Formation (Late Albian~Early Cenomanian) of South Korea<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par3">Here we describe the oldest crown-group lizard trackways known anywhere in the world which show bipedal locomotion. Tracks come from the Hasandong Formation (Aptian~early Albian)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref></sup>, South Korea which are extraordinarily well-preserved and allow identification of detailed foot anatomy. Associated with a complete manus imprint, most tracks are very small (less than 26&#x02009;mm) and appear as ectaxonic (i.e., longer fourth digit) and asymmetrical imprints which are frequently recognized as a diagnostic feature of the &#x0201c;typical&#x0201d; lizard pes<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref></sup>. Many modern lizards can bipedally run on the land and even on the surface of water (e.g., the &#x0201c;Jesus lizard&#x0201d;, <italic>Basiliscus basiliscus</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref></sup>. However, it has been unclear as to when lizards developed a capability for bipedal locomotion, though bipedal locomotion has been inferred in some fossil lizards based on the relationship between forelimb and hind limb lengths (e.g., <italic>Tijubina pontei</italic>)<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref></sup>. Therefore, the discovery described in this report is highly significant because it is the first direct evidence of bipedal locomotion in fossil lizards, suggesting that lizard bipedality is deeply rooted in the phylogeny of lizard evolution.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Systematic ichnology</title><p id="Par4">Order Squamata Oppel, 1811</p><p id="Par5"><italic>Sauripes hadongensis</italic> ichnogen. et ichnosp. nov.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>Etymology</title><p id="Par6">Ichnogenus named from ancient Greek &#x0201c;sauros&#x0201d; (lizard) and &#x0201c;pes&#x0201d; (foot).

One type (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;25, pes tracks) has curved digit imprints that progressively increase in length from digits I to IV, a smaller digit V that is distinctly separated from the other digits by a large interdigital angle, and digit V is oriented more laterally. The other type (N&#x02009;=&#x02009;4, manus tracks) is mesaxonic, having a longer digit III compared to the others (digits I, II, IV, V). The average manus and pes length is 19.18&#x02009;mm and 22.29&#x02009;mm, respectively (heteropody). Although manus-pes sets are not regularly imprinted, the tracks visible on the slab clearly show locomotion patterns without tail trails.</p><p id="Par12">Of the four manus tracks, one in trackway B (B1, Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig2" ref-type="fig">2a</xref>) is better preserved than the other manus tracks in trackway A (A10) and trackway B (B3, B4). It has five digits which appear nearly straight except for digit V which is strongly curved medially. All digit impressions are very narrow (less than 1&#x02009;mm). The digit I (7.58&#x02009;mm long) and II (11.91&#x02009;mm long) imprints are anteromedially oriented, whereas those of digit III (13.64&#x02009;mm long) are oriented anterolaterally, digit IV (12.69&#x02009;mm long) laterally, and digit V (6.84&#x02009;mm long) posterolaterally. Therefore, the divarication of digit I and V impressions is very wide (134.42&#x000b0;). The distal ends of digit III and IV show slightly curved claw marks. The metacarpal depression is small and slightly raised compared to the digital impressions. There is no indication of webbing between the digits.<fig id="Fig2"><label>Figure 2</label><caption><p>Manus and pes tracks of <italic>Sauripes hadongensis</italic>, n. ichnogen., n. ichnosp.

Trackways A and B slightly overlap in the opposite direction, indicating a short time interval between two formations. They consist of ten left and right tracks, respectively, while trackways C and D preserve four right tracks, respectively, on the slab (Supplementary Information Table S1). Pes prints are predominant in all trackways, so it is not easy to recognize a normal quadrupedal gait pattern, comprising manus and pes prints. The manus gait-width is narrower than the pes gait-width as seen in the trackways of extant lacertids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref></sup> and varanids<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref></sup>. Trackway A is the longest and best preserved among the four trackways, comprising one incomplete right manus and nine pes prints (4 left and 5 right). The average pes stride length is 79.18&#x02009;mm and the average pace length is 47.82&#x02009;mm with 112.88&#x000b0; as pace angulation.

Lizards exhibit different gaits, from quadrupedal and bipedal species to terrestrial and arboreal specialists. Lizard locomotion is strongly influenced by body shape and length, as well as by differences in habitat<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Nevertheless, four forms of gait; a quadrupedal walk at low speeds, a quadrupedal fast gait, a diagonal run at high speeds, and the bipedal run (e.g., <italic>Basiliscus basiliscus</italic>) are recognized for locomotion in lizards<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref></sup>. Many lizards (more than 50 species) are known to have the capability for bipedal locomotion<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>. Although some lizards appear to run bipedally without acceleration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref></sup>, bipedality usually occurs as a consequence of acceleration in a lizard with hind limbs that are significantly longer than the forelimbs, moving the center of mass, and the rotational force on the hip joints<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref></sup>. When lizards are moving at relatively slow speeds, they retain a sprawling limb posture with laterally oriented plantigrade feet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. With this locomotor pattern, the front feet are positioned under the body with the head up, increasing the chance of leaving manus imprints rather than pes ones as seen in <italic>Neosauroides koreanesis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref></sup>. In contrast, <italic>Sauripes hadongensis</italic> shows pes-dominant trackways characterized by long strides, a large pace angulation, and digitigrade prints throughout the locomotion sequences. Snyder pointed out that long hind limbs, short forelimbs, a narrow pelvis and a long tail could aid bipedality in lizards, mostly through increased stride length<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. Running lizards at high speeds frequently also leave digitigrade footprints rather than plantigrade ones<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par16"><italic>S</italic>. <italic>hadongensis</italic> has better defined impressions of the digits than of the sole pads, with distinctly deep metatarsophalangeal joint in digits II, III, and IV, behind which the sediment is slightly pushed up, indicating that they ran mainly on the digits, instead of touching the whole soles plantar surface on the substrate (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig3" ref-type="fig">3</xref>). At fast speeds, the long axis of the fourth toe is nearly parallel to the direction of movement, generating a great proportion of the forces<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref></sup>, as is clearly shown in trackway A and B (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>). However, the extant and fossil lizard pes prints in walking trackways show strong outward rotation by outwardly rotated feet<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref></sup>. Two trackways show evidence of increasing speed based on the increasing stride length and pace angulation (Supplementary Information Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">S1</xref>). The trackway width is getting narrow in the trackways A and B because the hind limbs are more fully straightened as they attain a bipedal posture and a higher hip position<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref></sup> (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig4" ref-type="fig">4</xref>).</p><p id="Par17">In trackway B, three successive manus prints (B1, B3, and B4) are preserved before the transition to bipedal locomotion. The lizard is the only vertebrate animal that starts on all limb pairs, then transitions to the bipedal gait by acceleration<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref></sup>. B1 has the best preservation amongst the three, which shows a complete manus imprint including metacarpal depression. On the other hand, B3 and B4 have only two or three incomplete distal digit imprints. The first bipedal stride by acceleration in lizards increases trunk angle, hence increases forelimb clearance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref></sup>. The locomotor behaviour of the lizards that left trackways in the Hasandong Formation is similar to the experimental observations for the bipedal running of <italic>Dipsosaurus dorsalis</italic> and <italic>Callisaurus draconoides</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref></sup>. Therefore, consideration of all the evidence above strongly suggests that <italic>S</italic>. <italic>hadongensis</italic> was made by lizards transitioning to their hind limbs during locomotion and becoming bipedal.</p><p id="Par18">For the most part, bipedality has been related to fast locomotion and to predator avoidance<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref></sup>. Bipedality in lizards may be advantageous for enhanced environmental perception during locomotion by elevating the head and expanding the visual field during obstacle negotiation<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref></sup>. It is not certain whether <italic>S</italic>. <italic>hadongensis</italic> tracks were made when escaping from predators or not, but interestingly, the pterosaur track <italic>Pteraichnus koreanensis</italic> was reported from the same horizon at the same site<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.

Most bones occur as scattered, broken, and isolated pieces which had probably undergone long aerial exposure, transportation, and scattering on the floodplain before burial<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref></sup>. Previously described vertebrate ichnofossils from the Hasandong Formation include dinosaur tracks<sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref></sup> and pterosaur tracks of <italic>Pteraichnus koreanensis</italic><sup><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref></sup>.</p><p id="Par22">The lizard track site is from an abandoned quarry next to the Hadong power plant, Hadong County where there is approximately 5,000&#x02009;m<sup>2</sup> of exposure, representing the middle part of the Hasandong Formation (Supplementary Information Fig. S<xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>). The lizard trackways occur in the same horizon as the pterosaur ichnotaxon, <italic>Pteraichnus koreanensis</italic>, which comprises a dark grey mudstone layer in the middle part of the section. This layer also produces dinosaur tracks and plant fossils (<italic>Ptilphylum</italic> sp., <italic>Cladophlebis</italic> sp., <italic>Ruffordia</italic> sp.), presenting sediments thought to have been deposited in small swamps and/or marginal lakes associated with floodplains between channels.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec14"><p>
