EC-MPS and MMF improve the outcome of severe lupus nephritis (LN) and have fewer side&#x000a0;effects than pulsed intravenous cyclophosphamide. Blood concentrations of mycophenolic acid (MPA), the active metabolite of EC-MPS, vary between participants despite fixed dosing. Interpatient variability has been studied in transplantation, but not well documented in LN. The relationship between MPA concentration and its clinical effect on LN has not been described.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods and analysis</title><p>This is a prospective, open-label, randomised controlled trial. &#x02013;32 participants with LN who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be randomised into two groups: one receiving a fixed dose of EC-MPS and the second, a dosing regimen that is titrated with therapeutic drug monitoring. Included participants will have blood sampled over a period of 8&#x02013;12&#x02005;h on three different occasions. Pharmacokinetic parameters will be calculated using non-compartmental methods.</p></sec><sec><title>Ethics and dissemination</title><p>The Human Research and Ethics Committee of the Royal Brisbane Women's Hospital have approved this study.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> The clearance of MPA depends on its non-protein bound fraction.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R26">26</xref> Therefore, patients with reduced renal function and hypoalbuminaemia have higher free fractions of MPA, theoretically resulting in higher MPA clearance and a lower MPA exposure.

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R29">29</xref> reported on the value of measuring MPA plasma concentrations in patients with autoimmune diseases. In their study, there was a weak correlation between the 12&#x02005;h trough (C0) MPA concentrations and the area under the curve (AUC), with remission being associated with higher MPA trough concentrations (&#x02265;3.5&#x02005;mg/L). There was a clustering of adverse events in participants with a high MPA exposure, thus refining the therapeutic window. In contrast, studies in renal transplant participants showed tolerability correlated poorly with MPA concentrations. Neumann <italic>et al</italic> proposed in their exploratory study that MPA trough levels between 3.5 and 4.5&#x02005;mg/L be used for maintenance of remission and prevention of adverse events. Roland <italic>et al</italic>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R30">30</xref> in a prospective pharmacokinetic study of MMF in patients treated for systemic lupus erythematosus, found a high interindividual variability of MPA AUC levels.

The variations in pharmacokinetics of MPA/MPS and the factors causing these differences have been studied in transplant recipients but are not well documented in those with LN. The primary objective of this study is to examine whether exposure controlled MPS dosing results in higher proportion of participants achieving targets of MPA exposure compared with standard empiric dosing in participants with LN. Secondary objectives include the efficacy of exposure-controlled MPS dosing in LN with TDM, the relationship between the disease activity of LN and MPA blood concentrations (pharmacodynamics), and using the data to develop dosing recommendations for MPS in LN. Defining the optimal therapeutic range for MPA is likely to help improve outcomes in participants with LN treated with MPS. The consequences of failure of immunosuppression in LN can be severe and can lead to end-stage renal failure. By personalising MPS dosing for participants with LN using TDM, it may be possible to maximise therapeutic efficacy while preventing significant complications, therapeutic failure and toxicity.</p></sec><sec id="s6"><title>Current status of the study</title><p>The study has started and is in its early stages.
