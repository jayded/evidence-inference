In this prospective high altitude study, we aimed to gain new insights into the pathophysiology of HAR and explored whether HAR could be a valid early indicator of altitude illness.</p></sec><sec><title>Methodology/Principal Findings</title><p>28 mountaineers were randomly assigned to two ascent profiles during a research expedition to Mt. Muztagh Ata (7546 m/24,751 ft). Digital fundus photographs were taken prior to expedition at 490 m (1,607 ft), during expedition at 4497 m (14,750 ft&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;base camp), 5533 m (18,148 ft), 6265 m (20,549 ft), 6865 m (22,517 ft) and 4.5 months thereafter at 490 m. Number, size and time of occurrence of hemorrhages were recorded. Oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub>) and hematocrit were also assessed. 79&#x00025; of all climbers exhibited retinal hemorrhages during the expedition. Number and area of retinal bleeding increased moderately to medium altitudes (6265 m). Most retinal hemorrhages were detected after return to base camp from a high altitude. No post-expeditional ophthalmic sequelae were detected. Significant negative (SpO<sub>2</sub> Beta: &#x02212;0.4, p&#x0003c;0.001) and positive (hematocrit Beta: 0.2, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.002, time at altitude Beta: 0.33, p&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.003) correlations with hemorrhages were found.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions/Significance</title><p>When closely examined, a very large amount of climbers exhibit retinal hemorrhages during exposure to high altitudes. The incidence of retinal hemorrhages may be greater than previously appreciated as a definite time lag was observed between highest altitude reached and development of retinal bleeding. Retinal hemorrhages should not be considered warning signs of impending severe altitude illness due to their delayed appearance.</p></sec></abstract><counts><page-count count="7"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Altitude-related illness, which includes acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude cerebral edema (HACE) and high altitude retinopathy (HAR)<xref rid="pone.0011532-Singh1" ref-type="bibr">[1]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011532-Frayser1" ref-type="bibr">[2]</xref>, occurs in unacclimatized individuals exposed to hypobaric hypoxia at high altitudes.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Hackett1" ref-type="bibr">[3]</xref> Independent risk factors for the development of high altitude illness are the altitude reached, individual susceptibility and rate of ascent.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Schneider1" ref-type="bibr">[4]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011532-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref> Climbers affected by AMS suffer from a variety of nonspecific symptoms such as headache, nausea, insomnia, dizziness, lassitude or fatigue.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Roach1" ref-type="bibr">[6]</xref> In some mountaineers symptoms can progress and develop into HACE, the end-stage of AMS, which is probably due to hypoxia-induced increase in cerebral blood flow coupled with decreased integrity of the blood-brain barrier and cytotoxic edema.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Wilson1" ref-type="bibr">[7]</xref> It is diagnosed by detection of ataxia, altered consciousness or both in a person with AMS.

The overall aim of this prospective large scale study was to assess hypoxic changes of the body in a holistic approach. Our goal in this study was to gain new insights in the pathophysiology of HAR by obtaining frequent field fundus photographs and correlate potential ocular fundus abnormalities with concomitant ocular changes as well as high altitude-associated cerebral symptoms and signs. Finally, we explored whether HAR could be a valid early indicator of altitude illness or even HACE.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="s2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Study design and outcomes</title><p>In this prospective, multidisciplinary study<xref rid="pone.0011532-Bloch1" ref-type="bibr">[5]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011532-Bosch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011532-Bosch2" ref-type="bibr">[16]</xref> 32 mountaineers were randomly assigned to two ascent profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011532-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) during an expedition to Mt.

At every examination, 12 photographs were taken of each eye according to a standardized protocol, where the macula and the entire periphery were documented in a clockwise manner at half-minute intervals. Number, size (in optic disc areas), distance from center of optic disc (in optic disc diameters) to center of hemorrhage, and altitude at which hemorrhages occurred were assessed by two independent ophthalmologists. The custom made program employed to measure size and distance of retinal hemorrhages was developed in MATLAB (R2007a, The MathWorks Inc., Natick MA; U.S.A.), and accounted for different magnification between the cameras and image distortion due to different angles while taking images of the fundus periphery.

Twenty-six climbers reached 6850 m and two (both from group 1) 6250 m as the maximum height during the expedition; 17 mountaineers (9 in group 1 (Gr1), 8 in group 2 (Gr2)) reached the summit. Due to bad weather conditions, Gr1 had to descend from C2 to BC instead of the designated further ascent to C3. Hence, BC2 examinations in Gr1 were performed after the descent from C2 and due to lack of manpower only group 2 (Gr2) could be documented at C3 and BC2 at the end of the expedition. There is no statistically significant difference between groups 1 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;13) and 2 (n&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;15) concerning age ([mean&#x000b1;SD]: 45&#x000b1;12 and 44&#x000b1;8, respectively) and gender (female:male: 2&#x02236;11 and 4&#x02236;11, respectively).</p><p>Of 28 mountaineers, 22 (79&#x00025;) exhibited retinal hemorrhages in at least one eye during the expedition.

In both groups the majority of hemorrhages (number and area) were detected after descent to base camp. The total number of hemorrhages increased by 288&#x00025; (Gr1) and 175&#x00025; (Gr2) upon descent to BC2, whereas the total bleeding area increased by 480&#x00025; (Gr1) and 130&#x00025; (Gr2). The mean distance from the center of the optic disc to the center of the hemorrhage was 1.5&#x000b1;0.8 disc diameters in all climbers; no statistically significant differences were detected between groups and altitudes.

Our novel findings are important since they indicate that retinal hemorrhages cannot be considered as warning signs of severe altitude sickness. Furthermore, the data suggest that the incidence of retinal hemorrhages may have been underestimated in previous studies.</p><p>Our climbers with very low oxygen saturation showed more retinal bleeding throughout the expedition. Also, the higher the ascent and the longer the duration at high altitudes, the higher was the occurrence of retinal hemorrhages. This concurs with a study by McFadden et al. revealing that subjects who developed HAR during maximal exercise showed a lower SaO<sub>2</sub> during exercise than those who did not present with HAR at any time at high altitude.<xref rid="pone.0011532-McFadden1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> If the occurrence of retinal hemorrhages were an immediate effect of the ascent (i.e., increasing hypoxia), many more hemorrhages should have been detected during the ascent (e.g. in group 2 from C2 to C3) as opposed to the surprising increase in hemorrhages observed upon descent. Group 1 (Gr1) exhibited fewer hemorrhages than group 2 (Gr2), possibly due to the fact that Gr1 had final examinations at BC2 after a lower maximal altitude (C2) as compared to Gr2, in which the BC2 examinations were performed after the descent from C3. Our hypothesis stating a correlation between the degree of hypoxia and the number of hemorrhages is supported by the results of the statistical analyses, including our multiple regression analysis. The results strongly suggest a correlation between the degree of hypoxia - severity and time of exposure - and the number of hemorrhages: many more climbers in Gr2 (93&#x00025;) - who had had sustained longer and more extensive systemic hypoxia- showed retinal hemorrhages at BC2 than in Gr1 (62&#x00025;).</p><p>Independent of the amount of hypoxia, the time of occurrence of retinal bleeding is delayed in relation to the ascent for both groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone-0011532-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Hypoxic damage to vascular endothelium and delayed leakage of blood may be the reason for this phenomenon. This is also the common explanation for the occurrence of white-centered hemorrhages, which were detected in 9 of our climbers.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Ling1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> These hemorrhages, also known as Roth spots<xref rid="pone.0011532-Roth1" ref-type="bibr">[23]</xref> can be found in patients with capillary fragility due to conditions such as systemic infections, sepsis, bacterial endocarditis or anemia. The common underlying etiology seems to be the result of capillary rupture.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Ling1" ref-type="bibr">[22]</xref> The white center within the area of bleeding of a Roth spot has been shown histopathologically to represent a fibrin-platelet thrombus. Duane et al. concluded that this white thrombus is at the site of a vessel rupture.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Duane1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> Duane et al.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Duane1" ref-type="bibr">[24]</xref> and McFadden et al.<xref rid="pone.0011532-McFadden1" ref-type="bibr">[8]</xref> described the occurrence of Roth spots at high altitudes. In our study mountaineers with Roth spots had significantly lower SpO<sub>2</sub> values. This supports the possible etiology of retinal bleeding after a hypoxic insult to the retinal vessels at high altitudes, which may cause a wall rupture after a certain time lag.</p><p>Climbers with white-centered hemorrhages also had a larger area of retinal bleeding than the others. Mountaineers with only few and small hemorrhages either had no biomicroscopically detectable thrombi or no vessel rupture. This observation may be explained by a distinct pathophysiological process. Reperfusion trauma occurring upon descent to a lower camp may contribute to endothelial damage; induce diathesis and thereafter visible hemorrhages. Hypoxia leads to the production of oxygen free radicals via the activation of neutrophils,<xref rid="pone.0011532-Freischlag1" ref-type="bibr">[25]</xref> such as in ischaemia-reperfusion trauma. These radicals are harmful to the endothelium and increase vascular permeability.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Gryglewski1" ref-type="bibr">[26]</xref> Loss of vasomotor control may further contribute to the damage of the retinal vessels.<xref rid="pone.0011532-VanOsta1" ref-type="bibr">[27]</xref> Although these pathophysiological changes were studied in conditions with extensive ischaemia (e.g. surgical procedures), we suggest that due to the exceptionally low oxygen saturation during the climb, this process, even though less pronounced than in total ischaemia, may explain the enhanced occurrence of hemorrhages after descent. The extent of hypoxia during a high altitude climb may determine the morphology of HAR.</p><p>Drug intake was shown to have no impact on retinal bleeding in our study. However, only small amounts of different medications were taken by our climbers, which might not have been enough to relevantly influence our analysis.</p><p>HAR is most probably the result of systemic hypoxic effects on the eye despite regulatory attempts by the retinal and choroidal circulation. According to our statistical analysis, parameters characterizing ocular circulation, such as retinal and choroidal blood flow and retinal arterial or venous calibers did not play a valid explanatory role for retinal bleeding during a high altitude expedition.</p><p>According to our analysis, higher hematocrit, possibly representing higher blood viscosity, correlated positively with the number of hemorrhages. Elevated blood viscosity may increase shear stress to the predamaged retinal vascular endothelial cells.</p><p>High altitude retinopathy and its possible etiologies have been described by many authors <xref rid="pone.0011532-Frayser2" ref-type="bibr">[28]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011532-Rennie1" ref-type="bibr">[29]</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0011532-Shults1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref>. A classification for HAR has been established by Wiedman et al.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Wiedman1" ref-type="bibr">[12]</xref>
</p><p>Although optic disc swelling, which occurred in both groups with ascent to higher altitudes and regressed upon descent, was shown to correlate with total area of hemorrhages during the expedition, the course of these parameters differed at BC2 where almost all optic disc swelling had regressed.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Bosch1" ref-type="bibr">[15]</xref> Both optic disc swelling and HAR are signs of overall susceptibility to hypoxia. Nevertheless, since reaction of the optic disc to hypoxia is quicker than that of potential retinal hemorrhages, a grading of HAR implying a direct correlation with cerebral attenuation is not warranted. Such a grading of HAR should primarily include optic disc swelling rather than number and area of hemorrhages. Singling out climbers with HACE, no difference in number or area of hemorrhages in comparison to the mountaineers without HACE was detected. This is another indicator that HAR has no prognostic value for cerebral attenuation during a high altitude expedition.</p><p>Many reports on high altitude climbing show persistence of symptoms such as scotomas<xref rid="pone.0011532-Shults1" ref-type="bibr">[30]</xref> and visual field shrinkage.<xref rid="pone.0011532-Wiedman2" ref-type="bibr">[31]</xref> We found no such sequelae in our climbers 4.5 months after the expedition, nor any signs of visual disturbances during the expedition except for the climber with vitreous hemorrhages in one eye. This may be attributed to the observation that the vast majority of retinal hemorrhages occurred near the optic disc hardly affecting the macula.</p><p>Despite the impressive number of ocular changes at high altitudes, it seems that they are mostly transient. We suggest that the number of retinal hemorrhages rather than the total area of bleeding is a delayed marker of overall degree of hypoxic exposure. Also, due to latency of their appearance, retinal hemorrhages should not be considered warning signs of impending severe AMS or HACE. Based on our data, we cannot confirm that the current classification of HAR can be used as a predictor of progressive altitude illness.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>We would like to thank our hematology group with Andreas Huber, MD, for their significant efforts concerning hematocrit measurements, Alexander Turk, MD, Otto Schoch, MD, Thomas Hess, MD, and Gregor Schubiger, MD, for their unwavering support during the expedition.

Thus this does not alter the authors' adherence to all the PLoS ONE policies on sharing data and materials.</p></fn><fn fn-type="financial-disclosure"><p><bold>Funding: </bold>This project was supported by a research grant from the Swiss National Research Science Foundation (Grant No. EK 11 1146), a research grant by the Swiss Society of Mountain Medicine, a private grant to the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Zurich, and by an unconditional grant from Pfizer, Switzerland. These grants were utilized for logistics during the expedition, acquisition of material and research devices. The funders had no role in study design, data collection and analysis, decision to publish, or preparation of the manuscript.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0011532-Singh1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
