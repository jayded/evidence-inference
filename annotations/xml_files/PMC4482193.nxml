Previous data from our laboratory proved a supportive role for stem cell therapy in the treatment of end-stage liver disease patients. Therefore; this study was conducted to assess the clinical and biochemical effects of repeated stem cell infusion.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Ninety patients with liver cirrhosis were randomized to receive either one session treatment (G-I) or two sessions 4&#x000a0;months apart (G-II) of autologous haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) transplantation and a control group (G-III) who received regular liver treatment. G-CSF was administered to transplanted patients before infusion; HSCs were isolated from 400&#x000a0;cc bone marrow (BM) aspirate. CD34+/CD133+ cells were purified: 50&#x000a0;% of the cells were infused locally in the portal vein on the same day and the other 50&#x000a0;% were differentiated to MSC and infused systemically in a peripheral vein (one session treatment G-I). In G-II, the same process was repeated after 4&#x000a0;months from the first treatment (two session&#x02019;s treatment G-II). Liver function was monitored for 12&#x000a0;months after stem cell therapy (SCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>Statistically significant improvement was reported in the transplanted patients (G-1) as regards the mean serum albumin, bilirubin and INR levels which started to improve after 2&#x000a0;weeks of treatment and continued to improve till the 6<sup>th</sup> month in the single infusion group. The two sessions infused group (G-II) showed sustained response which continued throughout the all follow-up period (12&#x000a0;month). By the end of the study, 36.7&#x000a0;% of the patients in G-I and 66.7&#x000a0;% in G-II showed improvement in the degree of ascites compared to the control group (G-III). We also reported an improvement in the hepatic functional reserve as assessed by the Child-Pugh and MELD score. Safety of the procedure was evidenced by the low incidence of complications encountered.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In patients with end-stage liver disease, the repeated infusion with combined routes portal and peripheral veins has a beneficial effect on liver functions with minimal adverse events and more lasting clinical efficacy after repeated HSCs infusion.</p></sec></abstract><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2015</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1" sec-type="introduction"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cirrhosis, the end result of long-term liver damage, and its related morbidity place a significant burden on health care worldwide. Liver transplantation is the only definitive therapeutic option for these patients. However, the paucity of donors, rejection and the high costs are hindering factors. Cell-based regenerative therapies, particularly the adult haematopoietic stem cell (HSC)-based therapies, are evolving as viable clinical alternatives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>].</p><p>Stem cells are clonogenic, self-renewing cells, capable of differentiating into multiple cell lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. During tissue injury, bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) are mobilized and migrate to the injured organ. This has formed the basis for regenerative therapy whereby treatment with appropriate stem cells might ameliorate specific diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>].</p><p>The observation that hepatocytes could be derived from bone marrow (BM) cell populations, and further advances in the understanding of HSC plasticity, have formed the basis for stem cell therapy in patients with liver disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, the mechanism by which HSCs contribute to liver repair is controversial. Initial studies suggested that adult stem cell plasticity and their differentiation to hepatocytes is a possible mechanism of action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Other studies have shown that conversion to hepatocytes may occur via cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Animal studies demonstrate that infusion of BM during liver injury reduces the amount of liver scarring, owing to matrix metalloproteinase-9 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Recently, the concept of stem cell infusions exerting a paracrine proliferative effect on endogenous hepatocytes has been gaining support, backed up by rodent and human studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>In Egypt, results obtained from several studies suggested that autologous CD34<sup>+</sup> cell transplantation offered considerable improvement in the quality of life and liver functions in patients with viral or non-viral causes of end-stage liver disease with no procedure-related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. However, it was observed that serum albumin, bilirubin and International Normalized Ratio (INR) levels had gradually worsened towards pre-infusion levels after an initial improvement for about 3&#x02013;6 months, especially in patients with viral aetiologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p><p>The inability to maintain the initial improvement in those patients could be attributed, at least potentially, to the ongoing disease processes affecting the regenerated hepatocytes over a longer period. Therefore, in order to maintain benefit of such therapies, it may be important to treat the causative disease, such as viral hepatitis, to make the infused cells resistant to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or to repeat the injection of stem cells at intervals to achieve significant and lasting clinical results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>Currently, there are no published trials regarding the beneficial effect of repeated infusion of HSCs in liver disease. However, repeated infusion of BM cells in patients with large acute myocardial infarction resulted in a significant increase in left ventricular ejection fraction and a decrease in myocardial infarct size compared with single intracoronary injection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Studied groups</title><p>This prospective study included 90 patients with hepatitis C virus (HCV)-associated liver cirrhosis who were eligible for treatment intervention.

The skin, subcutaneous tissues and periosteum overlying the selected site for puncture were infiltrated with xylocaine local anaesthesia and serial punctures from multiple sites were performed.

Pegylated interferon was not used in the current study, since most of our cases were Child&#x02013;Pugh score C where interferon has a limited effect with many side effects. On the other hand, the second generation (sofosbuvier, semiprivir) is not yet available in Egypt. Patients were therefore maintained on suppressive therapy using ribavirin and amantadine.</p><p>Liver cirrhosis represents the end result of chronic liver disease and is a major cause of mortality worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. In Egypt, HCV-associated liver disease is a national health problem causing considerable morbidity and mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p><p>Liver transplantation is the only curative treatment for decompensated cirrhosis, but it is limited by technical difficulties, high cost and lack of donors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Other treatment modalities for decompensated cirrhosis are only symptomatic with transient improvement of the quality of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. Consequently, the majority of untransplanted patients die while waiting for transplantation. Therefore, it is necessary to develop new therapeutic modalities for patients with chronic liver disease.</p><p>Cell-based therapy, including stem cell therapy, offers considerable hope for these patients since the stem cells, including BM-derived stem cells, have the capacity for self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Transplantation of BMSCs can therefore restore liver mass and function, alleviate fibrosis and correct inherited diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In addition, patients receiving autologous BMSCs demonstrated considerable improvement in their laboratory data and quality of life, with no procedure-related complications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. However, the inability to maintain the initial response could be due to the ongoing disease process which affects the regenerated hepatocytes over a long period. Therefore, in order to maintain the effect of such therapies, it may be important to treat the causative liver disease, such as viral hepatitis, to make the infused cells resistant to viral infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>] or to repeat the injection of stem cells at intervals to achieve sustained response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>] as previously reported in patients with large acute myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].</p><p>We therefore sought to assess the effectiveness of HSC transplantation when given through two different routes in combination (peripherally and intra-portal vein) or sequentially (4&#x000a0;months apart) compared with the single-infusion procedure.</p><p>We found a statistically significant difference between the single-infusion and the repeated-infusion groups regarding serum albumin throughout the follow-up period.

By the end of the study, 40&#x000a0;% of the patients showed improvement in the degree of ascites, 60&#x000a0;% showed no change and none of the studied patients showed deterioration in their degree of ascites. Our findings in this context support previously published data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>During the follow-up period in the current study, 11 patients suffered attacks of haematemesis, which occurred after 6&#x000a0;months of the stem cell transplantation: four patients (13.3&#x000a0;%) from G-I, two patients (6.7&#x000a0;%) from G-II and five patients from the control group. Two patients were Child&#x02013;Pugh score B and nine patients were Child&#x02013;Pugh score C; two of which died from uncontrolled bleeding that occurred at the 12th month. Literature review showed that transient portal hypertension resulting from blood flow occlusion following stem cell infusion usually resolves in 2&#x02013;3 hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. At the beginning of the current study, there was no PVT in the studied groups. After 12&#x000a0;months of the study, the incidence of PVT was 3.3&#x000a0;% (one patient) in G-I compared with 6.7&#x000a0;% (two patients) in the control group. Further investigations for this patient by triphasic CT scan showed no hepatic focal lesions and an AFP level of 19&#x000a0;ng/ml. Patients in G-II (repeated infusion) showed no incidence of PVT throughout the follow-up period.</p><p>Although some studies in the literature have mentioned a possible carcinogenic effect of BMSC infusion in patients with chronic liver diseases, especially if in vitro pre-expanded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>], our data showed that after 12&#x000a0;months of follow-up by ultrasonography and s-AFP only one patient (3.3&#x000a0;%) in G-I (single infusion) and none in G-II (repeated infusion) were diagnosed with HCC compared with two patients (6.7&#x000a0;%) in the control group. Our results are comparable with those of Levicar et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>], who showed absence of any focal lesions in five patients treated by stem cell therapy who were followed-up by CT scan and serum AFP for 18&#x000a0;months, indicating that the stem cell product used was safe in the short term and over the long term, by absence of tumour formation. Our results suggest that combined application of HSCs by infusion into the portal vein and the peripheral veins bears the potential for augmenting liver regeneration in the clinical setting and can be used in the treatment of decompensated liver cirrhosis.</p><p>The HSCs can be delivered via different routes; each of which has its own advantages and disadvantages. The ideal strategy for stem cell delivery is that it should be easy to perform, minimally invasive, has very little side effects, has high cell survival and should be based on clinical settings. Moreover, under certain circumstances, the combination of more than one method may be considered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>].</p><p>Two recently published meta-analyses have confirmed our previous and current data regarding the beneficial effect of stem cell therapy for end-stage liver disease patients and show almost the same results as ours. However, our current study is a step ahead of any previous published data by using a double stem cell infusion technique to extend the beneficial effect for more than 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, the current study is the first trial investigating a second session of HSC infusion in Egyptian patients with HCV-related liver cell failure. Our results provide evidence for the first time that two infusions with HSC result in more sustained improvement in liver functions and quality of life during 12-months follow-up than a single infusion.</p><p>A point of criticism for the current study could be the lack of a control group of patients who received G-CSF alone, especially in the presence of several studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of G-CSF alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. One reason for not using G-CSF alone in the current study is that we have previously shown that the content of stem cells in end-stage liver disease patients is usually very low (1&#x02013;3&#x000a0;% only). This amount is not sufficient for stem cell treatment in those patients and does not induce much improvement at the clinical and/or biochemical levels. However, with G-CSF the stem cell content increased to about 50&#x02013;75&#x000a0;%, which provided the proper amount required for stem cell transplantation and differentiation even after purification of CD133<sup>+</sup> and CD34<sup>+</sup> cells. In addition, the main aim of the current study was to assess the beneficial effect (clinical and biochemical) of repeated MSC infusion, administered 4&#x000a0;months apart, as compared with single infusion and a control group.</p></sec><sec id="Sec12" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Repeated HSC infusions give more sustained clinical efficacy and improvement in liver functions and quality of life during 12-month follow-up compared with single HSC infusion. Accordingly, stem cell therapy could be a promising therapeutic modality in patients with end-stage liver disease, which may replace or decrease the need for whole organ transplantation in the future, especially if gene manipulation of the stem cells makes them able to resist viral infection or HCC development.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>AFP</term><def><p>&#x003b1;-fetoprotein</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>ALT</term><def><p>Alanine transaminase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>AST</term><def><p>Aspartate transaminase</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BM</term><def><p>Bone marrow</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>BMSC</term><def><p>Bone marrow stem cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>CT</term><def><p>Computed tomography</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>G-CSF</term><def><p>Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBcAb</term><def><p>Hepatitis B core antibody</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HBsAg</term><def><p>Hepatitis B surface antigen</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCC</term><def><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HCV</term><def><p>Hepatitis C virus</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HRS</term><def><p>Hepatorenal syndrome</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HSC</term><def><p>Haematopoietic stem cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>INR</term><def><p>International Normalized Ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MELD</term><def><p>Model for End-Stage Liver Disease</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>MSC</term><def><p>Mesenchymal stem cell</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PVT</term><def><p>portal vein thrombosis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SBP</term><def><p>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>WHO</term><def><p>World Health Organization</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>A-RNZ generated the idea and was responsible for the stem cell separation and differentiation, data analysis, and editing and revising the manuscript.
