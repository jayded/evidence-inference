A nephrostomy tube is placed to drain urine and blood clots, allow reentry for retrieval of residual calculi, and provide tamponade. Pain around the nephrostomy tube may be agonizing and requires analgesia. Post-operative pain management relies on pharmacological agents like opioids and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs with their associated adverse effects, particularly in patients with potential renal complications.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] Regional techniques offer many advantages: Pain is cured at its origin, close to the damaged tissue area, and when local anesthetics are used, they provide analgesia without opioid-like side-effects. We have reported peritubal infiltration of the nephrostomy tract from the skin to the renal capsule with local anesthetic that alleviated post-operative pain for 14 h with reduced analgesic load.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Opioids, when used as an adjuvant to local anesthetics, is known to enhance analgesia. Peripheral opioid receptors that are present along the peripheral sensory nerves, especially after the painful inflammatory conditions, form the basis for peripheral opioid analgesia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Buprenorphine, a semisynthetic opioid, has shown to prolong the duration of analgesia when used as an adjuvant in brachial plexus blocks, Biers block and central neuraxial blocks and intraoral nerve blocks.[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref><xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] There is scant literature on its use in peritubal block. We hypothesized that addition of buprenorphine to local anesthetic prolongs the duration of analgesia in peritubal infiltration. The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether addition of buprenorphine to 0.25% bupivacaine enhances the duration of analgesia in peritubal infiltration following PCNL.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>Forty American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade I and II patients were recruited for this prospective, randomized controlled study after obtaining Institutional Ethics Committee approval and informed consent from the patients. The patients enrolled were aged between 18 and 60 years, weighing 40&#x02013;80 kg and belonging to either gender. All patients received standard general anesthesia with fentanyl 2 &#x003bc;g/kg as analgesic. PCNL was performed with single subcostal nephrostomy tract and a nephrostomy tube (size 14/16 F) was placed at the end of the procedure. The average stone size was 2.5 cm (1.8&#x02013;3.2 cm). The patients were randomized into two groups based on computer-generated random numbers. Group I (n = 21) patients received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and group II (n = 19) patients received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 100 &#x003bc;g of buprenorphine. Exclusion criteria were patients with age more than 60 years, body mass index &#x0003e; 30, renal stones requiring more than a single puncture, surgical procedure extending more than 3 h, excess bleeding, delayed recovery or requiring post-operative ventilation, incomplete data and patient withdrawal from the study. A standard PCNL was performed and, at the end of the procedure, group I patients received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine and group II patients received 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 100 &#x003bc;g buprenorphine peritubally. Under fluoroscopic guidance, a 23 G spinal needle was introduced along the nephrostomy tube at the 12 O&#x02019; clock position till it reached the renal capsule, after which the needle was slowly withdrawn by injecting the study drug along the tissue planes, i.e. the renal capsule, muscles, subcutaneous tissue and the skin. The same procedure was repeated at the 6 O&#x02019; clock position. The patient's trachea was extubated once the extubation criteria were fulfilled by reversing the residual neuromuscular blockade. Post-operative pain was assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) and dynamic VAS (pain on deep breath and cough - D VAS), a 10-point scale ranging from 0 &#x02013; minimum or no pain to 10 &#x02013; the maximum pain score perceived by the patient, by an independent observer blinded to the study, every 4<sup>th</sup> hour for 24 h from the time of extubation. The duration of block was taken from the time the study drug was administered peritubally to the time for first demand of analgesia. Rescue analgesia was provided by inj tramadol 1 mg/kg IV if pain score was 3 or &#x0003e; 3 on VAS. Wilson's Sedation score ranging from 1 to 5 (fully awake to full sedation <xref ref-type="app" rid="APP1">Appendix 1</xref>), duration of analgesia and number of rescue analgesic demands were also noted at four-hourly intervals.</p><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was performed using Minitab-14<sup>&#x000ae;</sup>. Descriptive data were expressed as median values with interquartile range (IQR) for continuous and ordered categorical variables. Comparison of continuous data and ordered categorical variables was performed between the groups using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test and comparison of discrete variables between groups was performed using the Chi-square test. To obtain a composite value for the pain score distributed over a period of 24 h, an area under curve (AUC) for the pain score of each patient was determined for VAS and DVAS. AUC was compared between the two groups using the Mann&#x02013;Whitney U-test as the sample size was small. A <italic>P</italic> value of &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered as being significant</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><p>All 40 patients enrolled for the study were analyzed.

Using a difference of 5.81 h in the analgesia duration between the study and control groups, and using a pooled standard deviation of 4.72 h, the power of this study was 0.998 and 0.8738 for alpha values of 0.05 and 0.01, respectively.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion" id="sec1-4"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The main finding of this prospective study was that addition of 100 &#x003bc;g buprenorphine to 0.25% bupivacaine in peritubal block prolonged the duration of analgesia. The median duration of analgesia was 16 (12&#x02013;16) h in group I and 20 (16&#x02013;24) h in group II (<italic>P</italic> = 0.002), which was statistically significant. This finding is consistent with our previous study in which peritubal infiltration of the nephrostomy track provided effective post-operative analgesia for 14 h.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>] Addition of buprenorphine to bupivacaine has prolonged the analgesic duration both statistically and clinically. Candido and coauthors[<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>] used 300 &#x003bc;g of buprenorphine with local anesthetic for brachial plexus block and found post-operative analgesia for 17.5 &#x000b1; 1.26 h (control 5.3 &#x000b1; 0.15 h) that was statistically and clinically significant (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.0001). In our study, the duration of analgesia was 20 h. This difference in the duration of analgesia may be because of the type of surgical procedures that the patients had undergone. In another study,[<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] 300 &#x003bc;g of buprenorphine was added to local anesthetic (1% mepivacaine and 0.2% tetracaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine) in the axillary approach of brachial plexus block, and the mean duration of analgesia was found to be 22.3 h, which is slightly higher than that in the present study. This may probably be because of the addition of epinephrine to the local anesthetic and also to the usage of a high dose of buprenorphine. Capogna and coworkers[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] in their study of intrathecal buprenorphine for suprapuic prostatectomy in elderly patients reported post-operative analgesia persisting more than 7 h. Similar results were reported when buprenorphine was used in intraoral nerve blocks for minor dental procedures in outpatient procedures.[<xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] Addition of buprenorphine not only prolonged the duration but also the quality of analgesia because the time to achieve max VAS was 7 h in group II and 5 h in group I. The pain scores, both VAS and DVAS, were low in both the groups; however, the number of analgesic demands and total analgesic consumed in group II was significantly low (<italic>P</italic> = 0.007). The AUC that represents the composite value for VAS and DVAS pain scores distributed over a period of 24 h was significantly low in group II, 9, than in group I (<italic>P</italic> = 0.047 and 0.017), respectively.</p><p>An increasing number of studies recently reported the existence of opioid receptors outside the central nervous system, and the demonstration that opioid receptors exist in the peripheral nervous system offers the possibility of providing post-operative analgesia[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref><xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>] Opioids when administered peripherally act on peripheral opioid receptors without central action and eliminate unwanted central side-effects, mainly like respiratory and cardiac depression, sedation and pruiritus. Sedation score was not statistically or clinically significant in the present study.</p><p>Buprenorphine is a synthetic partial &#x003bc;-receptor agonist derived from thebain, one of the opioid alkaloids.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] It was chosen because of its physicochemical properties like rapid onset and prolonged duration of action, high lipid solubility, potency (33 times more potent than morphine) and high affinity for &#x003bc; receptors than morphine, long half-life (mean 30 h), a low abuse potential and ceiling effect for respiratory depression. Therefore, it can safely be used and, in case of any side-effects, inj naloxone (0.01&#x02013;0.1 mg/kg SC) can be used to reverse the cardiac or respiratory depression. Local analgesic techniques are of increasing interest in the recent years because they are simple and safe and provide effective analgesia without any adverse effects; they are more suitable in patients with potential compromised renal functions. Peritubal block provided effective post-operative analgesia, and addition of buprenorphine further added the duration of analgesia.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSION</title><p>Peritubal infiltration of 0.25% bupivacaine with 100 &#x003bc;g buprenorphine is a simple and safe method that has significantly increased the duration of analgesia without any adverse effects and with reduced requirement of analgesics.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="supported-by"><p><bold>Source of Support:</bold> Nil</p></fn><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold>Conflict of Interest:</bold> None declared.</p></fn></fn-group><app-group><app id="APP1"><title>ANNEXURE I</title><p><bold>The Wilson Sedation Score</bold></p><p>
