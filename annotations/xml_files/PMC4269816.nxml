A combination of these agents can provide greater efficacy for patients who remain symptomatic on LABA or LAMA monotherapy, and a number of studies have demonstrated a superior bronchodilation effect with combined LABA and LAMA compared with the individual agents alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>GSK961081 is a novel bi-functional molecule (or dual pharmacophore) that combines muscarinic antagonism (MA) and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonism (BA) in a single molecule (MABA). Pre-clinical data showed GSK961081 to be a potent functional antagonist of muscarinic receptors, as well as a potent, selective, and full agonist at the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor, which produced significant and sustained bronchoprotection that was significantly greater than that with either of the MA or BA components alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Clinically, GSK961081 at 400 and 1,200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once daily for 2&#x000a0;weeks demonstrated sustained bronchodilation similar to a combination of tiotropium 18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once daily plus salmeterol 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g twice daily but with a more rapid onset of action in patients with moderate COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Additionally, a dose of 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g once a day for 28&#x000a0;days resulted in a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV<sub>1</sub>) of 215 (139&#x02013;291 at 95&#x000a0;% confidence interval)&#x000a0;mL greater than placebo in patients with moderate and severe COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. It may be necessary to understand the relative contribution of the &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist versus anti-muscarinic components of such a molecule in humans. One way to do that is to block one of the components. Bronchodilation following inhaled &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist and anti-muscarinic agents can be measured by specific airway conductance (sGaw) in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Inhibition of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist-mediated bronchodilation (as measured by sGaw) in healthy volunteers by the non-selective &#x003b2;-blocker propranolol has been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. However, published studies have generally looked at the effect of a single dose of propranolol on a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist over a relatively short (a few hours) period of time, have been small, and have used various doses of propranolol and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist with various degrees of inhibition of bronchodilation. Propranolol alone does not affect sGaw in healthy volunteers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. However, there were no published data on the effects of &#x003b2; blockade on sGaw following an inhaled anti-muscarinic alone or the combination of inhaled &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist and anti-muscarinic.</p><p>We therefore conducted and report two studies. Study 1 was conducted to confirm a dosing regimen of the &#x003b2; antagonist propranolol, which prevents the increase in sGaw to a &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist over 24&#x000a0;h and had acceptable tolerability. It was also to confirm that the &#x003b2; antagonist propranolol did not prevent an increase in sGaw in response to an anti-muscarinic and also to characterize the effect on sGaw of a combination of an anti-muscarinic and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist and the effect of propranolol on the combination. Study 2 reports bronchodilation following the administration of GSK961081 in healthy volunteers in the presence and absence of propranolol.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Subjects</title><p>Healthy adult male or female (study 1 only, as reproductive toxicology had not been completed for GSK961081 at the time of study) subjects aged 18&#x02013;50&#x000a0;years inclusive with a body mass index (BMI) within the range 19&#x02013;29.9&#x000a0;kg/m<sup>2</sup> were included.

The most frequently reported AEs were dysgeusia (24 reports), dizziness (seven reports), and headache (six reports). All AEs were rated as being mild or moderate in intensity, and no serious AEs were reported. One subject (GSK961081 1,200 &#x000b5;g + propranolol) had a PR interval of 224 at 6&#x000a0;h after the first dose of propranolol and therefore did not have further doses of propranolol. The efficacy data for this subject were not included in the analysis for this treatment. There were no clinically important findings in other safety assessments. Potassium and glucose data were similar at all time points (pre-dose, 1, 4, and 24&#x000a0;h) across all treatments, including placebo.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec25" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In study 1, inhalation of salbutamol 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g (+ placebo) resulted in the expected bronchodilation. At the final time point for sGaw assessment, 6&#x000a0;h after the last dose of salbutamol, there was no increase in sGaw. This is because the final sGaw measurement was taken too long after the last salbutamol dose. Our data are consistent with published data showing that sGaw 6&#x000a0;h after salbutamol is the same as after placebo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. The propranolol regimen used prevented the increase in sGaw in response to salbutamol 600&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g, but did not prevent the sGaw response to ipratropium 40&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g. Therefore, we have demonstrated a propranolol dosing regimen that was effective in preventing bronchodilation to a supra-therapeutic dose of &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist, but that did not prevent the bronchodilation to a low dose of anti-muscarinic.</p><p>This is the first study where the effect of combined salbutamol and ipratropium on sGaw has been explored in healthy volunteers. Whilst there was a trend to an increase in sGaw when salbutamol was added to ipratropium, this assessment does not appear to be sensitive enough to detect the benefit of the two mechanisms in healthy volunteers. This is in contrast to this endpoint in COPD patients, where a single dose of salmeterol 50 &#x003bc;g (+ fluticasone propionate 500&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g) + tiotropium 18&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g was significantly more effective than tiotropium or salmeterol (+ fluticasone) alone in improving post-dose sGaw [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>In study 2, bronchodilation was seen for 24 h following a single dose of both 400 and 1,200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g GSK961081. In the presence of effective &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> blockade, GSK961081 1,200&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g demonstrated bronchodilation in the first 4&#x000a0;h after dosing but not at 7&#x000a0;h onwards, whilst GSK961081 400&#x000a0;&#x003bc;g demonstrated bronchodilation in the first 1&#x000a0;h after dosing, but not at 4&#x000a0;h onwards. Therefore, in this model, the MA alone bronchodilation is of shorter duration than the bronchodilation achieved with the MA/BA activity combined.</p><p>This assessment may underestimate the MA contribution to the MA/BA activity combined. Amplification of bronchodilation achieved by one component by the other component is believed to contribute to the benefit of combined anti-muscarinic and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> agonist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Investigative studies have suggested that the enhanced MABA activity compared with the single ligands may be due to crosstalk between the engaged M3 and &#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Crosstalk between the receptors could be reduced or abolished by blocking the &#x003b2; receptor as has been done in the reported clinical studies.</p><p>Therefore, removing the BA component completely may underestimate the contribution of the MA component to the bronchodilation of the combination by removing the potential for amplification of one mechanism by the other. In addition, the response in healthy volunteers may not be the same as in COPD patients. In COPD patients, salbutamol and ipratropium have been added at 1, 12, and 24&#x000a0;h following single doses of GSK961081 400 and 1,200&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. In that study, the additional bronchodilation following salbutamol and ipratropium inhalation was similar, and this indirect assessment may indicate that the activities of the MA and BA components are of a similar magnitude. A further limitation is that the study looked at single-dose GSK961081 only; investigating the response after repeat dosing would also be of interest.</p><p>In both studies, all dosing regimens were well tolerated. There were no serious AEs, and all AEs reported were consistent with the known effects of propranolol and salbutamol or the AEs previously reported with GSK961081 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>].</p><p>Pharmacokinetic modeling was used to inform propranolol dose selection for the two studies. The propranolol dosing regimen (five doses of propranolol 80&#x000a0;mg at 6-h intervals) was safe and well tolerated and shown to provide plasma propranolol concentrations above the in vitro predicted EC<sub>90</sub> throughout the treatment session. This propranolol dosing regimen was effective at preventing the increase in sGaw in response to salbutamol 600 &#x003bc;g. However, it is possible that propranolol did not completely block the effects of the BA component of the MABA, and some of the bronchodilation seen following MABA in the presence of propranolol is due to residual BA effect. There was no apparent difference in exposure to propranolol when administered alone or in combination with either salbutamol or ipratropium and salbutamol. GSK961081 systemic exposure (<italic>C</italic><sub>max</sub> and AUC<sub>t</sub>) was increased by approximately 60&#x000a0;% in the presence of propranolol. In vitro data suggest that the difference is unlikely to be a result of metabolic interaction or plasma protein-binding displacement. Propranolol is a cytochrome P450 (CYP)1A2, CYP2D6, and CYP2C19 substrate with a minor route (~15&#x000a0;%) via direct glucuronidation; whereas that of GSK961081 appears to be by direct glucuronidation and a CYP3A4 substrate. A postulated reason for the difference is that GSK961081 apparent clearance is decreased as a result of a decrease in liver blood flow in the presence of propranolol (&#x003b2;<sub>2</sub> adrenoceptor mediated).</p><p>In conclusion, in this healthy volunteer model, the duration of bronchodilation from the MA component alone was of shorter duration than that achieved from the MA/BA combination.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank Maurice Leonard for clinical and operational support, and Chang-Qing Zhu and Nigel Dallow for statistical input.
