The problem of finding suitable surrogate paraclinical markers during AIT is currently very relevant. The aim was to evaluate the allergen-specific IgE/IgG4 ratio as an immunological correlate to clinical efficacy during AIT with House Dust Mite (HDM) allergen vaccines in Cuban asthmatic patients.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Three separate Double-Blind Placebo-Controlled clinical trials of AIT were performed using standardized registered allergen extracts of 3 HDM species: <italic>Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus</italic>, and the tropical species <italic>D. siboney</italic> and <italic>Blomia tropicalis</italic>. Each clinical trial included 40 asthmatic patients, totalling 120 individuals. Half of them received placebo. Allergen-specific IgE and IgG4 antibodies were measured by ELISA. Antibody titres were normalized and averaged between the 3 trials. Size effect was calculated as the Standard Mean Difference (SMD) between the active and placebo groups, using meta-analysis tools.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>There was a significant increase of IgG4 antibodies (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05) after 6 months of treatment. At 12 months, the IgG4 increase was even greater and the IgE decrease achieved also significance (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Thus, IgG4 induction appeared to precede IgE changes, in agreement with the possible role of the Treg/IL-10 response induction at the initial AIT phase. Moreover, 83% of patients showed a decrease of the IgE/IgG4 ratio in the active groups, whereas only 32% showed reduction in placebo groups. The IgE/IgG4 ratio was the immunological variable with the greatest size effect value (SMD = 0.81 95% CI, 0.71-0.91), as compared to changes in IgE or IgG4 levels, alone. The size effect value was close to the clinical effect (symptom-medication score SMD = 1.2 95% CI, 0.7-1.7). Per-patient changes in IgG4 levels, as well as, in the IgE/IgG4 ratio, were significantly correlated to the symptom-medication variable (<italic>r</italic> = 0.23, <italic>P</italic> = 0.04).</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>These results support the use of the IgE/IgG4 ratio as an easily measurable marker for monitoring the allergen-specific immunity during AIT with HDM in asthmatic patients, and possibly, for predicting patient's clinical improvement after 1 year of treatment.</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front></article>
