In modern science, chronic sinusitis can be correlated with <italic>Dushta Pratishyaya</italic> on the basis of the signs, symptoms, complications, and prognosis. Changing lifestyles, rapid urbanization, and the increase in cases of antibiotic resistance are responsible for the rise in the prevalence of sinusitis. In the present clinical study, 37 patients were registered and were randomly divided into three groups: A, B, and C; of the 37 patients, 31 completed the full course of treatment. In group A, <italic>Trayodashanga Kwatha</italic> with <italic>Madhu</italic> was given orally; in group B, <italic>Pradhamana Nasya</italic> with <italic>Trikatu + Triphala Churna</italic> was administered; and in group C (combined group), <italic>Pradhamana Nasya</italic> was administered initially, followed by oral <italic>Trayodashanga Kwatha</italic> with <italic>Madhu</italic>. In group A, complete relief was observed in 10% of the patients; in group B, marked improvement was observed in 81.82% of patients; and in group C, marked relief was observed in 60% of patients.

It can cause many complications, such as <italic>Badhirya, Andhata, Ghrananasha</italic>, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2">2</xref>]</p><p>In general, the features of the disease <italic>Dushta Pratishyaya</italic> are similar to that of chronic sinusitis in modern science. Both these diseases are characterized by nasal blockage, nasal discharge, headache, anosmia, heaviness in the head, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>]</p><p>As the nose is in direct contact with the external environment, it is exposed to the many microorganisms and pollutants present in the atmosphere. Due to the increase in environmental pollution and the busy lifestyles of today, rhinitis is a common disease in the present era.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] Improper management of this stage leads to sinusitis, which may later lead to chronic sinusitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] More than 120 million Indians suffer from at least one episode of sinusitis each year[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref4">4</xref>] and, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology and Head and Neck Surgery, more than 37 million Americans suffer from at least one episode of sinusitis each year.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">5</xref>] Jamnagar is a coastal city with many industries. Due to the air pollution, respiratory infections are common. A large number of patients with sinusitis also report to the ENT &#x02013; <italic>Shalakya</italic>, OPD of IPGT and RA.</p><p>Once the sinuses are infected, improper management and poor dietary habits can lead the disease into a chronic phase.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] This chronic sinusitis is too difficult to drain out completely. It remains as a focus of infection, leading to inflammation in all associated structures, e.g., the tonsils, ear, pharynx, larynx etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">6</xref>] Ultimately, it may lead to complications such as otitis media, orbital cellulitis, osteomylitis, etc.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] In modern medical science, a wide range of antibiotics and decongestants are available for the treatment of sinusitis.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">8</xref>] But these drugs can help only in the initial stage. Once pus collection forms in the sinuses and is not drained spontaneously, only surgical intervention can help.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] After drainage of the sinuses, antibiotics can help. FESS (functional endoscopic sinus surgery), Caldwell-Luc operation, Howarth's operation, etc., are the chief operative procedures to drain the sinus if conservative measures fail.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">3</xref>] These surgical procedures are associated with many complications, including bleeding, oro-antral fistula, infraorbital anaesthesia, neuralgia, and paraesthesia.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">7</xref>] The modern treatment modalities for chronic sinusitis are also expensive and not free from side effects. Also, frequent use of antibiotics leads to the gradual development of drug resistance. Moreover, no drug for treatment of allergy and viral infection is available in the modern science.</p><p>Acharya Sushruta has not clearly mentioned the line of treatment of <italic>Dushta Pratishyaya</italic>.

As <italic>Dushta Pratishyaya</italic> is chronic stage of the <italic>Pratishyaya</italic> and <italic>Kapha Dosha</italic> is predominant in this condition, <italic>Pradhamana Nasya</italic> was selected as the chief <italic>Shodhana</italic> procedure in this study. <italic>Trikatu</italic> + <italic>Triphala Churna</italic> for <italic>Pradhamananasya</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">10</xref>] and <italic>Trayodashanga Kwatha</italic>[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11">11</xref>] were selected.

The <italic>Aharaja Nidanas</italic> are a reflection of the changing and busy lifestyles of today and play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>The data of <italic>Viharaja Nidana</italic> reveals that all the patients showed increase of symptoms in <italic>Ritu Vaishamya</italic> and <italic>Ritu Sandhi</italic>, whereas <italic>Raja Sevana</italic> was found in 78.37% and <italic>Dhuma Sevana</italic> in 72.97% of the patients. Here, <italic>Ritu Vaishamya</italic> and <italic>Ritu Sandhi</italic> are such etiological factors which are very difficult to avoid and <italic>Raja-Dhuma Sevana</italic> are also very difficult to avoid all the time for all persons and these etiological factors are described as <italic>Sadyojanak Nidan</italic> for <italic>Pratishyaya</italic> by <italic>Acharya Sushruta</italic>. These observations reveal that the area of this study is prone to atmospheric pollution. Chronic contact with such unavoidable <italic>Hetus</italic> will nullify the effect of the therapy. This could be the reason why patients were not getting relief even after taking treatment for many years.</p><p><italic>Krodha</italic> as <italic>Manasika Nidana</italic> was observed in the maximum numbers of the patients (67.56%). It is also reflection of the Prakriti of the patients and also today's lifestyles. This also plays major role in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>In <italic>Kasa</italic>, group B showed better results. This may be due to the sudden reduction of postnasal drip due to the treatment. In <italic>Mukhadaurgandhya</italic> also, group B showed better results, which suggests that <italic>Pradhamana Nasya</italic> is very effective for removing <italic>Dushta Kapha</italic> quickly.</p><p>When we used Student's unpaired &#x02018;<italic>t</italic>&#x02019; test to compare the results in the combined group with that in the <italic>Trayodashanga Kwatha</italic> group, there is no statistically significant difference between the groups in the relief obtained in any of the symptoms. However, on analyzing the percentage of relief obtained, combined therapy gives better results in <italic>Shirahshula</italic>, postnasal drip, <italic>Shirogaurava, Kasa, Aruchi</italic>, and <italic>Mukha Daurgandhya</italic> than does <italic>Trayodashanga Kwatha</italic> alone.</p><p>On comparing the Group C (Combine therapy) with Group B (<italic>Pradhamana Nasya</italic>), Group C showed better (highly significant) results in <italic>Kasa</italic> and <italic>Mukha Daurgandhya</italic> and significantly better results in postnasal discharge. In other symptoms like <italic>Nasasrava, Shirogaurav</italic> and <italic>Aruchi</italic>, symptom wise Group C showed better results than Group B but the difference is statistically insignificant.</p><p>Better results in the <italic>Sarvadehika Lakshanas</italic> were also seen in the combined group. the combined group also showed less recurrence of the symptoms after completion of treatment as compared to the other two groups. This may be due to an immunomodulatory property of the drug. Recurrence was more common in group B than in the other groups. This may be due to incomplete <italic>Shodhana</italic>. While <italic>Nasya</italic> will relieve the local pathology, the general vitiation of <italic>Doshas</italic> and <italic>Agni</italic> is not dealt with efficiently; hence, though rapid symptomatic relief may be seen after <italic>Nasya</italic>, recurrence can occur.</p><p>The variations in the results also depend upon the chronicity of the disease, effect of the weather, and the <italic>Bala</italic> of the individuals.
