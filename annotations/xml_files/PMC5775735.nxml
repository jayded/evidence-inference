At baseline and 3 months post treatment, all subjects were evaluated for the following: dry eye symptoms with a standard dry eye questionnaire (the Standard Patient Evaluation for Eye Dryness [SPEED]), meibomian gland (MG) function by counting the number of glands yielding liquid secretion with the MG evaluator (MGE), tear breakup time (TBUT) and corneal and conjunctival staining.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>In the VTP group, at 3 months, there was a significant improvement in MG function (4.00&#x000b1;1.47 to 7.73&#x000b1;5.53), SPEED score (11.00&#x000b1;3.30 to 5.42&#x000b1;2.15), TBUT (6.26&#x000b1;2.01 to 8.44&#x000b1;1.81), corneal staining (0.38&#x000b1;0.50 to 0.12&#x000b1;0.33) and conjunctival staining (1.69&#x000b1;1.93 to 0.62&#x000b1;0.85). In the doxycycline group, there was a significant improvement in MG function (4.63&#x000b1;1.41 to 10.63&#x000b1;5.91), SPEED score (13.42&#x000b1;4.17 to 9.42&#x000b1;5.47) and conjunctival staining (2.38&#x000b1;1.88 to 1.13&#x000b1;1.51), but the improvement in TBUT (6.90&#x000b1;2.56 to 7.59&#x000b1;2.03) and corneal staining (0.21&#x000b1;0.41 to 0.13&#x000b1;0.34) was not statistically significant (<italic>p</italic>=0.262 and <italic>p</italic>=0.414, respectively). At 3 months, SPEED score was significantly better in the VTP group (<italic>p</italic>&#x0003c;0.05); other parameters were comparable between the two groups.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>A single 12-minute bilateral VTP procedure was significantly more effective than the 3-month daily course of oral doxycycline at improving the dry eye symptoms secondary to MGD. A single 12-minute VTP treatment was at least as effective as a dose of doxycycline for 3 months, in improving MG function and all measured signs of MGD. Given the minimal risk profile of the single VTP procedure over long-term doxycycline use, a single VTP presents a favorable alternative to long-term antibiotic use.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>meibomian gland dysfunction</kwd><kwd>dry eye</kwd><kwd>vectored thermal pulsation</kwd><kwd>LipiFlow</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) has recently been recognized as the leading cause of dry eye.<xref rid="b1-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> MGD is a highly prevalent, chronic and progressive condition that can be diagnosed by observable compromise to the function and/or structure of the meibomian glands (MGs).

The total SPEED score was calculated as the sum of the frequency and severity scores for all symptoms over a range from 0 to 28.</p><p>The MG assessment was performed at a slit lamp using a hand-held instrument, the MGE (TearScience, Inc.), to ensure consistency of pressure applied to the glands.<xref rid="b4-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b19-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> The MGE approximates the force of a deliberate blink in yielding secretions from the glands.<xref rid="b18-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> This instrument was held in place for 10&#x02013;15 seconds, while the number of MGs expressing clear liquid secretions along the entire lower eyelid was counted and recorded.</p><p>TBUT was performed with Dry Eye Test (DET) fluorescein strips (Amcon Laboratories, St Louis, MO, USA) using previously described DET method.<xref rid="b20-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The DET strip was moistened with a single drop of saline and held vertically to allow the excess saline to run off. Patients were instructed to look down and toward the hand opposite to the eye receiving the stain. After retracting the upper eyelid, the strip was applied to superior temporal bulbar conjunctiva. To observe fluorescein breakup, the standard slit-lamp cobalt blue filter was used. Tear film breakup was defined as the first observed breakup of the tear film following the third blink. The measurements were recorded with the help of a stop watch, and an average of three readings was obtained for data analysis.</p><p>For corneal and conjunctival staining, the respective dyes were instilled using commercially available saline and standard fluorescein (Akorn, Inc., Farmington, CT, USA) and lissamine green strips (Bernell Corporation, Mishawaka, IN, USA). Each strip was moistened with a single drop of saline. The moistened strips were used to place the stain in the inferior cul-de-sac of each eye. After waiting for 90 seconds post dye instillation, the ocular surface (cornea and conjunctiva) was evaluated for staining.</p><p>Based on the report of the National Eye Institute/Industry (NEI) Workshop on Clinical Trials in Dry Eye,<xref rid="b21-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> corneal fluorescein (CF) staining was graded in five regions of the cornea on a scale of 0 (none) to 3 (severe) with a total score of 15.

The inner portion of the activator applied a constant temperature of 42.5&#x000b0;C to the tarsal conjunctiva of upper and lower eyelids. Simultaneously, the outer portion of the activator applied directional, pulsatile pressure to the external eyelid surfaces (maximum 6 psi) for the 12-minute treatment cycle. Consequently, the subjects felt warmth and pressure on their eyelids during the 12-minute bilateral procedure. All subjects were monitored throughout the process, and both the eyes were examined at the slit lamp at the end of the procedure.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>The study sample size was based on a power analysis of the primary study end points and the null hypothesis that the single VTP treatment would be non-inferior to the 3-month daily dose of doxycycline (power 80%, alpha =0.05).</p><p>Data analysis was performed using SPSS software for Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA).

Overall, the differences may be explained, in part, by different grading methods, especially for MGD which has evolved significantly in the past few years, different levels of severity of MGD and dry eye-associated anatomical changes in the ocular surface and eyelid.</p><p>The outcomes of a single VTP procedure in the current study are in alignment with the numerous other studies documenting a predictably significant improvement in MG function<xref rid="b4-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b22-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b23-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> and reduction in dry eye symptoms<xref rid="b4-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b9-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="b19-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b22-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b24-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> after a single VTP treatment. While several studies also report significant improvement in TBUT after VTP,<xref rid="b4-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b23-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> there are some that were not able to show statistically significant improvement in TBUT.<xref rid="b22-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="b24-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="b25-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">25</xref> The results of the current study demonstrated significant improvement in TBUT in the VTP-treated eyes. The mean corneal staining scores have been reported to improve significantly following the VTP procedure.<xref rid="b4-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b23-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Similarly, the mean CF staining scores improved significantly in the VTP group of the current study. The conjunctival staining has not been studied extensively in the previous literature; a single study reported small but statistically significant increase in the mean conjunctival staining scores in the VTP group, at 4 weeks from baseline.<xref rid="b4-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> As expected from the overall improvement in ocular surface health in the VTP group of the current study, we found significant improvement in the mean CLG scores.</p><p>The mean MGYLS scores of the two groups were found to be not statistically significantly different from one another both pre and post treatment. The VTP procedure is known to improve the MG function, so the study results are in alignment with what would be expected. The improvement in gland function as a result of the daily use of doxycycline for 3 months was not as clearly predicted by the literature. The previously reported favorable biochemical changes in MGSs following systemic tetracycline analog administration may explain the improvement in gland function. For example, Foulks et al<xref rid="b12-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> reported changes in the characteristics and biochemical composition of MGSs following 4 weeks of oral doxycycline treatment in patients with MGD. Souchier et al<xref rid="b26-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">26</xref> reported alterations in the meibomian fatty acid composition after 8-week therapy with minocycline, a tetracycline analog similar to doxycycline. Branched chain fatty acids (BCFAs), particularly isoC20, were found to be decreased. Higher levels of BCFAs are assumed to have detrimental effect on MG epithelium and been correlated with the keratinization of MG.<xref rid="b27-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> It has been hypothesized that lower levels of BCFAs and correspondingly higher levels of C16 and C18 saturated fatty acids may enhance the fluidity and stability of the tear film, thus improving the dry eye symptoms.<xref rid="b26-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">26</xref></p><p>While this study demonstrates that the daily use of doxycycline for 3 months can improve the signs and symptoms of moderate-to-severe MGD, the use of doxycycline is not without complication. There are many known side effects which serve to decrease patient compliance and may result in the termination of treatment altogether. This was evidenced in the current study; two subjects (14%) in the doxycycline group discontinued their treatment regimen due to stomach upset/intolerance to study medication. Previous publications reporting on the use of doxycycline for dry eye have documented numerous side effects, such as gastrointestinal problems (esophagitis, nausea, dyspepsia, diarrhea, abdominal cramps and decreased appetite), dermatological effects (itchy skin, urticaria and erythematous papules), hypersensitivity reactions (allergy and fever), increased tendency to bleed and stomatitis.<xref rid="b14-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> Doxycycline has also been linked to liver failure and teratogenicity.<xref rid="b28-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">28</xref> Depending upon the dose and duration of doxycycline treatment, side effects have been reported in as high as 40% of the subjects.<xref rid="b14-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="b15-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In addition, medical literature outside ophthalmology has reported some rare side effects such as esophageal ulcers, light-sensitive eruptions, photo-onycholysis and hypersensitivity syndrome reactions, single organ dysfunction and serum sickness such as reaction with doxycycline treatment.<xref rid="b29-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b33-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">33</xref> Its long-term use has been related to potential development of bacterial resistance and increased risk of secondary infections with other organisms (particularly <italic>Candida</italic> sp.).<xref rid="b34-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> Sub-microbial dosing of doxycycline has been advocated to lessen side effects and risk of microbial resistance, but even at low doses nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, headache, hypertension, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) elevation and abdominal pain have been reported.<xref rid="b15-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="b35-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">35</xref></p><p>As a chronic and progressive condition, MGD requires long-term management. The long-term safety concerns with doxycycline use render it a short-term, albeit sometimes necessary, option at best. In contrast, the VTP procedure lasts only 12 minutes, has an exceptional safety profile<xref rid="b4-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="b22-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and has been shown to result in sustained clinically significant improvement in gland function and reduced dry eye symptoms observed over 12&#x02013;36 months.<xref rid="b5-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b9-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> Consistent with the previous findings, no adverse events were found for VTP-treated eyes in this study. A single 12-minute VTP procedure presents a favorable alternative to the long-term use of oral antibiotics.</p><p>There are several limitations to this study: 1) it is a small study, thus serving as a pilot study for additional investigations; 2) as is typical in clinical practice, the adjunctive lid hygiene treatments that patients use for MGD and to manage other lid conditions are customized to the needs of the patient. What was consistent between patients was the restriction to make no changes to the at-home therapies for the study period; 3) blinking exercises were not prescribed in this study.</p><p>Over its disease course, untreated MGD is considered to result in irreversible anatomical damage to the MGs. Recently, Blackie et al<xref rid="b5-opth-12-161" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> provided clinical evidence in support of the hypothesis that early intervention for MGD optimizes the therapeutic outcomes. They reported significant association between greater mean improvement in MGS scores and patient characteristics such as less severe baseline scores and shorter duration of time between the diagnosis and treatment of MGD. In this study, the subjects had more advanced disease prior to treatment. Even so, the results of a single VTP treatment were compelling. Based on these results, one could hypothesize that VTP in combination with short-term doxycycline use may be a highly effective treatment option for more advanced stages of MGD. The authors hypothesize that such a combined approach may induce positive changes in the fatty acid composition of MGSs which may be better amenable to liquefaction and clearance of obstruction by VTP procedure. It could possibly also improve the duration of treatment effect of a single VTP procedure. Future studies are warranted to evaluate the proposed synergistic role of VTP procedure with short-term doxycycline use.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this prospective, randomized, parallel-group, single-masked study, a single 12-minute bilateral VTP procedure was significantly more effective than the 3-month daily course of oral doxycycline at improving the dry eye symptoms secondary to MGD. A single VTP treatment was at least as good as the daily doxycycline in improving MG function and all measured signs of MGD for moderate-to-severe MGD. Given the minimal risk profile of the single VTP procedure over long-term doxycycline use, a single VTP procedure presents a favorable alternative to long-term antibiotic use.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="COI-statement"><p><bold>Disclosure</bold></p><p>RB is a consultant for TearScience, Inc.
