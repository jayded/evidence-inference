Introduction</title><p>Lipid emulsion (LE) is one of the most important components of parenteral nutrition (PN), and provides energy as well as essential fatty acids. LEs rectify the deficiency in old PN protocols that are characterized by hyperglycemia caused by a single energy source from glucose and an inadequacy of essential fatty acids [<xref rid="B1-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="B2-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. However, LEs also have some variable biological effects due to different fatty acid composition or other components in different lipids [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Intralipid is the first long-chain LE based on soybean oil, and rich in &#x003c9;-6 polyunsaturated fat acids (PUFAs) (e.g., linoleic acid). High &#x003c9;-6 PUFA content produces too much pro-inflammatory eicosanoids, such as 2-series prostaglandins, 2-series thromboxanes and 4-series leukotrienes, which play important roles in the pro-inflammatory response and immunosuppression [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Many animal and clinical studies have shown that soybean oil-based LE induces oxidative stress, exaggerates the inflammatory response, hinders immune function, and increases the rate of infection [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B3-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="B11-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].</p><p>To reduce the adverse effects of soybean oil-based LE, two strategies have been adopted. One is the advent of mixed LE with medium-chain triglyceride (MCT) and long-chain triglyceride (LCT), in which half of the LCT is replaced by MCT, which theoretically reduces the side effects arising from too much &#x003c9;-6-PUFAs in LCT [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B13-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. Another mixed LE is olive oil-based LE, which is composed of 80% olive oil and 20% soybean oil, in which the latter is sufficient to provide essential fat acids, but the &#x003c9;-9 monounsaturated fatty acids in the olive oil exhibited no similar adverse effect as &#x003c9;-6-PUFAs in soybean oil [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="B14-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>].</p><p>At present, both the olive oil-based LE and MCT/LCT LE are widely used for PN in China. However, few studies have focused on a comparison of the two LEs&#x02019; effects on inflammation and immunity. One <italic>in vitro</italic> study indicated that an olive oil-based LE was associated with bacterial recovery comparable to saline in the liver and lung rat model of systemic bacterial infection, while bacterial recovery rates from these organs were significantly higher for MCT/LCT and LCT [<xref rid="B9-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In studies on neutrophil response [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], LEs inhibited calcium mobilization, a sign of cell activation, with emulsions including MCT having the greatest effect and olive oil&#x02013;based LE the weakest effect [<xref rid="B15-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="B16-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="B17-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. Likewise LEs based on MCT/LCT or soybean oil influenced many other neutrophil responses, but olive oil-based LE was largely without effect [<xref rid="B17-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="B18-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. In a study conducted in healthy volunteers, researchers found that MCT/LCT LE (500 mL given during 6 h) induced lymphocyte and neutrophil death [<xref rid="B19-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In addition, a clinical study conducted in abdominal surgery patients showed that those patients who received olive oil-based LE had a lower level of pro-inflammatory cytokines, TNF-howed that than patients receiving MCT/LCT or soybean oil-based LE [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. All these studies indicated that the olive oil-based LE might have less pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive effects, and be associated with a lower infection risk in patients receiving PN than MCT/LCT.</p><p>Esophagectomy is a severely stressful operation characterized by cell-mediated immunosuppression preceded by a hyperinflammatory response, and with a high perioperative risk of infectious complications [<xref rid="B11-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>,<xref rid="B21-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>,<xref rid="B22-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="B23-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. After esophagectomy, oral food intake is not allowed immediately, and EN combined with PN plays a key role in promoting patient recovery [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>].</p><p>To our knowledge, there is no study comparing the use of olive oil-based LE with MCT/LCT LE in esophageal cancer patients. We hypothesized that olive oil-based LE might be a better alternative with a lower perioperative infection risk than MCT/LCT, and designed the present study to investigate the differences in the two LEs with regard to their effects on clinical outcome, immune function and inflammatory response in esophageal cancer patients who had undergone surgery and were receiving EN.</p></sec><sec><title>2.

When the patients exited from the study, researchers had to make the final assessment, and document the early termination in the case report form. Strict follow-up had to be performed for patients who quit the study.</p><p>The study was conducted at Tangdu Hospital, a major teaching hospital affiliated with the Fourth Military Medical University and at Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer center in Southern China. Informed consent was obtained prior to randomization from study participants and the study was approved by Tangdu Hospital Ethics Committee at the Fourth Military Medical University. A research pharmacist at each institution coordinated treatment assignment following a computer-generated randomization table.</p></sec><sec><title>2.3. Surgical Approach and Process</title><p>Postoperative nutrition support for esophageal cancer patients was achieved through early EN combined with PN. The nutritional goal was 25~30 kcal/kg in both groups. A PN channel through the internal jugular vein or subclavian vein was established during anesthesia, and a nasoduodenal feeding tube was placed at operation when finishing anastomosis. EN was started with an initial dose of 200&#x02013;250 mL of oligomeric or polymeric formula under 20 mL/h from nasoduodenal tube within 24 h after esophagectomy. EN dose was gradually increased every 12&#x02013;24 h if there were no problems related to EN, and reached a maximum dose 6&#x02013;7 days after starting EN in both groups. PN was started on the next day after esophagectomy and lasted for &#x0003e;7 days. Apart from the different LEs (20% olive oil-based LE, 250 mL <italic>vs.</italic> 20% MCT/LCT LE, 250 mL) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="nutrients-06-00111-t001">Table 1</xref>), PN in the two groups had the same ingredients: glucose, amino acids, glutamine, electrolytes, multivitamins and trace elements. We dispensed the PN using a double chamber bag (Baxter Healthcare) with a total volume of 3 L. We infused the PN solution by an all-in-one method through the internal jugular or subclavian vein once daily, with total energy provided by PN of 17.5 kcal/kg/day (provided by glucose and lipid). For an average weight of 60 kg, the patients received 1050 kcal total energy, 150 g glucose, 50 g lipid from PN, and the glucose energy <italic>vs.</italic> lipid energy rate was 16:9. The glucose <italic>vs.</italic> insulin rate was 4:1. No other immunonutrition was added to PN. This nutritional prescription was designed according to ESPEN Guidelines on PN for surgery [<xref rid="B26-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] or intensive care [<xref rid="B27-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] and met the basic needs for energy and liquid. We also included the same preventive antibiotics in the two groups. After 7 days PN, oral food intake was allowed on day 8 for patients with no anastomosis leakage or other complications affecting oral feeding. Otherwise, oral feeding was delayed according to the individual situation. Liver and renal function was measured at regular intervals.</p><p>The primary endpoint of the study was the number of infectious complications (pneumonia, bacteremia, wound infection, central venous catheter-related (CVCR) infection, urinary tract infection and anastomosis leakage), as described previously [<xref rid="B28-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Secondary endpoints were other clinical outcomes, including perioperative fever (&#x0003e;38 &#x000b0;C), length of hospital stay &#x0003e; 14 days, critical care stay &#x0003e; 2 days, in-hospital mortality, oral food intake at day 8, immunological markers, and inflammatory indicators.</p><table-wrap id="nutrients-06-00111-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="pii">nutrients-06-00111-t001_Table 1</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>The compositions of the two lipid emulsions.</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Compositions</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Olive oil based LE</th><th align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MCT/LCT</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Soybean oil (g/L)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">40</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Olive oil (g/L)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">160</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">MCT (g/L)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">0</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">100</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Phospholipid (g/L)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">12</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Glycerol (g/L)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">22.5</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">25</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Energy (kcal/L)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">2000</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">1908</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Osmolarity (mosm/L)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">270</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">380</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">PH</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">7&#x02013;8</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">6.5&#x02013;8.5</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Saturated fatty acids (SFA) (%)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">15</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">60</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Mon-unsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) (%)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">65</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">10</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">Essential poly-unsaturated fatty acids (EPUFA) (%)</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">20</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">30</td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">&#x003c9;-6 PUFAs:&#x003c9;-3 PUFAs</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">9:1</td><td align="center" valign="middle" rowspan="1" colspan="1">8:1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></sec><sec><title>2.4.

Discussion</title><p>This prospective, double-blind randomized trial aimed compared differences in clinical outcomes in surgical esophageal cancer patients receiving EN combined with PN containing olive-oil-based or MCT/LCT LEs. We observed similar rates of infectious complications, and no significant differences in peri-operative fever (&#x0003e;38 &#x000b0;C), length of hospital stay, length of critical care stay (&#x0003e;2 days), in-hospital mortality, and time for oral food intake in esophageal cancer patients who had undergone surgery and were receiving EN. In addition, apart from the test group showing a greater increase in IgG level than the MCT/LCT group did, we detected little difference in immunological markers and inflammatory indicators between the two groups with PN containing different LEs.</p><p>Nutritional support for esophageal cancer patients undergoing surgery is one of the main indications for PN [<xref rid="B24-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="B25-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. However, recent randomized trials and meta-analyses have suggested that treatment with PN may increase the risk for infectious complications and hospital mortality [<xref rid="B31-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="B32-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="B33-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. The increased rate of PN-associated complications is likely multifactorial, but may be related to immunological suppression or proinflammatory response of specific PN components, including administration of conventional soybean oil-based LE, which contains a high content of linoleic acid and &#x003c9;-6 PUFAs [<xref rid="B2-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="B4-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B5-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="B6-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>,<xref rid="B7-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>,<xref rid="B8-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>,<xref rid="B9-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="B10-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Some studies have attributed their effect partially to the different fatty acid composition of the LEs [<xref rid="B34-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and that fatty acid constituents of parenteral LEs modify the immune response via alterations in membrane structure and fluidity, eicosanoid production, cell signaling, and gene expression [<xref rid="B7-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Olive oil-based LE and MCT/LCT are well-known LEs designed to decrease the adverse effects of soybean oil-based LE [<xref rid="B4-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="B12-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Intravenous infusion of these two lipids may lead to a milder effect on the immune system.</p><p>However, the evidence is insufficient to define clearly the role of MCT/LCT with regard to its immunological effects. A meta-analysis summarized the published data before 2006, and found that none of the lipid regimens, including MCT/LCT, showed a clear effect on the evolution of immunological status in humans [<xref rid="B12-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In our research, after the administration of MCT/LCT LE in PN for 7 days, lymphocyte count increased significantly. This is in line with the previous two studies suggesting that MCT/LCT emulsions are superior to 100% LCT emulsions, by having an immuno-restorative effect with regard to lymphocyte function [<xref rid="B35-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>,<xref rid="B36-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. However, in contrast, in a clinical study in healthy humans, intravenous infusion of an MCT/LCT LE was associated with decreased lymphocyte count [<xref rid="B37-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. Unlike MCT/LCT, the immunological neutrality of olive-oil-based LE has been confirmed by preclinical and clinical studies, with little effect on immune cell function [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="B38-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>,<xref rid="B39-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. One <italic>in vitro</italic> study showed that the oleic acid-rich olive oil-based LE was associated with less lymphocyte apoptosis, necrosis and DNA fragmentation compared with linoleic acid rich in LCT [<xref rid="B38-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Another in vitro study showed that upregulation of activated antigens involved in T cell proliferation was enacted by LCT, but unaffected by olive oil-based LE [<xref rid="B3-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Buenestado <italic>et al.</italic>, [<xref rid="B18-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] showed that olive oil-based LE had no effect on lymphocytes and little effect on neutrophil function and leukocyte endothelial cell interaction. In our study, there was no change in lymphocyte count and subpopulation percentage in patients given PN containing olive oil-based LE for 7 days, which supports the minor effect of olive oil-based LE on cell-mediated immunity. However, we also measured immunoglobulins and complement, which reflect the humoral immune response [<xref rid="B39-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. After 7 days PN, IgA, IgG, IgM and C3 levels increased significantly in both groups, suggesting that both LEs promote the recovery of humoral immunity in patients undergoing esophagectomy. In addition, it was particularly interesting that the IgG level increased more significantly in patients receiving olive oil-based LE compared with MCT/LCT. This indicates that olive oil-based LE has greater activity in promoting recovery of humoral immunity. However, our results are insufficient to support the view that olive oil-based LE induces less cell-mediated immunosuppression than MCT/LCT emulsion.</p><p>With regard to the proinflammatory response, both LEs had a neutral effect on TNF-&#x003b1;, IL-6 and CRP in our study. In our opinion, this can be attributed to a decreased &#x003c9;-6 PUFA content in olive oil-based LE and MCT/LCT LE. The &#x003c9;-6 PUFA in soybean oil was associated with production of proinflammatory eicosanoids, which tend to regulate additional inflammatory mediators [<xref rid="B40-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. Two studies support this view [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="B41-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. One study demonstrated that total production of TNF-&#x003b1; increased significantly after receiving soybean oil-based LE, although there was no change in the MCT/LCT group [<xref rid="B41-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The other study in abdominal surgery patients found that those who received olive oil-based LE had a low level of proinflammatory cytokines, TNF-&#x003b1; and IL-6 when compared with patients receiving MCT/LCT or soybean oil-based LE [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. However, unlike the study by Demirer <italic>et al.</italic>, [<xref rid="B20-nutrients-06-00111" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], there was no difference in the effects of olive oil-based LE and MCT/LCT LE on proinflammatory cytokines in our study.</p><p>The primary endpoint of our study was overall infection rate and the data showed no difference between the two LEs for infection rate. This was mainly due to similar effects on the immune system and proinflammatory response for the two LEs. The main reason may have been the relatively small number of patients enrolled in our study. Nonetheless, our study was unique in that it was, to the best of our knowledge, the first rigorous, double-blind trial to compare infection rates and other clinical outcomes and inflammatory and immune parameters after PN containing olive oil-based and MCT/LCT-based LE in esophageal cancer patients after surgery.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, our study indicated that administration of EN combined with PN containing olive oil-based and MCT/LCT-based LE had similar effects on perioperative clinical outcomes, cell-mediated immunity, and proinflammatory response in esophageal cancer patients who had undergone surgery and were receiving EN. Further clinical trials with large numbers of patients are needed to clarify the potential advantage of olive oil-based LE on the humoral immune system.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Yan Wang for her aid with the statistics, and Jian-fei Zhu and Zhe Li for their help in recruiting patients.</p></ack><notes><title>Conflicts of Interest</title><p>The authors declare no conflicts of interest.</p></notes><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="B1-nutrients-06-00111"><label>1.</label><element-citation publication-type="journal">
