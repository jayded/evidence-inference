We explored whether differences in genomic architecture represented by a chromosome conformation signature (CCS) in blood taken from early RA patients before methotrexate (MTX) treatment could assist in identifying non-response to DMARD and, whether there is an association between such a signature and RA specific expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p id="Par2">We looked for the presence of a CCS in blood from early RA patients commencing MTX using chromosome conformation capture by EpiSwitch&#x02122;. Using blood samples from MTX responders, non-responders and healthy controls, a custom designed biomarker discovery array was refined to a 5-marker CCS that could discriminate between responders and non-responders to MTX. We cross-validated the predictive power of the CCS by generating 150 randomized groups of 59 early RA patients (30 responders and 29 non-responders) before MTX treatment. The CCS was validated using a blinded, independent cohort of 19 early RA patients (9 responders and 10 non-responders). Last, the loci of the CCS markers were mapped to RA-specific eQTL.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p id="Par3">We identified a 5-marker CCS that could identify, at baseline, responders and non-responders to MTX. The CCS consisted of binary chromosome conformations in the genomic regions of IFNAR1, IL-21R, IL-23, CXCL13 and IL-17A. When tested on a cohort of 59 RA patients, the CCS provided a negative predictive value of 90.0% for MTX response. When tested on a blinded independent validation cohort of 19 early RA patients, the signature demonstrated a true negative response rate of 86 and a 90% sensitivity for detection of non-responders to MTX. Only conformations in responders mapped to RA-specific eQTL.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par4">Here we demonstrate that detection of a CCS in blood in early RA is able to predict inadequate response to MTX with a high degree of accuracy. Our results provide a proof of principle that a priori stratification of response to MTX is possible, offering a mechanism to provide alternative treatments for non-responders to MTX earlier in the course of the disease.</p></sec><sec><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><p>The online version of this article (10.1186/s12967-018-1387-9) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group xml:lang="en"><title>Keywords</title><kwd>Early rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>Methotrexate</kwd><kwd>Rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>DMARDs (synthetic)</kwd><kwd>Precision medicine drug response biomarkers</kwd><kwd>Methotrexate (MTX)</kwd><kwd>Chromatin conformation signatures (CCS)</kwd><kwd>Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL)</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group><funding-source><institution>Oxford BioDynamics</institution></funding-source></award-group></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>issue-copyright-statement</meta-name><meta-value>&#x000a9; The Author(s) 2018</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="Sec1"><title>Background</title><p id="Par22">Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune inflammatory disorder driven by interacting genetic, epigenetic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. The diagnosis of RA prompts early initiation of methotrexate (MTX), the first choice of disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) as recommended by European League against Rheumatism (EULAR) and American College of Rheumatology (ACR) &#x02018;treat-to-target&#x02019; strategy (target being remission or low disease activity). This approach has substantially improved outcomes in the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. However, approximately 35&#x02013;59% of patients do not achieve clinically meaningful responses after starting MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Predicting response to MTX has been one of the main challenges in RA management for over two decades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Delay of effective treatment has clinical implications as response to MTX is the most significant predictor of long-term&#x000a0;outcome in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The ability to identify biomarkers able to predict inadequate response has thus far proven challenging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Several attempts have been made to develop diagnostics able to predict MTX-response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>] (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1) however, most studies have failed.</p><p>RA is dependent on the interaction of genetic and environmental factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>]. Epigenetic markers are closely linked to transcriptional regulation and may reflect pathogenic changes associated with disease states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. The first evidence suggesting that epigenetic mechanisms may play a role in autoimmune diseases came from studies performed by Richardson et al. looking at the effect of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-azacytidine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>]. Other studies have also reported aberrant methylation in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR38">38</xref>]. Interestingly, MTX treatment also plays a role in epigenetic regulation in RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. Gene expression in mammals is regulated by non-coding elements that can impact physiology and disease; the principle mechanism of regulation is through the architectural status at both coding and non-coding genomic regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Under external perturbations, genomic regions can alter their 3-dimensional structure as a way of functional regulation of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. These structural changes can be measured by EpiSwitch, a high-throughput molecular technique that analyzes the spatial organization of genomic loci in a cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>]. As multiple genomic regions contribute to phenotypic differences through changes in genomic architecture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>], this approach allows for the development of a chromosomal conformation signature (CCS) of alterations in genomic architecture between two states (disease vs. non-disease, pre-treatment vs. post-treatment). The evaluation of long range chromosome interactions has provided useful blood-based biomarkers in oncology and other non-rheumatic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>]. CCS offer a stable, binary readout of cellular states and represent an emerging class of biomarkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. Here, we used a chromosomal architecture based approach to predict the response to MTX by developing a blood-based classifier based on a CCS. We hypothesized that interrogation of genomic architectural changes in early RA patients would define a functional endotype able to guide clinical decision making.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Patient population</title><p id="Par24">The SERA study is a national prospective inception cohort of patients with new RA or undifferentiated arthritis, together with age-gender matched controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR51">51</xref>].

Participants fulfilled the 2010 ACR/EULAR RA criteria at recruitment and commenced monotherapy with MTX.

We identified a 5-marker panel consisting of chromosomal conformations in the genomic loci of IFNAR1, IL-21R, IL-23, IL-17A, and CXCL13 that could identify R and NR to MTX with 90% sensitivity in an independent blinded validation cohort. This could facilitate earlier access to more effective therapies, thus avoiding disease progression, unnecessary exposure to potentially toxic drugs and diminished quality of life.</p><p id="Par37">Historically, identifying predictive biomarkers for MTX response has been difficult [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. While clinical predictors of RA disease are well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR61">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR62">62</xref>], they do not correlate well with response to treatment at the individual level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. 35&#x02013;59% of patients do not achieve clinically meaningful response after starting MTX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR63">63</xref>]. In the SERA study, only 30% of patients responded to MTX monotherapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. While the results presented here provide a proof-of-concept and further validation is warranted, the EpiSwitch technology has several attractive features from the standpoint of a biomarker that can be used clinically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>]. First, it requires a very small amount of blood sample (typically 50&#x000a0;&#x003bc;l). Second, it utilizes an established laboratory methodology and readouts (qPCR). Last, the turnaround time is short (~&#x000a0;8&#x000a0;h). Thus, once further validated, the approach described here faces low barriers to clinical adoption. The CCS defined a signature that suggests epigenomic control over loci with a central role in the IL-17/IL-23 axis, with the two most informative long-range chromatin interactions for predicting MTX-NR coming from IL-17A and CXCL13 loci. In agreement with our finding, earlier reports have suggested that IL-23, IFNAR1 and IL-21R are predictors of positive response in other diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR64">64</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR66">66</xref>], while IL-17A and CXL13 are predictors of poor outcome and increased disease severity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR67">67</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR71">71</xref>]. Several studies support the notion that IL-23/Th17 axis drive inflammation in chronic diseases and perhaps plays a role in the response to immunomodulating drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR75">75</xref>]. Interestingly, no loci previously associated with MTX metabolism were implicated in our study, indicating that the response to MTX was independent of how the drug is known to be metabolized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR76">76</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">Our results are consistent with previous data reporting the presence of regulatory elements (i.e. eQTL) only in the context of inflammatory diseases and not in healthy controls [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>].</p><p id="Par39">Recently, Walsh et al. reported that eQTL mapped from RA are particularly enriched in enhancer regions of disease related cell types such as T and B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. Previous studies have recognized that the eQTL are highly specific to different leucocyte subsets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR78">78</xref>]. To explore the concordance of CCS data with existing genetic regulatory datasets, we mapped the genomic locations of the regions in the CCS against reported RA-specific eQTL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. This revealed a high level of co-localization of R-specific loci (IFNR1, IL-21R, and IL-23) to RA-specific eQTL. Notably, this level of concordance was not observed in NR loci (IL-17 and CXCL-13). The increased association of RA eQTLs with CCS regions observed in R, but not in NR, suggest dysregulation at the level of regulatory 3D genome architecture. It has been reported that eQTL are associated with expression of mRNA transcripts, with concomitant effects on protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR79">79</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR82">82</xref>]. This leaves open the possibility that the association of eQTL with CCS observed in RA-R result from phenotypic consequences due to the effects of mRNA and protein expression levels. However, the impact of eQTL on protein levels remains poorly understood.</p><p id="Par40">It is now clear that the developing immune response is influenced by genetic and epigenetic factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. IFNAR1, IL-21R and IL-23 loci have been reported to play a key role in the pathogenesis of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR83">83</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR85">85</xref>] and Th17 cells are implicated in pathogenesis especially in the pre-RA phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR72">72</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR73">73</xref>]. Whether the CCS differences we observed represent changes impacting the pre-RA phase or are acquired during the early phase of RA is at present unclear. We hypothesize that the different genomic architecture observed for R and NR might reflect differences in epigenetic host responses to early pathogenetic events, or particular environmental exposures. We anticipate that the association observed between CCS and eQTL in RA patients may be important to understand the heterogeneity of the response observed between individuals. Furthermore, eQTLs present in active inflammatory diseases can disappear after treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR77">77</xref>]. It would therefore be useful to determine whether the concordance of the CCS and eQTL observed in our study in treatment na&#x000ef;ve RA responders will be linked only to the disease or change after MTX treatment. Moreover, it would be interesting to see whether the reported eQTL are linked to the disease state and/or the level of inflammation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR68">68</xref>]. Our data indicate that the mapping of the QTL can reveal an altered biological status in R and NR, however further studies are needed to confirm this.</p><p id="Par41">The samples used in this study came from the SERA study, a large, multi-institutional investigational program designed to identify predictive markers of RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>]. Patients enrolled in the SERA study were carefully characterized for clinical phenotype (the majority of the patients were Caucasians, non-smokers with seropositive established disease), longitudinal follow-up of outcomes and blood samples were stored following a Standard Operating Procedure. This combination of clinical rigor and quality assurance of the inputs to the CCS are particular strengths of this study. An additional strength of the study is the approach that was used to generate the CCS. We focused on the discovery and establishment of a molecular signature using an approach informed by current biological knowledge. We evaluated a network of loci that had plausible pathophysiological relevance in RA via synovial pathogenesis studies, GWAS association and postulated MTX pharmacogenetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR54">54</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR86">86</xref>]. The step-wise selection of biomarkers used in this study, coupled with the strict separation of discovery and validation cohorts, was performed to prevent marker and model over-fitting. The robust statistical properties of the CCS classifier are another advantage of the approach presented here. Using epigenetic markers, which provide a binary readout (presence or absence) and are stable in isolated whole blood, provides high efficiency stratification. Statistical power analysis confirmed that the sample size was adequate for the development and evaluation of the signature, a critical step in biomarker development and aligned with successful development of companion diagnostics in limited size cohorts in other indications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR87">87</xref>]. A further strength to our findings and applicability in the clinical setting is the ability to identify this molecular signature in the whole blood by using a drop of blood.</p><p id="Par42">Some of the caveats associated with our findings are the relatively modest sample size and the cellular heterogeneity present in the whole blood. While the sample size for the validation cohort was not as large as previous studies seeking to identify a biomarker for MTX non-response (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>: Table S1), the use of chromosome conformations as a readout, which can generate robust signatures in smaller cohorts, provide confidence in the approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR88">88</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR89">89</xref>]. The heterogeneity of cell populations is an issue that has implications for any analysis in whole blood. In RA, it is known that there is significant heterogeneity in cell populations present in the blood of RA patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR90">90</xref>]. While outside the scope of the current study, future studies that look at the CCS in distinct cell types in whole blood may shed greater light on the similarities and/or differences exhibited within individual populations. A final caveat of our study was limited in that it could not determine whether the observed epigenetic marks are causal or consequential (secondary to the inflammatory response). Future studies looking at larger patient sets as well as the inclusion of individuals treated with other DMARDs, including biologics, are warranted.</p></sec><sec id="Sec16" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p id="Par43">The ability to identify individuals who are unlikely to respond to a specific therapeutic agent has the potential to not only reduce side-effects to treatments that will provide no benefit but also accelerate their journey through the treatment algorithm and thus increase likelihood of a positive treatment outcome. Given the high worldwide prevalence of RA, a stratifying signature for MTX response offers direct and practical benefits. The validated classifier described here, which is based on five conditional binary biomarkers detected in the blood, offers cost-effective detection by an established ISO-certified industrial platform and the practicality that this method to stratify patients has the potential to be routinely available within clinical practice.
