Prior research demonstrated the effectiveness of regular long-term remote ischemic conditioning (RIC) in secondary stroke prevention in patients with intracranial stenosis. We hypothesized that RIC can serve as an effective adjunctive therapy to pharmacotherapy in preventing ischemic events in patients with AMIS/TIA. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and preliminary efficacy of daily RIC in inhibiting cerebrovascular/cardiovascular events after AMIS/TIA.</p></sec><sec id="st2"><title>Methods:</title><p>This is a single-arm, open-label, multicenter Phase IIa futility study with a sample size of 165. Patients with AMIS/TIA receive RIC as an additional therapy to secondary stroke prevention regimen. RIC consists of five cycles of 5-min inflation (200 mmHg) and 5-min deflation of cuffs on bilateral upper limbs twice a day for 90 days. The antiplatelet strategy is based on individual physician's best practice: aspirin alone, clopidogrel alone, or combination of aspirin and clopidogrel. We will assess the recurrence rate of ischemic stroke/TIA within 3 months as the primary outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="st3"><title>Conclusions:</title><p>The data gathered from the study will be used to determine whether a further large-scale, multicenter randomized controlled Phase II trial is warranted in patients with AMIS/TIA.</p></sec><sec id="st4"><title>Trial Registration:</title><p>ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03004820; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03004820">https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03004820</ext-link>.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Ischemic Preconditioning</kwd><kwd>Secondary Prevention</kwd><kwd>Stroke</kwd><kwd>Transient Ischemic Attack</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="sec1-1"><title>I<sc>NTRODUCTION</sc></title><p>Stroke is the number one cause of death in China.

The study will provide evidence whether or not to initiate a large-scale and multicenter randomized controlled clinical study or to avoid futile, expensive, and unnecessary Phase II trials.</p><p>PICNIC-One is expected to make several unique contributions in understanding the potential role of RIC in secondary stroke prevention. First, PICNIC-One will provide preliminary evidence of the efficacy of RIC as an adjunctive therapy to pharmacotherapy after an AMIS/TIA in the real-world practice. Second, PICNIC-One will advance the current knowledge of feasibility of applying long-term regular RIC in this subset of stroke population. To our knowledge, only several small clinical trials investigated the long-term regular RIC in stroke patients, and three of them were carried at the same single site.[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] It remains a concern whether patients could strictly follow the study protocol to use RIC twice daily (90 min daily) for 90 days. The feasibility of applying RIC in multiple sites is also uncertain and requires a careful feasibility assessment. The study has four sites in different regions of China: two of them are academic tertiary hospitals and the other two are nonacademic community hospitals. The electric autocontrol RIC device used in this study has the capacity to upload application data simultaneously through 4G signals to allow the study team to track the compliance rate. Third, PICNIC-One is expected to provide evidence of the safety of RIC. Adverse events related to RIC were not sufficiently assessed due to inadequate sample size. Although there have been no reports of RIC-related SAEs in prior clinical studies,[<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref><xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref><xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref><xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref><xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref><xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref><xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref><xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref><xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref><xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref><xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>] SAEs may occur at a low rate and may be only detected with large sample size and many studies.
