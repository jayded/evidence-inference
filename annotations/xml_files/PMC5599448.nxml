Pirfenidone (as a 267-mg capsule) is approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and is recommended in international treatment guidelines for the treatment of IPF in the majority of patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par6">Although the mechanism of action has not been fully established, pirfenidone is an antifibrotic agent that affects multiple biological pathways in vivo. Pirfenidone attenuates fibroblast proliferation and production of fibrosis-associated proteins and cytokines, and decreases biosynthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix in response to cytokine growth factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p id="Par7">Clinical studies in patients with IPF have shown that pirfenidone reduced the decline in forced vital capacity and the risk of all-cause mortality versus placebo at 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Pirfenidone is generally well tolerated; however, gastrointestinal and skin-related adverse events (AEs) can affect tolerability in some patients, particularly within the first 6&#x000a0;months of treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par8">Clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies have demonstrated that, after oral administration of pirfenidone in various oral formulations, peak plasma pirfenidone concentration (<italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub>) and area under the plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) are significantly higher in a fasted versus a fed state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The observed reduction in <italic>C</italic>

<sub>max</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Therefore, prescribing information recommends taking pirfenidone with food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>].</p><p id="Par9">Gradual dose titration on initiation of pirfenidone can help with the management of AEs and prevent treatment discontinuation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Currently, the pirfenidone capsule is available as a 267-mg capsule and the flexibility offered by the capsule formulation is key to facilitating tailored dosing until patients are established on a stable dose of pirfenidone. The recommended starting dose is 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;267-mg capsule three times daily (tid) for 1&#x000a0;week, followed by 2&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;267-mg capsules tid for 1&#x000a0;week, followed by the maintenance dosage of 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;267-mg capsules tid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. If AEs occur during pirfenidone treatment, temporary dose reduction followed by re-escalation can help to resolve AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p id="Par10">Once patients are on a stable maintenance dose of 2403&#x000a0;mg/day, they may benefit from having fewer pills to take daily. This could improve medication adherence, which is defined as the degree to which patients follow recommendations on the timing, dosage and frequency of their medications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Poor adherence may be associated with worse health outcomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and the prescribed number of dose units of medication daily may be an important factor in influencing adherence, with an increasing number of doses associated with poorer adherence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p><p id="Par11">Pirfenidone film-coated 801-mg tablets were developed to provide patients who are tolerating the recommended daily maintenance dose with an alternative to the 267-mg capsule formation. The reduced pill burden of taking 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;801-mg tablet tid has the potential to increase adherence in these patients.</p><p id="Par12">The aim of this study was to assess the bioequivalence of pirfenidone after a single-dose oral administration of 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;801-mg tablet compared with a single-dose of 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;267-mg capsules under fasted and fed states.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study Design</title><p id="Par13">This single-dose, Phase I, open-label, randomized, four-treatment-period, four-sequence, crossover PK study (NCT02525484) was designed to determine the bioequivalence of pirfenidone when administered via a tablet versus a capsule formulation in the fed and fasted states (Fig.&#x000a0;<xref rid="Fig1" ref-type="fig">1</xref>).<fig id="Fig1"><label>Fig.&#x000a0;1</label><caption><p>Study design. <italic>ICF</italic> informed consent, <italic>PK</italic> pharmacokinetic</p><p>

However, the guidelines also suggest that bioequivalence studies should generally be conducted under fed conditions for products recommended for administration with food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Similarly, the FDA recommends conducting bioequivalence studies under fasting and fed conditions for all orally administered immediate-release drug products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">In a previous PK study of the pirfenidone capsule formulation in healthy volunteers, the presence of food was associated with a reduction in <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> value versus the fasted state, which was correlated with a reduction in gastrointestinal AEs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. This finding reflects clinical practice, with patients advised to take pirfenidone with or after a meal; therefore, this study also investigated the PK and bioequivalence of the pirfenidone tablet formulation under fed conditions. Consistent with the previous study, our results indicate that the presence of food reduces the rate and extent of pirfenidone absorption from the tablet formulation. A statistically significant reduction in pirfenidone <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> was observed in the fed state versus the fasted state; whereas no statistically significant differences were observed for AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> measurements. The results of this study demonstrate that, in the fasted state, the pirfenidone 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;801-mg tablet is bioequivalent to 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;267-mg capsules. In the fed state, the bioequivalence criteria were met based on AUC<sub>0&#x02013;t</sub> and AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub> measurements, whereas the upper bound of the 90% CI values for <italic>C</italic>

<sub>max</sub> and shorter median <italic>t</italic>
<sub>max</sub> with the tablet formulation compared with the capsules suggest that pirfenidone undergoes faster absorption following administration of the tablet compared with the capsules when food is present. It is possible that release of pirfenidone from the capsule at the site of absorption is delayed following a high-fat meal. One hypothesis is that multiple lighter capsules may float in the fed stomach, whereas a single heavier tablet may sink and mix more readily, ultimately delaying gastric emptying for the more buoyant capsules compared with the tablet [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p id="Par38">The high-fat meal consumed during this study represented extreme dietary conditions, with subjects consuming approximately 800&#x02013;1000&#x000a0;calories, of which 50% were from fat. EMA and FDA guidelines recommend conducting fed bioequivalence studies using a high-fat, high-calorie meal to provide the greatest effect on gastrointestinal physiology, thereby a maximum food effect on systemic drug bioavailability could be investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In practice, dietary conditions would likely be intermediate to the fasted and fed states utilized in this study, and, therefore, the 17% increases in <italic>C</italic>

Overall, a smaller proportion of subjects experienced AEs in the fed state compared with the fasted state with both the tablet and capsule formulations.

<sub>max</sub> and risk of adverse gastrointestinal events were correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. In this study, under the fasted state, both formulations had similar incidences of AEs and a similar <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> was observed between the two dosage forms. In the fed state, a greater proportion of subjects experienced AEs with the tablet formulation compared with the capsule formulation. Although <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> was slightly higher with the tablet versus the capsule formulation, there was no apparent relationship between drug exposure and AEs based on a graphical examination of the exposure&#x02013;response relationship. For the tablet under fed conditions, the mean or median <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> (or AUC<sub>0&#x02013;&#x0221e;</sub>) values for the subjects who experienced AEs were trending higher; however, the overall distribution of individual exposure values for these subjects when compared with the subjects without AEs is similar. Taken together, these observations indicate that the slightly higher <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> observed with the tablet relative to the capsules in the fed state in this study is not expected to have a clinically meaningful impact on safety.</p><p id="Par41">Clinical studies in patients with IPF have shown that pirfenidone reduces the decline in forced vital capacity and the risk of all-cause mortality versus placebo at 1&#x000a0;year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. However, IPF is a chronic, progressive condition that requires long-term treatment. The simplified dosing regimen offered by the pirfenidone 801-mg tablet formulation may enhance longer-term adherence in patients once they are established on the recommended maintenance dose. Additional dose strengths, including 267- and 534-mg tablets, will accommodate the recommended dose titration and flexible dose modification until treatment is stabilized. Assessing the bioequivalence of the highest single dose is in accordance with the EMA and FDA guidelines, which state that it is sufficient to establish bioequivalence with the highest dose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Therefore, the results from this bioequivalence study, together with in vitro dissolution testing, support a biowaiver request for the 267- and 534-mg strengths of pirfenidone tablets.</p><p id="Par42">Although our study was conducted in accordance with EMA and FDA guidelines on the investigation of bioequivalence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], the limitations of our methodology should be acknowledged. The subjects included in our study were healthy volunteers aged 18&#x02013;55&#x000a0;years; however, in clinical practice, IPF is most commonly diagnosed in the seventh or eighth decade of life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Patients with IPF have also been shown to have a high burden of comorbidities and concomitant medication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Therefore, it is possible that the AE profile observed in our study might not be representative of the real-world setting. However, it should be noted that the safety profile of the pirfenidone capsule formulation has been extensively characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>], and no significant differences in safety profile between the capsule and tablet formulation are anticipated.</p></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par43">In conclusion, the results from this study demonstrated bioequivalence between the pirfenidone 1&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;801-mg tablet and pirfenidone 3&#x000a0;&#x000d7;&#x000a0;267-mg capsules in the fasted state in healthy adult volunteers. The small difference in <italic>C</italic>
<sub>max</sub> between the tablet and the capsules observed in the fed state is not expected to have a clinically meaningful impact on the benefit&#x02013;risk profile of pirfenidone, while the simplified dosing regimen with tablets may increase adherence to treatment.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic supplementary material</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
