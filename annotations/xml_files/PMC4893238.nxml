The present study evaluated if rebamipide protects against naproxen-induced gastric damage in healthy volunteers. Changes in gastric PGE2 tissue concentration were also evaluated.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>After a preliminary endoscopy to rule out previous gastric macroscopic damage, twenty-four healthy volunteers of both sexes were divided into 2 groups. One group received sodium naproxen 550&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. plus placebo for 7&#x000a0;days, while the other group received sodium naproxen 550&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. plus rebamipide 100&#x000a0;mg b.i.d. At the end of treatment, a new endoscopy was performed. Gastric macroscopic damage was evaluated by the Cryer score and by the modified Lanza score. The primary outcome measure of the trial was the macroscopic damage observed in each treatment group at the end of treatment. Biopsies were collected at both endoscopies for PGE2 quantification and histopathological analysis (secondary outcomes). Tissue PGE2 was quantified by ELISA. The randomization sequence was generated using 3 blocks of 8 subjects each. Volunteers and endoscopists were blind to whether they were receiving rebamipide or placebo.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>All recruited volunteers completed the trial.

All subjects tested negative for hepatitis B and C (except for serologic scar), as well as HIV I and II, and were instructed to abstain from taking any medication including over-the-counter medication for 2&#x000a0;weeks prior to and during the study period. Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion. All women enrolled had negative &#x003b2;-HCG.

The study was performed according to the 2008 revised Declaration of Helsinki for bio-medical research involving human subjects and the 1996 rules of Good Clinical Practices. The study protocol was approved by the Committee of Research Ethics of the University of Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, on 26 November 2014 (before the initiation of the study procedures), and the study is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, ID NCT02632812.</p><p>After performing a preliminary gastroduodenal endoscopy at the Vera Cruz Hospital (Campinas, Brazil) to rule-out prior macroscopic upper GI damage in the subjects, twenty-four healthy volunteers (12 men) were enrolled in the study.

The randomization sequence was determined using the randomization generator available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.randomization.com/">www.randomization.com</ext-link>, using 3 blocks of 8 subjects each. Volunteers were blind to whether they were receiving rebamipide or placebo. To assure adherence, the drugs were administered by a member of the research team&#x000a0;(also blind to treatment allocation) early in the morning and late in the evening for the whole duration of the study. A pharmacist was responsible for labeling treatments as A or B, and for breaking the code at the end of the study. Volunteers were required to be fasted in the morning and were only allowed to eat at least 2&#x000a0;h after administration of medications. In the evening, volunteers were required to be at least for 2&#x000a0;h without ingestion of food, and were also asked to avoid eating for the following 2&#x000a0;h after the dose.</p><p>Adverse reactions were individually evaluated.

Exams were performed by a single endoscopist. The primary outcome measure of the trial was the macroscopic damage observed in each treatment group at the end of treatment. The number of mucosal erosions after treatment was counted and macroscopic mucosal injury scored according to Cryer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>] and to the modified Lanza score (MLS; Table&#x000a0;<xref rid="Tab1" ref-type="table">1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>]. Gastroduodenal ulcers were classified according to the Sakita-Miwa classification. Additionally, a second endoscopist retrospectively evaluated the exams, blind to the scores given by the first endoscopist. If there was any difference between the score given by the two endoscopists, the final score would be the mean value of the two numbers. Both endoscopists were blind to treatment group allocation of volunteers. In each exam 3 biopsies were collected from the gastric antrum and 3 from the gastric corpus for PGE2 quantification. Samples were immediately washed in phosphate buffer saline at pH&#x000a0;7.4 and stored individually in a dry Eppendorf tube and kept at &#x02212;20&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C until analysis. Another 2 biopsies from each stomach region (4 total) were collected at each endoscopic procedure for histological analysis. Volunteers were questioned about GI symptoms at every dose. Changes in gastric PGE2 concentration, histopathological characteristics and GI symptoms at the end of the study compared to baseline were evaluated as secondary outcome measures. A more detailed questionnaire about GI symptoms such as heartburn, abdominal pain, fullness, nausea, vomiting, blood in stools or others was completed before receiving the first dose and at the last day of treatment. In the questionnaires, when any symptom was reported, the volunteer was asked to describe the intensity and frequency of the symptom over the previous 7&#x000a0;days. Routine laboratory tests were repeated at the end of treatment, including fecal occult blood test.<table-wrap id="Tab1"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Cryer and modified Lanza scores according to gastroduodenal mucosal injury</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Score</th><th>Cryer score</th><th>Modified Lanza score</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>0</td><td>Normal or erythema</td><td>No hemorrhage or erosion observed</td></tr><tr><td>1</td><td>Any amount of submucosal hemorrhage or edema without erosions.</td><td>One or two hemorrhages or erosions observed in one gastric area.</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1 erosion&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;submucosal hemorrhage or edema.</td><td>Three to five hemorrhages or erosions observed in one gastric area.</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2&#x02013;4 erosions&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;submucosal hemorrhage or edema.</td><td>Hemorrhages or erosions observed in two gastric areas; six or more hemorrhages or erosions observed in one gastric area, with the total number not exceeding ten in the entire stomach.</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>5 or more erosions and/or a single ulcer&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;submucosal hemorrhage or edema.</td><td>Hemorrhages or erosions observed in three or more gastric areas; eleven or more hemorrhages or erosions observed widely in the entire stomach.</td></tr><tr><td>5</td><td>Multiple ulcers&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;submucosal hemorrhage or edema.</td><td>Ulcer.</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>PGE2 quantification</title><p>Tissue PGE2 concentration was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using Cayman Chemical Monoclonal Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> EIA Kit (item number 514010).

This result differs from previous findings, in which rebamipide treatment resulted in less severe gastric damage induced by NSAIDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. One possible explanation for the different results found in the present work is that naproxen was more aggressive than others models of NSAID-induced gastric damage. To evaluate this possibility, previously published data was further analyzed. Treatment with indomethacin at 75&#x000a0;mg/day without rebamipide for 7 consecutive days resulted in a median MLS of 3. When treatment was associated with rebamipide 100&#x000a0;mg&#x000a0;t.i.d., median MLS was 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>]. Treatment with ibuprofen 1800&#x000a0;mg/day for 7 consecutive days without rebamipide resulted in a median MLS of 3. When volunteers received rebamipide concomitantly with ibuprofen, median MLS was 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. By performing the Mann&#x02013;Whitney <italic>U</italic>-test to compare MLS scores from the placebo group in the present study to those found in the placebo groups of the previously mentioned studies, no difference in gastric lesion scores among these 3 models of NSAID-induced gastric damage was observed (indomethacin vs. naproxen, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.475; ibuprofen vs. naproxen, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.343; indomethacin vs. ibuprofen, <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;1.0). However, since the characteristics of volunteers enrolled in the aforementioned studies are very different from those of the present study and trials designs are not the same, final conclusions cannot be drawn from these statistical analyses.</p><p>Since all the aforementioned studies evaluated Japanese or Korean subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], population characteristics may have influenced the results. Higher gastric pH is known to be a protective factor in NSAID-induced gastric damage. The incidence of hypochlorhydria in the Japanese population is higher than in western countries, affecting more than 40&#x000a0;% of individuals over 50&#x000a0;year olds in Japan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>], while in the Unites States the incidence varies from 8&#x000a0;% in young adults to 11&#x000a0;% in the elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. The higher gastric pH might facilitate the observation of the protective effect of rebamipide reported in Asian individuals. Another possibility for differences in rebamipide effects in NSAID-induced gastric damage is the genetic and dietary characteristics of the populations evaluated in each study.</p><p>One difference of the present study is that the daily dose of rebamipide was 200&#x000a0;mg, while most previous reports treated volunteers with 300&#x000a0;mg of rebamipide per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. However, rebamipide at 200&#x000a0;mg/day in patients with rheumatic disease showed a protective effect in NSAID-induced gastroduodenal mucosal injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. It is unlikely that a reduction in 33&#x000a0;% of the dose would abolish the supposed effect of rebamipide. A lower dosage of rebamipide was chosen due to safety concerns. Most of the safety data about rebamipide comes from studies in Asian populations. This is the first time a study evaluated effects of rebamipide in a Brazilian population.</p><p>Increased PG synthesis was previously suggested as a possible mechanism for mucosal protection of rebamipide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. If so, rebamipide should not have a protective effect in NSAID-induced gastric damage through modulation of PG synthesis, since NSAIDs block the activity of cyclooxygenases.</p><p>In the present study, no significant histopathological change of the gastric mucosa was seen at the end of treatment in neither groups, despite the clear aggressiveness of naproxen observed on macroscopy. These results confirm previous reports that identified the histological features characteristic of NSAID users only in a subset of patients, and that microscopic findings do not correlate with macroscopical damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. This may reflect that the histological parameters used lack sufficient sensitivity or else, the mechanism responsible for the appearance of erosions and ulcers is independent of the degree of inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="Sec13" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Rebamipide 200&#x000a0;mg/day does not protect against naproxen-induced gastroduodenal damage in healthy volunteers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec14"><title>Abbreviations</title><p>ELISA, Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; GI, Gastrointestinal; MLS, Modifies Lanza score; NSAIDs, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; PG, Prostaglandin.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec15"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12876_2016_472_MOESM1_ESM.docx" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1: Table S1.</label><caption><p>Gastrointestinal symptoms occurrence in the previous 7 days as reported by each volunteer before the initiation and at the end of treatments.
