The WHO estimates that globally 8&#x02013;10% of adults over the age of 25 have diabetes, approximately 90% with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Close control of blood glucose and blood pressure (BP) can reduce morbidity.<xref rid="R2" ref-type="bibr">2&#x02013;4</xref> As the prevalence of chronic conditions such as type 2 diabetes increases, it will become difficult to continue to provide the same level of healthcare staffing to manage these conditions as we do now. Many healthcare strategy documents advocate the use of telehealth (particularly telemonitoring and teleconsultation)<xref rid="R5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref> to streamline and improve the management of long-term conditions and produce engaged<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> and activated<xref rid="R7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> patients who manage their own condition well, requiring fewer consultations and fewer admissions to hospital. However, despite numerous pilot studies, the uptake of telehealth has been limited and in the UK and some healthcare providers are now disinvesting in telemonitoring technologies for a range of reasons<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> including negative results from some trials, and the cost and difficulty in sourcing systems which meet their needs.<xref rid="R9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>
<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> Telemonitoring, where the patient regularly measures signs and symptoms at home and makes them electronically available to their healthcare provider, is a complex intervention, requiring input from patients and providers. Analysis of the reasons for effectiveness or otherwise of complex interventions is best addressed using qualitative methods.<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> This paper presents the results of a qualitative study of telemonitoring in type 2 diabetes in the context of the effective Telescot Diabetes randomised controlled trial (RCT) which will be reported elsewhere (Trial registration number ISRCTN71674628).<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Good blood glucose control and good BP control (&#x0003c;130/80&#x02005;mm&#x02005;Hg) can substantially reduce the risk of cardiovascular complications in people with type 2 diabetes.<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> However, evidence of the value of self-monitoring blood glucose for those who are not on insulin is mixed.<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> It is not routinely recommended in the UK,<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>

<xref rid="R17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref> report that self blood glucose monitoring has a perceived negative impact on quality of life where the monitoring identifies problems which are not addressed, for example, when patients were aware of high readings for long periods in between clinic appointments.<xref rid="R18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> In contrast, telemonitoring provides timely sharing of clinical information with healthcare providers and the limited evidence available suggests it helps improve blood glucose control in type 2 diabetes,<xref rid="R19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> although the authors of a recent analysis of data from a large cluster RCT in England suggest that the improvement in blood glucose control may not be large enough to be clinically significant.<xref rid="R20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> The evidence for telemonitoring BP is growing,<xref rid="R21" ref-type="bibr">21&#x02013;26</xref> but the acceptability and impact of this in people with type 2 diabetes who are also being asked to monitor their blood glucose is unclear.</p><p>The Telescot programme consisted of a series of randomised controlled trials with embedded qualitative studies in telemonitoring in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), hypertension and diabetes, with additional pilot and qualitative studies of telemonitoring in heart failure and hypertension following stroke. The defining feature of this programme was that, unlike in many previous pilots/trials, telemonitoring was provided by the patients&#x02019; usual primary care practitioners so that apart from the telemonitoring, the same care was available to control and intervention groups. This approach was shown to be effective in improving the management of BP in people who did not have diabetes. In the trial which was the context for this qualitative study people with type 2 diabetes were asked to telemonitor three risk factors, blood glucose, BP and weight over a period of 9&#x02005;months. This added complexity to telemonitoring for patients and practitioners, necessitating this qualitative study to examine process and reasons for the effectiveness or otherwise of this complex intervention. All patients had poor blood glucose control at the start of the study, but not necessarily poor BP control.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>A number of qualitative studies from this programme have already been published<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;33</xref> and strong themes are emerging.

<xref rid="R29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref> However, although healthcare practitioners recognised the potential patient benefits, they were concerned that some patients may become dependent on the technology and anxious about their condition,<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;30</xref>

An interpretive descriptive approach<xref rid="R34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref> was employed, acknowledging that in health services research the need of the researcher is not simply to provide a description of the phenomenon, but also to produce an interpretive account which will help to guide healthcare innovation while, at the same time, recognising the subjective nature of the encounter between the participant and the researcher.<xref rid="R35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref> Although there is evidence from our own and others&#x02019; research, that patients&#x02019; and professionals&#x02019; perceptions and experiences of telemonitoring may differ<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;32</xref>
<xref rid="R36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>
<xref rid="R37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref> both perspectives need to be considered together in the context of an interpretive descriptive approach to a service delivered in partnership, and are necessary to inform a rounded interpretation of the data in this study.<xref rid="R38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>
<boxed-text id="bx1" position="float" orientation="portrait"><label>Box 1</label><caption><title>Telemonitoring intervention</title></caption><p>Participants in the telemonitoring group were given instructions for use of blood pressure (BP), blood glucose and weight monitors which used Bluetooth technology to transmit readings via a supplied modem to a remote secure server.

Participants were asked to measure one fasting and one non-fasting blood glucose at least twice weekly and measure BP and weight at least weekly (with increased testing as recommended by the clinician for people treated with insulin). They were given advice on lifestyle modification, on lag time for effects of lifestyle and medication change on glucose and BP, and when and how to contact their healthcare advisor.

The study received ethical approval from the South East Scotland Ethics Service (10/S1102/60) and R&#x00026;D approvals from the Scottish Health Boards and the Research Management and Governance (RM&#x00026;G) Consortium for Kent and Medway. This qualitative study took place in Lothian and Kent. Patients were made aware that they may be approached for the embedded qualitative study when they agreed to participate in the trial, but that participation in the qualitative study would be optional. Patients and professionals approached were sent a separate information sheet about the qualitative study and gave additional written consent prior to participation.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Sampling and recruitment</title><p>Forty-two GP practices and 321 patients participated in the RCT. A maximum variation patient sample of at least 20 patients from the intervention arm from 12 of these practices in Lothian and Kent (where the majority of participating practices were located) was sought based on age, sex and the deprivation status of the practice. Patients participating in the trial were purposively sampled and checks were made with the practice to ensure that it was still appropriate to approach the patient before they were contacted by letter. Those who did not respond were replaced by patients taking part in the trial with similar characteristics. The aim of this sampling strategy was to capture a broad range of participant experiences across the socioeconomic spectrum. Interviews were also sought with at least one professional from each practice.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Data generation</title><p>Qualitative data were gathered through semistructured interviews with patients, nurses and doctors. Initial topic guides were based on issues identified in previous telemonitoring studies and were refined iteratively in response to the initial interviews. The final topic guides are shown in online supplementary appendix 1. Some participants from Lothian were interviewed face-to-face in their own home, and professionals at their workplace, with all other interviews carried out by telephone. Interviews were carried out by PF, a male qualitative researcher who was not involved in the RCT.</p></sec><sec id="s2e"><title>Data handling and analysis</title><p>Data were collected between July 2011 and March 2012 and, with a little variation due to availability, in tranches reflecting different start dates of the trial in different practices. Provisional coding and identification of themes took place after each tranche of interviews. Interviewing continued until the researcher, in discussion with the wider research team, considered that data saturation had been achieved. Although there is discussion on the concept of data saturation,<xref rid="R39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref> in the context of this study it was considered to have occurred when the researcher was not identifying any new themes or codes within the provisional themes in sequential interviews and thought this would be unlikely in subsequent interviews.</p><p>All interviews were recorded, fully transcribed and the transcript checked against the recording. They were analysed thematically with initial codes and themes identified inductively from the data. Patient and professional data were initially coded separately and coding was recorded using Nvivo V.7. Initial codes from patients and professionals were grouped into themes and a framework of overarching themes developed, in line with the interpretive descriptive approach, with reference to the purpose of this study. A range of strategies was employed to ensure that the analysis was credible and trustworthy. Constant comparison was used to ensure consistency in coding and negative cases were sought for each coding category. Coding was checked and iteratively refined using paired analysis of transcripts by two researchers (PF and JH). Researcher reflexivity was supported by discussing emerging findings at regular meetings with the wider research group where different explanations were explored and the coding and thematic analysis reviewed and refined. In July 2012, the thematic analysis was presented by PF to a discussion group of researchers who had participated in the Telescot programme. The presentation introduced the themes and illustrative quotes and the whole data set (all the text associated with each code) was made available to the participants.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="s3"><title>Results</title><p>Thirty-six patient participants were approached and 23 interviewed, 16 men and 7 women, mean age 60&#x02005;years.

The data generated by telemonitoring supported self-care decisions and medical treatment decisions. In terms of self-care, the motivation to manage diet (the preferred method of improving diabetic control) was not just due to the patient seeing high blood glucose measurements, but also because the measurements may be seen within the practice, and patients considered the benign policing aspect of telemonitoring to be important. A similar finding was reported in a recently published study from New Zealand.<xref rid="R40" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> The convenience of telemonitoring was very acceptable to patients although professionals had some concerns about telemonitoring increasing workload and costs. The findings indicated that there was a lack of consensus on who (patient or practitioner) should initiate communication if readings were outwith the target range and the mode of communication, with telephone and letter being used but some practitioners preferring to see patients face to face.</p><p>A strength of this study is that it was embedded in an RCT, (the results of which will be published elsewhere). Qualitative studies nested within clinical trials of complex interventions can identify how the intervention was applied and the mechanism by which it induces change,<xref rid="R41" ref-type="bibr">41</xref> particularly useful in trials such as this where guidelines rather than a strict protocol for the use of the telehealth intervention within the practices were issued.<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> The results can be used to improve future guidance and iterations of the technology. Also professionals in particular welcomed the chance to test the new technology with no commitment to continue, and it may have been used by practices who would not otherwise have been &#x02018;early adopters&#x02019;. According to the diffusion of innovations theory,<xref rid="R42" ref-type="bibr">42</xref> the trialability of an innovation is one of the properties which affects the chances of it being adopted, and in the trial context the technology was easy for practices to try on a small scale.</p><p>However, the trial context is also a weakness of the study, since the lack of full scale commitment to telemonitoring within a practice means that professionals did not experience providing the service at the scale required should it be adopted as routine care, and it is clear that large numbers of successful telehealth pilots have failed to translate into routine service.<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> In addition participants in RCTs are often not representative of the wider population of people with diabetes. The participation rate in the Telescot diabetes trial was only 12% and there was over representation of men and younger people and under-representation of more socioeconomically deprived populations compared to the distributions among people with diabetes in the general population (S Wild, The impact of supported telemetric monitoring in people with type 2 diabetes, personal communication). Also Lothian and Kent have non-Caucasian ethnic minority populations of only 4% and 5%, respectively<xref rid="R43" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>
<xref rid="R44" ref-type="bibr">44</xref> and, although the ethnic mix of participants in the trial and this qualitative study was representative of the local populations, this study could not provide insight into the acceptability of telemonitoring for these groups who are at higher risk of type 2 diabetes.</p><p>The results of the Telescot programme of qualitative studies of telemonitoring<xref rid="R27" ref-type="bibr">27&#x02013;33</xref> show a number of common themes. Where this study differed is in the strong self-management response. Type 2 diabetes is the only condition which patients said that they expected to self-manage on a day-to-day basis even though over the long term it was difficult to maintain motivation. As well as supporting self-care, the telemonitoring data supported optimisation of treatment, particularly in relation to BP. Patients found telemonitoring a convenient way to communicate with healthcare professionals. However, some professional responses were more wary and suggest a lack of &#x02018;fit&#x02019; between telemonitoring and current expectations of professional practice which may limit translation into routine practice.<xref rid="R45" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> Other studies have suggested that much more attention needs to be paid to workflow within practices when designing telehealth systems which will be acceptable on a long-term basis.<xref rid="R33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>
<xref rid="R46" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Despite this, there was evidence that some professionals were willing to change BP medication without seeing the patient face to face, although for others that remained the only mode of communication.</p></sec><sec id="s4a"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Telemonitoring in type 2 diabetes was well accepted by trial participants and increased motivation to improve self-management. It also provided clinicians with a quantitative basis on which to improve the medical management of BP. Some professionals harboured concerns about the potential for the service to increase workload and cost and some expressed a reluctance to move away from traditional exclusive face to face care, but this was not universal. There is need for further refinement of telehealthcare delivery models and technical improvements in telemonitoring systems, as well as wider cultural change on the part of patients and clinicians. More evidence of the beneficial effects of these interventions on patients' self-care motivation and behaviour may help to encourage clinicians to adopt these technologies in routine practice.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the practices and patients who participated in the study.
