One of such gift is dyslipidemia which is a potential signal for unrecognized comorbidities such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease etc.[<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] It may be manifested by elevation of the total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) and triglyceride (TGL) concentrations and a decrease in the good high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentration in the blood.</p><p>The prevalence of dyslipidemia in India is not exactly known as it usually appears as subclinical case without symptoms. For every 1% increase in cholesterol level, there is 1&#x02013;2% increase in the incidence of coronary heart disease. According to the National Commission on Macroeconomics and Health, there would be around 62 million patients with coronary artery disease by 2015 in India and of these, 23 million would be patients younger than 40 years of age.[<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]</p><p>Statins are the first choice in the treatment of dyslipidemia.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] The data from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey conducted from 1999 to 2000 reported that 25% of adults either had total cholesterol &#x0003e;239.4 mg/dl or were taking a lipid-lowering medication. Lifestyle modifications should always be a part of the management of dyslipidemia. However, the need for long-term, lifelong therapy is associated with several adverse effects such as myopathy, increased risk of renal failure, hypothyroidism and memory loss in 15%-20% of the patients on treatment with statins.</p><p>There are scattered references available in Ayurveda which can be correlated to dyslipidemia. Lipids can be easily correlated to that of <italic>Medo Dhatu</italic>.

The progression from a physiology to pathology is so prompt that it cannot be pointed out distinctly.</p><p>A review of the <italic>Laghutrayi</italic> bears certain references to dyslipidemia. <italic>Adhamalla</italic>, commentator of <italic>Sharangdhara Samhita</italic> has differentiated between the two types of <italic>Medo Roga</italic> namely <italic>Sthaulya</italic> and <italic>Medo Dosha</italic>.[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]</p><p>The better result in reducing the cholesterol level obtained by <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> can be explained in two ways: <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> being the best treatment for <italic>Pitta Dosha</italic> through which large amount of bile is excreted which indirectly helps in the excretion of cholesterol. Apart from this, the site of action is on <italic>Adho Amashaya</italic> (small intestine) from where the cholesterol is reabsorbed. Thus <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> helps to convert the cholesterol in the non-absorbable form so that it may not be reabsorbed.</p><p>On the other side, <italic>Yakrit</italic> (liver) being the main organ of <italic>Pitta Sthana</italic>, <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> may be having a direct effect on the functioning of liver. Once the functioning of liver is corrected, the synthesis of cholesterol may be checked and excretion of cholesterol may be increased by stimulating the bile production and secretion.</p><p>In <italic>Virechana Karma</italic>, injurious substances are brought from the peripheral tissues to the intestine by adopting proper <italic>Snehana</italic> (oleation) and <italic>Svedana</italic> (sudation). This means the cholesterol present at the plasma and tissue level might have been brought to the intestine for the excretion by therapeutic purgation.</p><p>Comparative better effect on triglycerides (TGL) by <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> could be attributed by the following reasons. The main action of <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> is on <italic>Pitta Dosha</italic>, indirectly on <italic>Agni</italic> which plays an important role in the digestion and metabolism through which the synthesis of triglycerides might have been regulated. It has also action on <italic>Koshtha</italic> (small intestine) from where the raw materials for the synthesis of TGL will be absorbed. Hence, regulating the functions of intestine may regulate the uptake and absorption of raw materials for TGL.</p><p>The liver plays a major role in the synthesis and storage of TGL. <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> is the major treatment for <italic>Pitta Dosha</italic> and <italic>Pitta Sthana</italic>. Liver being one of the major <italic>Pitta Sthana</italic>, <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> significantly improve the function of liver which indirectly regulates the synthesis of TGL.</p><p>The improvement in the HDL level had occurred as <italic>Virechana Karma</italic> mainly works on <italic>Agni, Pitta Sthana</italic> (liver)and <italic>Koshtha</italic>, i.e., intestine which helped for the proper formation of <italic>Dhatu</italic>, i.e., tissues in general and quality of the tissues in particular. Further, in LDL and VLDL level also much better result was observed. As <italic>Virechana</italic> improves <italic>Agni</italic>, it regulates the intake of raw material for the production of lipids. It also improves the functioning of liver there by regulates the endogenous production of VLDL.</p><p>In the present study, a modified <italic>Kala Basti</italic> schedule was adopted, in order to have maximum <italic>Lekhana</italic> effect, more number of <italic>Niruha Basti</italic> and less number of <italic>Anuvasana Basti</italic> were administered as per the <italic>Kala Basti</italic> schedule.</p><p>The effect of <italic>Lekhana Basti</italic> on serum cholesterol can be studied under two headings:</p><sec id="sec2-7"><title>Action at the level of liver</title><p>The chief drugs of <italic>Lekhana Basti</italic> like honey, <italic>Triphala, Gomutra, Yavakshara and Ooshakadi Gana Dravya</italic> are having <italic>Kaphahara, Medohara</italic> activity which might have been absorbed by the superior haemorrhoidal veins and evacuated directly to the liver, there by correcting liver metabolism. This might have reduced the synthesis of cholesterol by increasing its excretion. The two-third portion directly enters systemic circulation through inferior and middle haemorrhoidal veins resulting in significant availability of drugs by bypassing the metabolism which may be the cause in reduction in serum level.</p></sec><sec id="sec2-8"><title>Correcting <italic>Vata Dosha</italic></title><p>The corner stone in the treatment of reducing cholesterol is inhibition of acetyl Co-A reductase which may be considered as a part of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic>. <italic>Basti Karma</italic> regulates the production and function of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> also.</p><p>The effect obtained by <italic>Lekhana Basti</italic> in serum triglyceride may be due to the following reasons. The drugs used in <italic>Basti Karma</italic> are mainly <italic>Medohara</italic> (hypolipidemic)and <italic>Lekhana</italic> in nature; hence they might have reduced the level of TGL. Apart from this, the basic causative factor for dyslipidemia (<italic>Medoroga</italic>) is the abnormal movement of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> which in turn increases the appetite there by resulting in increased calorie intake. Hence to reduce the calorie intake the main treatment could be regulating the movement of <italic>Vata Dosha</italic> which was achieved by successful administration of <italic>Basti.</italic></p><p>The improvement in the serum HDL level after the <italic>Basti</italic> was observed. As <italic>Lekhana Basti</italic> drugs are having <italic>Medohara</italic> action, it cleanses the channels of transportation there by eliminates the accumulated <italic>Dosha</italic> and <italic>Malarupi Medo Dhatu</italic> which may be the reason for the reduction of serum LDL and VLDL level.</p><p>Atorvastatin calcium is a synthetic lipid-lowering agent and is an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase leads to upregulation of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) receptors in the liver, mediated by activation of sterol regulatory element binding proteins resulting in enhanced clearance of LDL from the circulation, thus playing an important role in lowering the lipid profile.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="conclusion" id="sec1-5"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Dyslipidemia is the abnormal amount of lipids in the blood due to impaired lipid metabolism and can be correlated with abnormal <italic>Medo Dhatu</italic> (<italic>Medo Dosha</italic>).
