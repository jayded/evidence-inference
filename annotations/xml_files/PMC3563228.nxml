Identifying characteristics associated with successful quitting by actively recruited smokers could help to distinguish those most likely to benefit from proactive telephone counselling. This study assessed the baseline characteristics of actively recruited smokers associated with prolonged abstinence at 4, 7 and 13 months and the proportion achieving prolonged abstinence that would miss out on proactive telephone counselling if such support was offered only to smokers intending to quit within 30 days at baseline.</p></sec><sec><title>Design</title><p>Secondary analysis of a randomized controlled trial in which the baseline characteristics associated with prolonged abstinence were examined.</p></sec><sec><title>Setting</title><p>New South Wales (NSW) community, Australia.</p></sec><sec><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 1562 smokers recruited at random from the electronic NSW telephone directory.</p></sec><sec><title>Measurements</title><p>Baseline socio-demographic and smoking-related characteristics associated with prolonged abstinence at 4, 7 and 13 months post-recruitment.</p></sec><sec><title>Findings</title><p>Waiting more than an hour to smoke after waking and intention to quit within 30 days at baseline predicted five of the six prolonged abstinence measures. If proactive telephone counselling was restricted to smokers who at baseline intended to quit within 30 days, 53.8&#x02013;65.9% of experimental group participants who achieved prolonged abstinence would miss out on telephone support.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>Less addicted and more motivated smokers who are actively recruited to quitline support are more likely to achieve abstinence. Most actively recruited smokers reported no intention to quit within the next 30 days, but such smokers still achieved long-term abstinence.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Active recruitment</kwd><kwd>predictors</kwd><kwd>quitline</kwd><kwd>randomized controlled trial</kwd><kwd>smoking cessation</kwd><kwd>telephone counseling</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Quitline services offer proactive telephone counselling (i.e. quitline-initiated calls to smokers) and/or reactive telephone counselling (i.e. immediate counselling to smoker-initiated calls) to assist smokers to quit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b1">1</xref>.

Households were mailed an information letter and telephoned. Of 43 710 households reached, 3008 contained an eligible smoker. One smoker was selected randomly, and if he/she gave verbal consent completed a baseline computer-assisted telephone interview (CATI, <italic>n</italic> = 1562). Subsequently, the CATI randomly allocated the smoker to proactive telephone counselling (<italic>n</italic> = 769) or self-help materials (<italic>n</italic> = 793). CATIs were conducted at 4 months (<italic>n</italic> = 1369), 7 months (<italic>n</italic> = 1278) and 13 months (<italic>n</italic> = 1245) to assess cessation.

However, for these secondary analyses, some non-significant findings may be due to limited power rather than no real difference existing. For example, in the comparison of those taking 31&#x02013;60 minutes to smoke after waking with those taking 1&#x02013;30 minutes the study had less than 50% power to find a doubling of the quit rate for 3-month prolonged abstinence from 2.5 to 5%.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analysis was completed using SAS software. &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> tests investigated whether baseline characteristics were associated with prolonged abstinence at 4, 7 or 13 months. Variables significant at <italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; 0.25 in the univariate analysis were included in a backward stepwise logistic regression model. Non-significant variables were removed until variables were significant at &#x003b1; = 0.05. Collinearity among baseline variables was not controlled for in logistic regressions because Spearman's correlation coefficient was less than 0.5 for all pairwise correlations of dichotomous and ordinal baseline variables. The pseudo <italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> determined the variance accounted for in each logistic regression model and the Hosmer &#x00026; Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test assessed whether the model

We also found that if proactive telephone counselling were offered only to smokers who intended to quit within 30 days, then 53.8&#x02013;65.9% of experimental group participants who achieved prolonged abstinence would miss out on telephone support.</p><p>The study strengths included that all smokers irrespective of quitting intention were eligible and retention rates at follow-ups were high. These features increase the generalizability of the findings to the general smoking population. Study shortcomings included that limited power for secondary analyses may have contributed to non-significant findings for some baseline characteristics. Furthermore, the reliability of the percentages of quitters who would miss out on proactive telephone counselling if support were offered only to those intending to quit within 30 days was limited by small samples. Biochemical validation of self-reported cessation was not conducted; however, it is considered unnecessary for such trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b15">15</xref>.</p><p>Our 7-month findings are similar to a trial with quitline callers that reported that greater readiness to quit was associated with 3-month prolonged abstinence at 6 months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b10">10</xref>. However, unlike the prior study, we found that intention to quit also predicted prolonged abstinence longer-term. A cohort study of smokers recruited from community health centres into proactive telephone support found that less addiction predicted prolonged abstinence at 30 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b16">16</xref>. We found an association between nicotine dependence and prolonged abstinence also existed at 4, 7 and 13 months.</p><p>Longer time to first cigarette after waking (a validated measure of nicotine dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b17">17</xref>) was critical in determining whether actively recruited smokers achieved prolonged abstinence. Quitline advisers should therefore assess actively recruited smokers&#x02019; nicotine dependence and tailor advice accordingly; for example, by encouraging use of pharmacotherapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b18">18</xref>. Despite more than 70% of actively recruited smokers reporting no intention to quit within the next 30 days at baseline <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="b12">12</xref>, such smokers still achieved long-term abstinence.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This project was undertaken by the Centre for Health Research &#x00026; Psycho-oncology (CHeRP) and Hunter New England Population Health (HNEPH).
