This study aimed to assess the effects of <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> flower and <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> leaves essential oils inhalation in two different groups of athlete male students on their exercise performance and lung function.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Twenty physical education students volunteered to participate in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned into two groups: <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> and <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> (ten participants each). One group was nebulized by <italic>Citrus sinensis</italic> flower oil and the other by <italic>Mentha spicata</italic> leaves oil in a concentration of (0.02&#x000a0;ml/kg of body mass) which was mixed with 2&#x000a0;ml of normal saline for 5&#x000a0;min before a 1500&#x000a0;m running tests.

The natural plant&#x02019;s essential oils are widely used in medicine and pharmacy for many purposes due to their evidence based physiological and psychological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>]. They are also considered one of the most important branches of Complementary and Alternative Medicine, which is called aromatherapy that focuses on the usage of essential oils for the treatment of various illnesses by using natural essential oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Essential oils can cleanse cellular receptor sites of medications, petrochemicals and other disruptors of intercellular communication and can chelate heavy metals and other toxins, helping to remove and flush them through the kidneys, lungs, sweat, colon and liver. In fact, they increase the body&#x02019;s ability to absorb nutrients and vitamins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, many of the essential oils are used in the pharmaceutical industry as an active ingredient in the pharmaceutical formulations such as Eucalyptus, Peppermint, Thyme, Anise, Fennel oils and many others or they are used in the pharmaceutical industry as excipients as well as most of the flavoring agents which are used to improve the odor and taste of drugs that are isolated from various plants containing essential oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>].</p><p>In the last thirty years, a series of studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of essential oils smelling on the behaviors, creativity, mood and many other psychological and physiological effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].

The spirometer is used to differentiate between obstructive and restrictive diseases and assess the degree of associated changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>]. Such parameters include Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second (FEV1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC).

Clevenger apparatus with a 1&#x000a0;L round-bottom flask containing 100&#x000a0;g of <italic>M. spicata</italic> leaves was placed inside the microwave oven. About 500&#x000a0;ml distilled water was then added into the flask containing the powder. The flask was then connected to Clevenger apparatus.

The obtained volatile oil was collected into a clean beaker and chemically dried then the purified essential oil was weighed and stored in tightly-closed amber-colored bottles at &#x02212;4&#x000a0;&#x000b0;C in the refrigerator. The same procedure was repeated for extraction of <italic>C. sinensis</italic> essential oil flowers.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Subjects and study design</title><p>Twenty male university students from the faculty of physical education at An-Najah National University in Nablus-Palestine volunteered and were randomly assigned into two different groups (10 participants each) to take part in the experiments using a non-randomized quasi-experimental uncontrolled before-and-after study design for each group. The study was single blind at the level of participants. One group (10 students) was nebulized with <italic>M. spicata</italic> oil, while the other group (10 students) was nebulized with <italic>C. sinensis</italic> flowers oil (0.02&#x000a0;ml/kg of body mass of each oil) mixed with 2&#x000a0;ml of normal saline 5&#x000a0;min before a 1500&#x000a0;m running test according to the method validated by Spencer and Gastin, 2001. Traditionally, it was thought that in the middle distance track running the relative energy system was 75&#x000a0;% aerobic and 22&#x000a0;% anaerobic and a 2&#x02013;3&#x000a0;% of the energy coming from the creatine-phosphate system. But recently, the aerobic energy system contributes significantly to the energy supply during middle distance running and long sprint event. Moreover, the relative anaerobic and aerobic system contributions of the four events (200&#x000a0;m, 400&#x000a0;m, 800&#x000a0;m, and 1500&#x000a0;m). In the middle distance running such as 1500&#x000a0;m event depends on the aerobic 84&#x000a0;% and anaerobic energy system which is greater than it was traditionally thought, so during this event the need of oxygen increases with the event duration from 200 to 1500&#x000a0;m running race [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>].</p><p>Moreover, the 1500&#x000a0;m distance was required to ensure the duration of effect of the oils (if any) as inhaled route of administration and the greater distances could have been taken into consideration if the interventions were given orally or by another route of administration, however, our estimation was that this distance could be representable of such route of administration given at the same time that the same group conducted the running pre and post intervention.</p><p>A washout period of three days (from Sunday to Wednesday) between pre and after test for each group was given to rule out any fatigue or significant impact on our results pre and post test. Lung function tests were measured using a spirometer for each student pre and post nebulization. The study was carried out in May, 2016.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Methodology</title><p>The subjects were familiarized with the spirometry. Lung function tests were measured using a spirometer for each student pre and post inhalations with <italic>M. spicata</italic> and <italic>C. sinensis</italic> oils. The specificity and sensitivity of spirometer in diagnosis of obstructive lung disease are reported as 84 and 92&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>]. While in the diagnosis of restrictive lung disease, it has a sensitivity and specificity of 42.2 and 94.3&#x000a0;%, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR41">41</xref>]. FEV1 is the maximum air volume exhaled with maximal effort in the first second from a position of full inspiration. This value declines less severely with restrictive diseases than obstructive diseases. FVC, on the other hand, is the maximal air volume exhaled with maximal effort from a position of full inspiration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>], and is reduced by an airflow obstruction and ventilation restriction, which results from lung-exterior factors such as skeletal pains or intrinsic lung disease, especially restrictive ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>]. In the latter, there is a decline in the lung compliance associated with the presence of partial or diffuse lung fibrosis. These fibrotic changes render the lung smaller and stiffer, leading to a decrease in the FVC. The FEV1/FVC ratio is reduced in obstructive patterns, but it is normal or even increased in restrictive patterns as both nominator and denominator proportionally change.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Data collection form</title><p>Different sections were included.

Then, spirometry was performed using a Spirometer apparatus. Regular guidelines for spirometer testing were followed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>]. The subjects were seated during the test, with the nose clipped to prevent air leakage through the nares. Three attempts for each subject were allowed, and the best Spirograph was selected automatically by the spirometer. Forced spirometry was measured for each subject.

Furthermore, the running times for each group were significantly decreased for both <italic>M. spicata</italic> and <italic>C. sinensis</italic> nebulized groups (<italic>p</italic>-values, 0.007 and 0.005; respectively).</p><p>A scientific Study which was conducted by Saeki and Tanaka, 2005 had approved that an inhaling fragrances had affected the relieving of pricking pain sensation and suppressed autonomic responses and they suggested that aromatherapy may have more palliative effect on chronic rather than pricking pain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR45">45</xref>].</p><p>Studies have shown that inhalations of various species of peppermint were effective in reducing muscle pain and fatigue as well as they had muscle relaxation effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR46">46</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR48">48</xref>].</p><p>Another investigation was conducted by McKenzie and Hedge, 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR49">49</xref>] about the effects of inhalation of peppermint oil on running performance under different conditions. Eighteen young female subjects run 3.25 miles and were divided into groups; wearied a peppermint scented mask group, and unscented mask group. The results showed that peppermint inhalation had significantly lower heart rates during the running task.</p><p>A study of Dede&#x000e7;ay&#x02019;s, 1995 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR50">50</xref>] showed that the aqueous solution containing rosemary and peppermint which was given to French cyclists made muscle relaxation and decreased muscular fatigues.

The use of essential oils in medicine began in the ancient Egyptian Era, and has continued ever since [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR56">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR57">57</xref>]. One of the most popular parts of complementary and alternative medicine is considered to be aromatherapy, which depends only on essential oils utilization for treatment of various diseases and this branch has spread worldwide, despite the lack of scientific basis for the effectiveness of essential oils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR58">58</xref>]. On the other hand, the long history of essential oils usages in medicine and pharmacy suggests that they may indeed be effective.

Most of these studies focused on peppermint plant but unfortunately and according to the best of authors&#x02019; knowledge there were no previous studies about <italic>M. spicata</italic> and <italic>C. sinensis</italic> oils inhalations on the lung function and on the athletic performance.</p><p>Future study is needed to demonstrate oral supplementation of <italic>M. spicata</italic> and <italic>C. sinensis</italic> essential oils to improve athletic performance and post-exercise recovery; another future objective would be to clarify their mechanism of action and to explain their physiological and pharmacological effects.</p><sec id="Sec14"><title>Study limitations</title><p>This study could have some limitations. The absent of control groups is one of the limitations. However, no control groups have been proposed in order to ensure that the intervention reaches the maximum number of students agreed to participate. In addition, in the design could also be another source of limitations in this study. Indeed, we conduct a non-randomized quasi-experimental uncontrolled before-and-after study. However, we are aware that in this design secular trends or sudden changes make it difficult to attribute observed changes to the intervention. Further limitations of this design could be that the occurrence of over-estimation of the effects of intervention. Interestingly enough, by using this design we were able to measure performance before and after the introduction of intervention in the same study group and the observed differences in performance were assumed to be due to the intervention. This study design has the advantages of that it is relatively simple to conduct and participants are having same characteristics pre-and post test and it is a design superior to observational studies. Furthermore, due to lack of resources and difficulty of circumstances in our country and university we found this the most robust design possible to minimize bias and maximize generalisability.</p><p>Regarding the small sample size which could have affected the study statistical power, we are fully aware of this limitation but we were not be able to recruit more due to voluntary participation. Therefore, we found it fairly enough to divide the 20 students ten by ten in each group in order to run this study. We also did not conduct between group changes as we did not aim to perform comparison between the two groups with the different oils intervention but we only aimed to assess the outcome for each intervention in the same group pre-and post test.</p><p>As we have indicated above, we used a quasi-experimental uncontrolled before-and-after study design and we did not aim to compare between groups, therefore, differences in smoking or any other variations between groups were not taken into consideration in the analysis as we have measured the changes for each intervention separately among the same group pre- and post test.</p><p>There was no dietary control in this study. However, we believe that those are informative groups of students who might have same weekly dietary intake level and we asked them to restrict any energy stimulator intakes during the week of the study. Therefore, dietary intake could have minimal effects on our findings.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec15"><title>Conclusions</title><p>To our knowledge, this is the first study that explored the effect of inhalation of <italic>M. spicata</italic> and <italic>C. sinensis</italic> essential oils on exercise performance and lung function. Our findings support the effectiveness of <italic>M. spicata</italic> and <italic>C. sinensis</italic> essential oils on the exercise performance and respiratory function parameters. However, our conclusion and generalisability of our results should be interpreted with caution due to small sample size and lack of control groups, randomization or masking. No control groups have been proposed in order to ensure that the intervention reaches the maximum number of students agreed to participate. We recommend further investigations to explain the mechanism of actions for these two essential oils on exercise performance and respiratory gas exchange parameters. Differences in running distance, duration of study and inhalation of two different unstudied before essential oils instead of inhalation of peppermint aroma could be the important characteristics of this study compared to previous researches.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term><italic>C. sinensis</italic></term><def><p><italic>Citrus sinensis</italic></p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FEV1</term><def><p>Forced Expiratory Volume in the first second</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>FVC</term><def><p>Forced vital capacity</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>M. spicata</italic></term><def><p><italic>Mentha spicata</italic></p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ack><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge the assistance of the technicians Mohamad Arar and Linda Isa as well as An-Najah National University for its support.</p><sec id="FPar1"><title>Funding</title><p>None.</p></sec><sec id="FPar2"><title>Availability of data and materials</title><p>Data are all contained within the article.</p></sec><sec id="FPar3"><title>Authors&#x02019; contributions</title><p>NJ wrote the manuscript, NJ, HA, BR, AH, JS carried out experiments.
