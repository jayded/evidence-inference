However, the effects of the other doses of magnesium on the hemodynamic responses to laryngoscopy were not investigated before. We designed the present study to compare the effects of different doses of MgSO<sub>4</sub> on suppression of cardiovascular responses to the laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods" id="sec1-2"><title>METHODS</title><p>After obtaining institutional approval from the Ethic Committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences (Isfahan, Iran), this double-blinded randomized controlled study was performed from September 2012 to July 2013.</p><p>We obtained written informed consent from 120 patients aged 18&#x02013;65 years with America Society of Anesthesiologists physical status grades I&#x02013;II, who underwent elective surgery under general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Patients were not included in our study if they had previous history of renal disease, cardiovascular, gastrointestinal or neurological disorders, use of anticoagulant drugs, calcium channel blockers, known allergies to the study drug, and airway malformation. No pregnant patient was included into the study. Furthermore, if there was any change in technique of anesthesia or duration of laryngoscopy for &#x0003e;30 s, the patient was excluded from the study.</p><p>After arriving to the operating room, patients were randomly allocated to one of the four groups (30 patients in each group). Randomization was performed using simple block method. Patients in Groups I, II, and III received intravenous (IV) MgSO<sub>4</sub> (30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg, respectively) over 1 min, while in control group, they received only the equal volume of IV saline 0.09% (Group S). General anesthesia was induced with IV propofol (2 mg/kg), IV fentanyl (3 &#x003bc;g/kg), and atracurium 0.6 mg/kg for facilitation of muscle relaxation. Tracheal intubation was performed after 2 min from injection of atracurium. Anesthesia was continued with 1.25% isoflurane in combination with 50% oxygen in nitric oxide. Morphine 0.1 mg/kg was used for intraoperative analgesia. Ventilation of the lungs was adjusted to maintain an end-tidal CO<sub>2</sub> of 35-40 mmHg. After surgery, IV neostigmine 0.04 mg/kg and atropine 0.02 mg/kg were used to reverse muscle relaxation. The serum level of MgSO<sub>4</sub> was not measured at any time throughout the study.</p><p>Anesthesia was performed by an anesthetist who was not involved in data collection. HR, systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded noninvasively before induction of anesthesia, just before laryngoscopy, and at 1, 3, 5, and 10 min after endotracheal intubation.</p><p>Grade of laryngoscopy was recorded by the use of Cromak&#x02013;Lehane classification:[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] In Grade I, most of the glottic opening can be seen. In Grade II, only the posterior portion of the glottis or only arytenoid cartilages is visible. In Grade III, only the epiglottis but no portion of the glottis is visible and in Grade IV, neither the glottis nor the epiglottis can be seen.</p><p>Duration of laryngoscopy, extubation time, hypotension (SBP &#x0003c;20% of basal), hyper-tension (SBP &#x0003e;20% of basal), tachy-cardia (increased HR &#x0003e;20% of baseline), arrhythmias and changes in ST-T segments (&#x0003e;10 mm depression relative to baseline) were also recorded. Recordation of data was performed by a nurse who was unaware of the study group allocation.</p><p>For sample size estimation, we used MedCalc 9.0 statistical software and determined a sample population of 30 patients in each group needed to ensure 80% statistical power at &#x003b1; =0.05 to detect the 25% difference in MAP at maximum pressor response after intubation, with 0.3 difference in standard deviation (SD). Data are presented as mean &#x000b1; SD or numbers (percentages).

Magnesium competes with calcium for binding to the membrane channels. Hence, magnesium acts as a calcium antagonist and can modify the responses that mediated by calcium. Hence, MgSO<sub>4</sub> blocks release of catecholamine stores and decrease responses to adrenergic stimulations.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref><xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]</p><p>Laurant <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] showed that IV MgSO<sub>4</sub> attenuated the release both catecholamine and vasopressin in mesenteric resistance arteries of spontaneously hypertensive rats.[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]</p><p>Magnesium sulfate is utilized in conditions with catecholamine excess such as tetanus,[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] pheochromocytoma,[<xref rid="ref25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and ST elevation anterior myocardial infarction.[<xref rid="ref26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>] MgSO<sub>4</sub> also directly reduces smooth muscle tonicity and subsequently vascular contraction.[<xref rid="ref27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref><xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] Therefore, MgSO<sub>4</sub> is useful to decrease systemic hypertension, as using for treatment of pregnancy induced hypertension.[<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]</p><p>Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation, two daily common procedures with catecholamine release, are usually performed for general anesthesia[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.[<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] In one study, the authors believed IV use of lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg or MgSO<sub>4</sub> 60 mg/kg before anesthetic induction reduced mean arterial and systolic pressures in the first 2 min after intubation better than lidocaine while the effect of these drugs on HR was not significantly different.[<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]</p><p>James <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] evaluated the effect of IV MgSO<sub>4</sub> on catecholamine release related to tracheal intubation. They compared IV MgSO<sub>4</sub> 60 mg/kg with an equal volume of IV 0.09% sodium chloride both IV over 1 min before laryngoscopy. They recorded plasma concentration of magnesium and catecholamine immediately before, during and after intubation, and also 2 and 5 min after intubation. They demonstrated induction of general anesthesia induced no significant changes in HR while it caused a decrease in SBP and DBP, arterial blood pressure.</p><p>In a similar randomized control trial study, Puri and Batra[<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] appraised the effect of IV MgSO<sub>4</sub> 50 mg/kg on hemodynamics changes after tracheal intubation in patients suffering coronary artery disease scheduled for coronary artery bypass graft. They used MgSO<sub>4</sub> for 19 sedated patients and normal saline 0.05 mL/kg for 17 patients. They showed MgSO<sub>4</sub> effectively prevented the rise in arterial blood pressure associated with endotracheal intubation. In addition, this drug could decrease ST segment changes during laryngoscopy.</p><p>In our study, magnesium attenuated the increase in blood pressure till 5 min after laryngoscopy. The ineffectiveness of magnesium administration for prevention of the rise in blood pressure 10 min after laryngoscopy was probably due to decrease in catecholamine release in this time. After laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation, the catecholamines rises maximally till 5 min and after that its release gradually decrease.[<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]</p><p>Stanbury[<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] showed that MgSO<sub>4</sub> prolongs sinus node recovery time by indirect and direct inhibition on the sinoatrial node. It was shown that magnesium slows HR at rest by blockade of the nictitating membrane of the sympathetic ganglia. Magnesium has a negative chronotropic effect after administration of atropine.[<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] It was probable that stress of laryngoscopy and consequently stimulation of sympathetic nervous system was so large that could not be attenuated by the parasympathetic effect of magnesium on the sinoatrial node at dosage used in our study. It is recommended that future studies with higher dosage of MgSO<sub>4</sub> designs to investigate this issue.</p><p>Magnesium caused vasodilation by sympathetic blockade and inhibition of catecholamine release. IV magnesium administration results in a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. Due to these effects, magnesium inhibited the increase in arterial pressure after laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.[<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]</p><p>In our study, there were no significant ST segment changes during induction and tracheal intubation. This could be due to decrease in afterload and coronary vasodilation produced by magnesium administration.[<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] The effect of magnesium on the coronary and systemic arteries is probably due to its calcium antagonist effect.[<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]</p><p>We did not measure the plasma level of MgSO<sub>4</sub> during the study periods. This is a limitation of our study. We recommend future study in this issue with considering such limitation.</p><p>In conclusion, magnesium administered at dosages of 30 mg/kg, 40 mg/kg, and 50 mg/kg comparably attenuated the increase in arterial pressure changes after laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation without significant effect on the HR changes.</p></sec><sec id="sec1-5"><title>AUTHORS&#x02019; CONTRIBUTION</title><p>MRS has planned the study and finalized it; SB, AH, ND and MRS did the statistical analysis and prepared the first version of manuscript for publish.
