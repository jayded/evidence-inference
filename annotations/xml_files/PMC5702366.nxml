Outside study visits, patients self-administered their study medications according to written instructions provided; on visit days, patients were asked to withhold administration of their medication until instructed to administer it. Proper administration of study treatment was evaluated at study visits, and compliance was assessed at weeks 4 and 8 by review of the dose counter on the ELLIPTA inhaler, or the number of inhalations per day as recorded in the eDiary for the Respimat inhaler. Patients with compliance&#x000a0;less than&#x000a0;80% or&#x000a0;greater than 120% were required to be reeducated on proper dosing.

The results showed a statistically significant increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, FVC, and IC, as well as a higher proportion of trough FEV<sub>1</sub> responders (100&#x000a0;mL or more increase from baseline), with UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO. A significantly greater decrease in rescue medication use was reported with UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO, but other patient-reported outcomes showed similar improvements with both UMEC/VI and TIO/OLO, with no consistent treatment difference detectable across all time periods. Both treatments had similar AE profiles.</p><p id="Par33">Previous studies have indicated a potential efficacy gradient within the LAMA/LABA and LAMA classes. A recent, blinded, head-to-head study showed a significant 53-mL increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> with 62.5&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g UMEC compared with 18&#x000a0;&#x000b5;g TIO&#x000a0; in the ITT population (and 59&#x000a0;mL in the PP population) of patients with moderate-to-severe COPD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>], and indirect comparisons suggest that differences in efficacy may be present among LAMA/LABA combination therapies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A systematic review by Calzetta et al. [<xref rid="CR16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] showed an efficacy gradient ranging from 46 to 95&#x000a0;mL in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> when comparing LAMA/LABAs with their monocomponents in patients with stable COPD. The smallest efficacy difference was observed with twice-daily administration of aclidinium/formoterol and the greatest difference was seen with once-daily administration of UMEC/VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. A network meta-analysis by Schlueter et al. [<xref rid="CR17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>] also reported a statistically significant increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> with UMEC/VI compared with twice-daily administration of aclidinium/formoterol, as well as a nonsignificant trend favoring UMEC/VI over TIO/OLO. A more recent and larger indirect Bayesian network meta-analysis by Sion et al. [<xref rid="CR18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] reported a statistically significant increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> with UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO at 12&#x000a0;weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Significant increases in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at 24&#x000a0;weeks favoring UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO were also observed in patients with moderate airflow limitation or those not receiving ICS therapy (45&#x02013;59&#x000a0;mL). The 52-mL increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> with UMEC/VI versus TIO/OLO observed in this study supports these earlier analyses, and confirms an efficacy gradient exists within the LAMA/LABA class with respect to lung function (UMEC/VI&#x000a0;&#x0003e;&#x000a0;TIO/OLO). This is additional to the 60-mL increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> reported with TIO/OLO compared with TIO at 24&#x000a0;weeks in the TOnado 1 and TOnado 2 pivotal trials (71 and 50&#x000a0;mL, respectively) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p id="Par34">Although the minimal clinically meaningful difference from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> is deemed to be 100&#x000a0;mL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>], this was determined on the basis of comparisons of active treatments with placebo. It is possible that smaller differences between active therapies could be associated with changes in symptoms and health status reported by the patient. In this study, the observed significant additional increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> and IC at 8&#x000a0;weeks with UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO was reflected in a significant added benefit in favor of UMEC/VI observed in reduced rescue medication use (puffs per day); however, it was not reflected in other patient-reported outcomes.</p><p id="Par35">In any given COPD population with limited bronchodilator reversibility, potentially modest incremental mean treatment differences are likely when two active therapies are compared. The crossover design of this study not only allowed patients to receive both LAMA/LABA combinations (in a random sequence) to estimate the overall mean incremental efficacy difference in trough FEV<sub>1</sub>, but also allowed the quantification of the number of individual patients who experienced a clinically meaningful (100&#x000a0;mL or more) treatment difference from baseline between the two LAMA/LABA combinations. Patients receiving UMEC/VI had twofold increased odds of experiencing a clinically meaningful increase from baseline in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at both week 4 and week&#x000a0;8 compared with those receiving TIO/OLO. In addition, individual patient responses demonstrated that 52% of patients reported a more than 100-mL better increase with UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO, with only 19% achieving a similar magnitude of benefit in the opposite direction. Achieving this clinically important treatment goal more frequently with UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO is likely to be important in COPD, as it has been shown over longer assessment periods to be associated with a reduced risk of future exacerbations, with a 100-mL increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> from the baseline resulting in an estimated 12&#x02013;21% decrease in exacerbation rates, with a 28&#x02013;30% rate reduction for responders compared with nonresponders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. An improved likelihood of achieving clinically relevant improvements in long-term health status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>] and the potential to prevent longer-term clinically relevant deteriorations in lung function and health status have also been linked to improved bronchodilation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR39">39</xref>]. The increase in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> observed with UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO was also supported by similar observations on other lung volume parameters (FVC and IC) at 4 and 8&#x000a0;weeks. Increases in resting IC suggest a beneficial effect on static lung hyperinflation, an important aspect of COPD that is associated with increased dyspnea and a reduced ability to perform activities of daily living [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR40">40</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR42">42</xref>]. Although dyspnea was not directly assessed in this study, other bronchodilator studies have shown associations between similar improvements in lung function and volumes and reductions in breathlessness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR43">43</xref>].</p><p id="Par36">The benefits of aiming for maximal bronchodilation must always be balanced against the increased potential for AEs and SAEs. In this study, the greater improvements in lung function seen with UMEC/VI compared with TIO/OLO were not at the expense of any increase in AE reporting. Indeed, both treatment regimens were well tolerated, with similar safety profiles. As a recent network meta-analysis by Oba et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR44">44</xref>] has also reported that the LAMA/LABA class is as well tolerated as LAMA monotherapy, and similar findings have been reported in randomized controlled trials of UMEC/VI compared with TIO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>], these findings are reassuring.</p><p id="Par37">In this study, the inclusion of highly symptomatic patients with a modified Medical Research Council Dyspnoea Scale score&#x000a0;of 2 or greater and a postbronchodilator FEV<sub>1</sub> of 50&#x02013;70% of the predicted value [Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) stage 2] focused the study on patients appropriate for early use of dual bronchodilator therapy who were more likely to be responsive to treatment, thereby facilitating better detection of within-class efficacy differences. Likewise, the exclusion of concomitant ICS treatment, in line with the current GOLD treatment paradigm favoring LAMA/LABA use before the addition of ICS therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>], also limited confounding of the maximum bronchodilator response, providing greater capacity to detect within-class efficacy differences. These factors support the robustness of the findings, and should be considered in future comparative studies of LAMA/LABA treatments.</p><p id="Par38">The limitations of this study include those associated with the study design, such as the open-label administration of treatments, no placebo arm, and the potentially short 8-week study duration. Open-label treatment has the potential to introduce bias, particularly in subjective patient-reported efficacy assessments, but it was not possible to source placebo Respimat inhalers from Boehringer Ingelheim to allow a double-blind, double-dummy study to be performed. However, to mitigate any potential for bias on the objectively assessed primary outcome measure, the technicians performing spirometry were blinded to treatment allocation within each study period. It is also notable that the magnitude of the treatment difference for the primary end point was fully in line with expectations seen from indirect treatment comparisons of double-blind trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. The 8-week study duration was sufficient to allow robust assessments of bronchodilator response, with a plateau in the responses detected after 4&#x000a0;weeks with both treatments. However, it could be argued that the study duration was too short to assess differences in longer-term outcomes such as the rate of exacerbations and changes in quality of life over time. Nevertheless, given the comparison in this study is between two bronchodilators, clinically meaningful increases in trough FEV<sub>1</sub> in the first 8&#x000a0;weeks, twofold increased odds of achieving a clinically meaningful level of response, and the reported impact of this level of response on future reductions in annual exacerbation rates suggest the potential for longer-term efficacy differences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec15" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p id="Par39">In this first direct comparison of the once-daily fixed-dose LAMA/LABA combinations UMEC/VI and TIO/OLO, superiority was observed with UMEC/VI for the primary end point of trough FEV<sub>1</sub> at week 8 in patients with symptomatic COPD. This finding confirms the results of previous indirect LAMA/LABA comparisons, and shows that an efficacy gradient exists within the LAMA/LABA class.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Electronic Supplementary Material</title><sec id="Sec16"><p>Below is the link to the electronic supplementary material.
