In brief, SPRING-2 (<italic>N</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;822) compared DTG to raltegravir (RAL), SINGLE (<italic>N</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;833) compared DTG + ABC/3TC to efavirenz (EFV)/TDF/FTC, and FLAMINGO (<italic>N</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;484) compared DTG to darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r). SPRING-2 and FLAMINGO used investigator-selected nucleosides (ABC/3TC or TDF/FTC). SPRING-2 and SINGLE were double-blind studies, and virologic failure was defined as confirmed HIV-1 RNA at least 50&#x0200a;copies/ml on or after week 24; FLAMINGO was open-label and its threshold for virologic failure was plasma HIV-1 RNA above 200&#x0200a;copies/ml.</p><p>The primary endpoint for each study was the proportion of individuals with plasma HIV-1 RNA below 50&#x0200a;copies/ml at week 48, as codified by the Food and Drug Administration snapshot algorithm [<xref rid="R10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>].</p><p>Each study also examined time to treatment or to efficacy-related discontinuation or failure (TRDF and ERDF). The TRDF analysis calculated the time to protocol-defined virologic failure or discontinuation at any time for treatment-related reasons, such as drug-related adverse events, protocol-defined safety stopping criteria, or lack of efficacy. Participants who discontinued for reasons unrelated to treatment were censored at the time of discontinuation. In the ERDF analysis, censoring applied to discontinuations for reasons unrelated to efficacy. Analyses of these secondary endpoints allowed us to assess the impact of each risk factor on the three constituents of the snapshot response (virologic response, tolerability, and administrative dropout).</p><p>We examined consistency of primary endpoint treatment differences within each study according to baseline HIV-1 viral load and NRTI backbone, CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count, sex, baseline age (&#x0003c;36 or &#x02265;36 years), and race (white or African American/African heritage). We explored the impact of subgroups in a pooled dataset using multivariate binomial regression. For any factor associated with prognosis, we also used the regression model to test whether the effect of DTG was consistent across different levels of that factor.</p><p>Cox regression [<xref rid="R11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] was used to explore the effect of each factor on time to TRDF or ERDF.</p><p>All regression models were chosen using stepwise selection with Akaike's information criterion (AIC) [<xref rid="R12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>].</p></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The analysis included data for all 2139 participants from the primary analyses of the individual studies.

For example, in the SPRING-2 study, response rates for DTG and RAL were similar overall, as well as in both men and women; in the SINGLE study, the treatment difference favored DTG overall, as well as in both men and women.</p><p>The only notable case of inconsistency in treatment effects across subgroups was in the subgroup of participants in the FLAMINGO study with high viral load at baseline (<italic>n</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;61 in each arm). In this subgroup, there was a particularly pronounced treatment difference. This was driven both by a higher response rate for those receiving DTG within this study subgroup (compared with the other two trials: 93% versus 83 and 82% in SINGLE and SPRING-2 study, respectively) and a lower response rate for those receiving the comparator (70% receiving DRV/r in FLAMINGO versus 76% receiving EFV/TDF/FTC in SINGLE and 75% receiving RAL in SPRING-2 study). Four participants in the FLAMINGO study experienced ERDF, two of whom had a baseline viral load above100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml: one of these individuals received DTG and the other received DRV/r.</p><p>Response in subgroups defined by sex or race should be interpreted with caution due to the small number of participants who were women or non-white. In each of these subgroups, confidence intervals (CIs) around treatment differences were wider than &#x000b1;12 percentage points. A similar caveat applies to the interpretation of the differences seen in small subgroups defined by the combination of NRTI backbone and baseline viral load (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>b).</p><p>Regression analyses of the snapshot response, and time to TRDF and to ERDF used pooled data from all three studies and are presented in Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>. The snapshot regression analyses were consistent with the primary analyses of the studies. These analyses revealed the significant effects of the treatment arm: DTG-treated individuals responded comparably with RAL-treated individuals, but significantly better when compared with DRV/r and EFV-treated individuals. Baseline viral load, CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count, age, race, risk factor, and hepatitis co-infection were also significantly prognostic of response in these multivariate models (Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">2</xref>).</p><p>There was statistically significant evidence of a larger difference between DTG and comparator among participants with a higher viral load. This was attributable to the previously discussed finding in the FLAMINGO study among participants with high baseline viral load. There was no other evidence of inconsistency in snapshot treatment differences across other subgroups.</p><p>Pooled analyses revealed no significant difference in snapshot response between ABC/3TC and TDF/FTC overall (ABC/3TC 86%, TDF/FTC 85%, difference 1.1%, 95% CI &#x02212;1.8, 4.0 percentage points, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.61) or at high viral loads (difference &#x02212;2.5, 95% CI &#x02212;8.9, 3.8 percentage points, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.42).</p><p>Baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA, CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count, third agent (EFV only), and study were associated with time to TRDF. Treatment differences on this endpoint were not consistent across subgroups defined by baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count or HIV-1 RNA (<italic>P</italic> value for interaction &#x0003c;0.05). The Supplemental Digital Content shows Kaplan&#x02013;Meier plots of time to TRDF by treatment and these factors. The difference in TRDF between DTG versus EFV was most pronounced in participants with high baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count and less pronounced in participants with low baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count. There was no suggestion of inconsistency across viral load strata after allowance for the CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count effect.</p><p>There was no significant difference in time to TRDF between the NRTI backbones overall (hazard ratio 0.92, 95% CI 0.57&#x02013;1.49, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.74) or at high (hazard ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.58&#x02013;2.0, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.83) baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA.</p><p>Participants with a baseline HIV-1 RNA above 100&#x0200a;000&#x0200a;copies/ml or a baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count below 200&#x0200a;cells/&#x003bc;l were at significantly greater risk of ERDF over time. Participants in the FLAMINGO study were less likely to experience virologic failure, largely due to the different virologic failure definition in this study. There was no suggestion of inconsistency of third-agent differences in time to ERDF.</p><p>There was no significant difference in the likelihood of ERDF for participants receiving ABC/3TC compared with TDF/FTC overall (hazard ratio 0.90, 95% CI 0.58&#x02013;1.38, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.63) or at high (hazard ratio 0.95, 95% CI 0.55&#x02013;1.65, <italic>P</italic>&#x0200a;=&#x0200a;0.86) baseline HIV-1 RNA.

By pooling data from more than 2000 clinical trial participants in these studies, we provide new and relevant clinical information on the efficacy of DTG across various treatment subgroups, including backbone NRTI.</p><p>The results of these exploratory subgroup analyses support the primary results from the three phase III studies &#x02013; SPRING-2, SINGLE, and FLAMINGO [<xref rid="R6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="R8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>].</p><p>Treatment differences were largely consistent across subgroups. There was no subgroup in which we observed a response rate for DTG that was significantly lower than that of another third agent. Some significant differences in favor of DTG were more pronounced in certain subgroups (e.g. high viral load in FLAMINGO study for the primary endpoint or TRDF for high CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count in SINGLE study) and, by corollary, attenuated in complementary subgroups (low viral load in FLAMINGO study or low CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count in SINGLE study). Since these findings were not observed consistently across studies or across endpoints within studies, they do not alter the overall conclusions about efficacy drawn from the studies. The efficacy of DTG versus standard-of-care comparators at week 48 was consistent in subgroups defined by sex, race, and age.</p><p>There was some variability in response that applied equally across all treatments. The principal prognostic factors for snapshot response (after third agent) were baseline plasma HIV-1 RNA, baseline CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count, age, race, risk factor, and hepatitis co-infection. The effect of the principal factors was not always significant for endpoints that focused on components of the snapshot response. For example, only baseline viral load, CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count, and study were predictive of both the time to TRDF endpoint and the purely virologic time to ERDF endpoint. The third agent was associated with time to TRDF, but not to ERDF.</p><p>Some studies have shown an association between NRTI backbone and probability of virologic response, including individuals with high baseline viral load [<xref rid="R13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. This finding has not been uniformly replicated [<xref rid="R14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The analysis provided herein consisting of pooled data from three studies provides new data comparing ABC/3TC with TDF/FTC. This analysis showed no difference between the two NRTI backbones when coupled with the third agents studied in the SPRING-2, SINGLE, and FLAMINGO studies at low or high viral loads for the primary snapshot endpoint, the TRDF endpoint, and for a pure virologic ERDF endpoint. It is important to note that this comparison was not randomized. Therefore, biases cannot be excluded, in particular, channeling bias, whereby investigator preference for TDF/FTC in individuals with very high viral load could leave the hardest-to-treat participants on that NRTI backbone. However, it is worth noting that analyses of the distribution of baseline viral load by NRTI and viral load subgroup (Fig. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">2</xref>) do not suggest that among participants with high baseline viral loads, the subgroup taking TDF/FTC had a greater proportion of participants with extremely high baseline viral loads than the subgroup taking ABC/3TC.</p><p>The survival analyses presented herein have statistical limitations: the exact time of virologic failure or loss to follow-up is not known precisely; the proportionality of hazards for Cox models cannot be assessed with great power across a number of strata when there are limited failures observed, largely, at a small number of scheduled visits; and the classification of individuals who drop out for reasons unrelated to treatment is problematic. Analyses of the snapshot endpoint share the last problem and ignore the time at which failure occurred. Our statistical models each make different statistical assumptions, but the main findings of this analysis were robust to the methods used.</p><p>In conclusion, the efficacy findings from the individual studies were largely consistent across subgroups, including baseline HIV-1 RNA, CD4<sup>+</sup> cell count, sex, age, and race. Exploratory analyses did not suggest a difference in response between the NRTI backbones used in these studies. DTG is a q.d. integrase inhibitor without the need for pharmacokinetic boosting that can be used effectively in combination with either TDF/FTC or ABC/3TC in a wide variety of HIV-positive individuals for first-line ART.</p></sec><sec><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funding for this work was provided by ViiV Healthcare.
