Factors affecting calcium metabolism in these situations include low dietary intake of calcium, low lighting, increased CO2 levels in the space station environment and finally the most important factor is skeletal unloading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>]. Bone loss and its consequential osteoporosis, is more exaggerated in the lower extremities of out of space voyagers, which point to the unloading as the most important factor of bone loss [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Follow up studies of long duration space flights including early studies of Mir and Skylab missions and recent study of NASA bone summit have shown that bone loss could become up to 15% that was followed by only 6% of bone recovery after 1&#x000a0;year on earth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. These observations lead researchers to address the issue of the space exploration limitation due to osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>].</p><p>Pharmacological interventions to prevent the rate of bone loss in situations of weightlessness are the focus of interest in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. The latest NASA recommendation for preventing the rate of bone loss and hence osteoporosis also included the use of pharmacological interventions in the studies designed for such purposes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Several pharmacologic interventions have been tested in order to prevent or reverse disuse osteopenia. These include the use of antiabsorptive agents like alendronate and anabolic drugs like estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Supplementation of daily diet with vitamins and elements acting on bone including vitamin K and D is another field of interest in preventing disuse osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. These studies demonstrated that vitamin D as contrary to vitamin K does not show promising results in studies involving astronauts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>One of the disadvantages for designing trial studies concerning the improvement in bone mineral density is the rare and expensive settings of trial in out of space or scarce situations mimicking this condition. Therefore, the use of animal models for performing studies mimicking weightlessness is becoming more widespread among researchers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>] in recent years, the use of unloaded rodents as a model of weightlessness that is well known in the literature as hindlimb suspension model is becoming the model of choice for simulating space flight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. The influence of different measures for reducing the detrimental effects of weightlessness on animal bone has been tested by this model till now. These include the study of bisphosphonates, testestrone and vitamin K on bone markers of tail suspended rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. The effect of vitamin D on bone metabolism and bone turn over markers of out of space voyagers is not demonstrated yet; therefore in this article the effect of vitamin D on bone forming biomarkers of hindlimb suspended rats is studied.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Study animals and grouping</title><p>Dawley strain male rats were raised to 6&#x000a0;weeks of age weighing 220&#x02009;&#x000b1;&#x02009;20 grams at Pastour institute laboratory and breeding center (Tehran, Iran). At 7&#x000a0;week of age 19 rats were transferred to animal housing and laboratory affiliated to Iran university of medical sciences (Tehan, Iran).

This technique of unloading was previously used successfully in rats and it has become the method of choice for space flight simulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. It is also shown that animals gain weight during tail suspension indicating less stressful nature of the technique in comparison to other methods like back harness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>].

In this article we have tested the effect of activated vitamin D supplementation on serum calcium and biomarkers of bone formation.

These findings point to ALP, to be a marker of bone formation and surrogate marker of bone loss, all together indicating the need for couscous and proper interpretation of the change in this biomarker.</p><p>Although vitamin D supplementation is documented to cause significant increase in bone mass densitometry and decrease in the risk of bone fracture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR31">31</xref>], the effect of this vitamin on OC that is another biomarker of bone formation is still unclear. Regarding this marker, it is shown that OC is increased after treatment with vitamin D, but this change in OC level was repeatedly reported to be not significant in the literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR33">33</xref>]. Furthermore it is demonstrated that unlike vitamin K, vitamin D does not change undercarboxylated OC ratio with OC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR32">32</xref>]. All of these documents point to the equivocal response of bone tissue to the administration of vitamin D supplement.</p><p>Weightlessness situations cause decrease in PTH level which in turn causes decrease in calcitriol level with the net result for serum calcium content to become dependent on skeletal calcium resorpsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR34">34</xref>]. Although a rare presentation, hypercalcemia mediated by calcitriol is reported in specific patients like sarcoidosis and lymphoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR35">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR36">36</xref>], here we have shown decrease in serum calcium content after administration of calcitiol along with suppression of bone metabolic markers including ALP ad OC. This shows hypometabolic state of bone metabolism and decrease in serum calcium content similar to the effect of steroid on bone metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR37">37</xref>]. Altogether these findings indicate antiresorptive effect of calcitriol on bone metabolism. The inability of calcitriol supplementation in increasing the serum calcium content may be in part explained by lack of calcium supplementation and possible counter absorptive effect of calcitriol of bone metabolism theorized here.</p><p>Our data was consistent with the inhibiting effect of calcitriol on bone osteoblastic activity. This was accompanied by lower values for serum calcium in the calcitriol supplemented group, which may point to the simultaneous inhibition of osteoclastic activity in this group. Considering that bone osteoclastic activity that leads to release of calcium from bone tissue is the underlying cause for space flight induced osteoporosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>] herein it is hypothesized that calcitriol suppresses bone turnover thereby preventing osteoporosis in rat tail suspension model. The inhibition of bone turnover by calcitriol is reflected in lower values for OC, ALP and serum calcium content in our study though they were not statistically significant pointing to the need for further studies in future.</p><p>We note the following limitations to our study. First, limited number of rats was included in our study which may result in low power of the study. Although the sample size calculation and power assessments demonstrated that our study has the 90% power to detect the significant difference the study results did not become significant.</p><p>Second, change in ALP and OC levels obey a bimodal pattern during tail suspension. This pattern was reported by a study conducted on different strains of mice indicating that although serum levels of ALP and OC increase after 2&#x000a0;weeks of suspension, their values tend to restore in the next week [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. This pattern point to the need for multiple sampling during tail suspension studies to detect significant differences.</p><p>Third, we did not assess other biomarkers of bone metabolism. This could limit our interpretation of cellular responses to treatment regimens. However objectively, it is clear that biomarkers of bone formation that we studied here, account for osteoblastic activity in the process of bone turn over and their results accompanied by the measurement of other markers of bone metabolism like vitamin D and calcium would yield to appropriate assessment of bone metabolism in the study.</p><p>Future studies with larger study populations and measurement of other biomarkers of bone metabolism are recommended to support the result of our study.</p></sec><sec id="Sec9" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have studied the biomarkers of bone formation to assess the effect of calcitriol supplementation on bone cellular responses during weightlessness in rats by means of tail suspension model that is the model of choice for space flight simulation in laboratory.</p><p>In conclusion, supplementation of daily diet with activated vitamin D could result in lower levels of OC and ALP, along with lower levels of serum calcium in hindlimb suspended rats compared to tail suspension alone in animal model of weightlessness. This was in favor of inhibiting effect of calcitriol on bone turnover and thereby inhibiting the process of osteoporosis in tail suspended rats. Our study possess some limitations including low number of study groups leading to statistically not significant results pointing to the need for future studies to test the hypothesized role for calcitriol supplementation on bone metabolism in space flight animal models.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></fn><fn><p><bold>Authors&#x02019; contributions</bold></p><p>SJH contributed to the development of the concept, implementation of the study and conducting the procedures.
