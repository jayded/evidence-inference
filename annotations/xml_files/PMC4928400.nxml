We performed a retrospective analysis of 42 patients presenting with obstructive pyelonephritis due to proximal ureteral stones larger than 1.5 cm from April 2006 to February 2015. All patients were initially given parenteral antibiotics and underwent nephrostomy tube placement. After drainage of pyonephrosis and resolution of sepsis, 22 patients were treated with TPLU (Group I), and 20 patients were treated with F-URS (Group II) for stone removal.</p><p>Stone size was measured by using the longest axis of stone viewed on preoperative imaging. Patients who had multiple stones, or younger than 18 years of age were excluded. The data were collected prospectively and analyzed retrospectively. The treatment method was chosen by considering the preference of the patients, after the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques were discussed with the patients.</p><p>The diagnosis of obstructive pyelonephritis was based on the symptoms of sepsis, the presence of flank pain, radiological findings (confirmation of ureteral stone and concomitant hydronephrosis), and laboratory data, such as bacteriuria and leukocyturia. The drainage of obstructive pyelonephritis was carried out mainly by antegrade percutaneous nephrostomy. Nephrostomy tube using a 8-Fr pigtail stent was carried out under ultrasound and fluoroscopic guidance. All patients received proper antibiotic treatment according to urine culture preoperatively.</p><p>All operations were performed by single experienced surgeon (VT) under general anesthesia. An indwelling JJ ureteral stent was placed and then the nephrostomy catheter was removed at the end of the procedure in all patients. On postoperative day one plain film was taken to check the position of the JJ stent and clinically insignificant residual fragments (&#x0003c; 4 mm). Ureteral stents were removed 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Intravenous Urography was performed at three months of follow-up. Subsequent follow-up of the patients was sone at 6 months and then annually.</p><p>Patient demographics, stone characteristics, and procedure related parameters including success rate, operation time, VAS (visual analog scale), hospital stay, and complications were noted and compared for each group. Modified Clavien Grading System was used for classification of the complications.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Number Cruncher Statistical System (NCCS) 2007 Statistical Software (Kaysville, Utah, USA) program. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistical methods (mean, standard deviation, median, frequency and rate) as well as the normal distribution showing comparisons between groups of variables Independent Samples Test; variables did not show normal distribution, Mann-Whitney-U test was used. In the comparison of qualitative datas Yates Continuity Correction and Fisher&#x02019;s exact test was used. P &#x0003c; 0.05 was considered statistically significant.</p></sec><sec sec-type="results" id="sec1-3"><title>RESULTS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient and Stone Characteristics</title><p>The present study included 26 (61.9%) men and 16 (38.1%) women.

In this study, we showed that TPLU had a higher stone-free and lower retreatment rate compared with F-URS. On the other hand, patients treated with F-URS had less postoperative pain, a shorter hospital stay and a faster return to daily activities. But surprisingly, two techniques did not differ significantly in terms of complication rates and operation times.</p><p>Obstructive pyelonephritis secondary to ureteral stones requires emergency drainage of the renal collecting system with percutaneous nephrostomy tube or double-J stent.<xref rid="ref1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="ref2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> An early diagnosis, urgent drainage of the collecting system, and proper treatment with antibiotics are essential steps for the management of these patients. An obstructed and infected kidney can progress to life-threatining conditions such as urosepsis and septic shock despite urgent drainage and appropriate antibiotic therapy, a mortality rate of 2% may still be expected.<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref> After drainage of pyonephrosis and resolution of sepsis, definitive treatment for the ureteral stone should be planned. However, the best treatment option for those cases is still controversial, especially for large and impacted stones.</p><p>Available techniques include SWL, semirigid or flexible URS, laparoscopic ureterolithotomy and open surgery. Selecting the best technique for the treatment of stones should favor not only the minimally invasive and comfortable method but also the most effective procedure.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Although SWL has been accepted as the first treatment option for proximal ureteral stones smaller than 1 cm with low complication and high stone-free rates, a general reluctance exists to choose this non-invasive technique for large upper ureteral stones.<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In a recent study, Lopes Neto et al. prospectively compared the effectiveness of URS, SWL and laparoscopic ureterolithotomy for the treatment of large upper ureteral stones and found a low success rate of 37.5%, with SWL.<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>F-URS is another option with high success rate but has some difficulties in the management of impacted large upper ureteral stones. Difficulties about ureteroscopic methods was associated with accessing stones secondary to ureteral lesions such as edema or polyps and tortuous ureter.<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Kumar et al. reported a success rate of 86% in patients with impacted ureteral stones.<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In another study, Lee et al. reported a retreatment rate of 42% with F-URS in cases having large proximal ureteral stones.<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> In a recent study, including 103 patients with stone size more than 1.5 cm, Ko et al. compared the URS and laparoscopic ureterolithotomy.<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref> The stone clearence rate was significantly higher in the laparoscopy group (100%) as compared to URS (77%) group.</p><p>Laparoscopic ureterolithotomy can be performed through a retroperitoneal or transperitoneal route. In this study, transperitoneal approach was used in all cases. The most important advantages of transperitoneal route over the retroperitoneal one is that it provides the good working space and identification of anatomical landmarks are easier. Our study showed that the stone-free rate was significantly greater in the TPLU group (100%) as compared to the F-URS (80%) group, which indicated TPLU was a perfect option for proximal ureteral stones. However, the patients treated with F-URS had less postoperative pain, a shorter hospital stay and a faster return to daily activities.</p><p>The complication rate after F-URS (22%) was lower than after TPLU (35%), with no statistically significant difference. There was no important infectious complication such as sepsis or septic shock and deaths in each group. Two patients in group II had fever on the first day after operation, which resolved with antibiotic treatment. Our results suggest that post-drainage F-URS and TPLU are safe and feasible techniques.</p><sec id="sec2-4"><title>Limitation of the study</title><p>Our study is a retrospective analysis of a single institution with a limited number of cases.

On the other hand F-URS has the advantages of less postoperative pain, shorter hospital stay and faster return to daily activities.</p></sec></body><back><fn-group><fn fn-type="conflict"><p><bold><italic>Declaration of interest statement:</italic></bold> The authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.</p></fn></fn-group><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="ref1"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wagenlehner</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><name><surname>Lichtenstern</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Rolfes</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Uhle</surname><given-names>F</given-names></name><name><surname>Weidner</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Diagnosis and management for urosepsis</article-title><source>Int J Urol</source><year>2013</year><volume>20</volume><fpage>963</fpage><lpage>970</lpage><comment>doi:10.1111/iju.12200</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">23714209</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref2"><label>2</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Wagenlehner</surname><given-names>FM</given-names></name><name><surname>Pilatz</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Weidner</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name></person-group><article-title>Urosepsis&#x02014;from the view of the urologist</article-title><source>Int J Antimicrob Agents</source><year>2011</year><volume>38</volume><issue>Suppl</issue><fpage>51</fpage><lpage>57</lpage><comment>doi:10.1016/j.ijantimicag.2011.09.007</comment><pub-id pub-id-type="pmid">21993485</pub-id></element-citation></ref><ref id="ref3"><label>3</label><element-citation publication-type="journal"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Ramsey</surname><given-names>S1</given-names></name><name><surname>Robertson</surname><given-names>A</given-names></name><name><surname>Ablett</surname><given-names>MJ</given-names></name><name><surname>Meddings</surname><given-names>RN</given-names></name><name><surname>Hollins</surname><given-names>GW</given-names></name><name><surname>Little</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name><etal/></person-group><article-title>Evidence-based drainage of infected hydronephrosis secondary to ureteric calculi</article-title><source>J.
