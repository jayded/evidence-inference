The primary objective was to assess clinical efficacy as measured by pain and Lequesne&#x02019;s index. Secondary objectives were to assess potential effect of the treatment on ultrasound parameters, safety and biomarkers of cartilage metabolism and joint inflammation. After a selection visit (V1), the study treatment was administered 3 times on a weekly basis (V2, V3, V4). Follow-up was planned 6 (V5) and 12&#x02009;weeks (V6) after the first intra-articular injection. Efficacy results showed a reduction in mean pain at V3 and V6 and in functional impairment, the most marked changes being measured at the two follow-up visits (V5 and V6). Although statistical significance was not achieved due to small sample size, a clear tendency towards improvement was detectable for ultrasound assessments as well as biomarkers. Except for a mild injection site hematoma for which the drug causal relationship could not be excluded, no adverse effect of clinical relevance was recorded during the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Although this pilot study was performed according to an open design only, the ultrasound as well as biomarkers changes strongly suggest a non-placebo effect. These preliminary results call now for a randomized controlled study to confirm the clinical relevance of the observed results.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>#ISRCTN91883031</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>Chondroitin sulphate</kwd><kwd>Hyaluronic acid</kwd><kwd>Knee osteoarthritis</kwd><kwd>Clinical trial</kwd><kwd>Osteoarthritis treatment</kwd><kwd>Ultrasonography</kwd><kwd>Biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Findings</title><p>In the treatment of osteoarthritis (OA), it is now agreed that surgical procedures should be at least delayed, and even avoid inasmuch as possible.</p><p>Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a component of the synovial fluid, the lubricating effect of which is related to its viscoelastic properties. There is a large agreement that early manifestations of OA are related to changes in the viscoelasticity of the synovial fluid which account for a decrease in the protective action of the cartilage: such deterioration appears mainly due to a decrease in the concentration and molecular weight of synovial HA.</p><p>HA injections into the joint may compensate for this deficit in elasticity, thereby improving articular lubrication. There is a large body of data regarding HS biocompatibility, its toxicology as well as its metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>].</p><p>Regarding HA clinical efficacy in knee OA, a number of studies are available, some of them performed according a double-blind placebo-controlled design [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>]. According to the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations published in 2003, &#x000ab; there is evidence to support the efficacy of HA in the management of knee OA both for pain reduction and functional improvement &#x000bb; which may induce pain relief &#x000ab; for several months &#x000bb; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>].</p><p>Structovial CS (Pierre Fabre M&#x000e9;dicament) is a medical device combining a chondroitin sulphate (CS) (30&#x02009;mg/mL) and HA (12&#x02009;mg/mL) to treat knee OA. The biocompatibility of both products has been assessed during Structovial CS development. The role of CS is twofold: i) optimizing HA&#x02019;s rheological behaviour, due to specific interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]; ii) regulating cartilage metabolism, as a substrate for polysulphated glycosaminoglycans synthesis as well as an inhibitor of catabolic cytokines and metalloproteinases synthesis (11-13).</p><p>The primary objective of this study was to provide some clinical, sonographic, biologic parameters of 3 weekly intra-articular injections of HA/CS in knees affected by OA over a period of 12&#x02009;weeks.</p><p>Secondary objectives were to: i) assess the treatment effect on ultrasound (US) parameters; ii) analyze biomarkers known as related to cartilage metabolism and to joint inflammation; and iii) assess the treatment safety.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This was a single-centre, open-label, uncontrolled study (Trial registration #ISRCTN91883031) designed to assess intra-articular injections of HA/CS in knee OA.</p><sec><title>Patients</title><p>Inclusion criteria were: male or female patients aged &#x02265; 45 and &#x02264; 80&#x02009;years; suffering from internal and/or external femoro-tibial OA: meeting the criteria of the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (14) (pain of the knee and crepitus on active motion or morning stiffness &#x0003c; 30 minutes or age &#x0003e;50&#x02009;years); lasting for at least 6&#x02009;months; pain &#x02265; 40&#x02009;mm as measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS); stage II or III within the previous year according to the radiological classification of Kellgren and Lawrence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>]); OA deemed to justify a treatment with intra-articular HA according to the investigator; patient&#x02019;s written, informed consent.</p><p>Non-inclusion criteria were related to any circumstances likely to interfere with the study treatment, namely: symptomatic femoro-patellar arthrosis or hip arthrosis on the same side, concomitant skeletal disease (Paget disease, rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis&#x02026;); former or concomitant treatment (intra-articular corticosteroids, topical or oral NSAIDs, anti-arthritis slow acting treatment, recent surgery&#x02026;); individual characteristics incompatible with a drug trial (pregnancy or lack of contraception, serious concomitant disease, participation in a clinical trial within the preceding 30&#x02009;days&#x02026;).

In the event of severe pain, and if necessary, patients were permitted to take 1 gram tablets of acetaminophen, 1 at a time, up to 4 times per day, with a minimum of 4 hours between tablets. If the recommended dosage of acetaminophen was insufficient, it was permitted to take a NSAID.</p></sec><sec><title>Study schedule</title><p>The selection period ran from Day -21 to Day -1 (V1). The patients participated in the study from Day 0 to Day 84. The investigational drug was a sterile solution of HA/CS for intra-articular injections: each 2&#x02009;mL injection contained 24&#x02009;mg of HA and 60&#x02009;mg of CS. It was injected on a weekly basis, on Days 0 (V2), 7 (V3, one week), and 14 (V4, 2&#x02009;weeks). Then, Days 42 (V5, 6&#x02009;weeks) and 84 (V6, 12&#x02009;weeks) were for follow-up and end-of-study assessments, which brought to 6 the total of scheduled visits throughout the study.</p></sec><sec><title>Study parameters</title><sec><title>Clinical parameters</title><p>The main recorded parameters were a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) to measure spontaneous pain (from 0 = no pain to 100 = maximum pain), Lequesne&#x02019;s Algo-Functional Knee Index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>], concomitant medication as well as adverse events if any; on V1 (first injection) and V6 (end-of-study follow-up). Overall assessment of improvement was assessed by the patient and by the investigator, using a VAS (from 0 = worsening to 100 = improvement). The clinical response was assessed at V5 and V6 using the criteria defined by the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>].

Synovial thickness was measured on a longitudinal image of the suprapatellar recess with an extended knee, with a knee flexed at 545&#x000b0; and on a transversal scan of the lateral recess.

Efficacy was assessed through measure of pain, functional impairment, clinical response, ultrasound and biomarkers.</p><p>Both pain intensity and functional impairment decreased during the study. The most significant changes for both parameters were observed at 6 and 12&#x02009;weeks after the first study injection.</p><p>The patient and investigator assessment of global improvement changed only marginally throughout the study.

With a larger sample size this probable effect on the synovial inflammation could be demonstrated.</p><p>The 5 measured biomarkers displayed a high variability although they tended to decrease in a consistent way throughout the study.</p><p>No serious adverse events, no adverse event leading to study discontinuation, and no deaths were reported during the study.</p><p>A total of 4 (13.3%) adverse events (AEs) were reported throughout the study: injection site haematoma, wrist fracture, arthralgia, and venous stasis. The injection site haematoma was of mild intensity. For this AE, the investigator did not exclude a relation to the study drug.</p><p>No other change of clinical relevance was observed in physical examination or vital signs.</p><p>On the basis of these results, the discussion should be balanced. In this non controlled study, the improvement in clinical parameters (pain intensity, functional impairment) was not clearly greater than that which could be induced by a placebo in a controlled study. On the other hand, the structural as well as biomarkers changes suggest a non-placebo effect, as lack of statistical significant for both &#x0201c;objective&#x0201d; parameters is most probably a consequence of small sample size. In particular, biomarkers changes appeared quite consistent although statistically not significant, with a decrease in Coll2-1 (degradation marker) and in IL-6 and Coll2-1NO2 (markers of oxidative stress and of inflammation). In a previous study, Hosigawa et al. already showed that intra-articular injection of hyaluronan was associated with a reduction in biomarkers in synovial fluid, suggesting that HA could help maintain normal cartilage metabolism at least in patients at an early stage of OA and with limited synovitis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>]. The biomarkers are the reflect of cartilage degradation, then directly correlated with the disease activity (i.e. inflammation and pain). The change in biomarker levels due to the medical device over time can be linked to the change in disease activity. By the way, the more important is the change in biomarkers, the more important is the effect on pain.</p><p>Overall, the results of this pilot study are consistent with a favourable benefit/risk ratio of the medical device used, but they strongly call for undergoing now a randomized clinical trial with the required statistical power.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Intra-articular injections of HA is a well-established therapy for the treatment of knee OA. The study was designed to support the clinical efficacy and safety data on the use of HA when combined with CS for intra-articular injections.</p><p>The injection pattern of 1 injection weekly over 3&#x02009;weeks is the current treatment pattern of most clinical studies of HA to date and is the treatment pattern of HA solutions available on the market. The present study followed this treatment regimen.</p><p>Although limited by a lack of control group as well as small sample size, the results of this pilot study suggest that intra-articular treatment with HA/CS (Structovial CS, Pierre Fabre M&#x000e9;dicament) is effective and safe in patients with knee OA. These results should be confirmed now by a randomised clinical trial on a bigger sample size.</p></sec><sec><title>Abbreviations</title><p>AE: adverse event; CS: chondroitin sulfate; HA: hyaluronic acid; IL: interleukine; OA: osteoarthritis; US: ultrasound; VAS: visual analog scale.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>PB is an employee of Pierre Fabre pharmaceutical company.
