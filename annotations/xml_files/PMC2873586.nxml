The overall goal of the current project is to measure the effectiveness of a healthy eating and childhood obesity prevention intervention, the MEND (Mind Exercise Nutrition Do It!) program that is delivered to parents of children aged 2-4 years.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><p>This randomised controlled trial will be conducted with 200 parents and their 2-4 year old children who attend the MEND 2-4 program in metropolitan and regional Victoria. Parent-child dyads will attend ten 90-minute group workshops. These workshops focus on general nutrition, as well as physical activity and behaviours. They are typically held at community or maternal and child health centres and run by a MEND 2-4 trained program leader. Child eating habits, physical activity levels and parental behaviours and cognitions pertaining to nutrition and physical activity will be assessed at baseline, the end of the intervention, and at 6 and 12 months post the intervention. Informed consent will be obtained from all parents, who will then be randomly allocated to the intervention or wait-list control group.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Our study is the first RCT of a healthy eating and childhood obesity prevention intervention targeted specifically to Australian parents and their preschool children aged 2-4 years. It responds to the call by experts in the area of childhood obesity and child health that prevention of overweight in the formative preschool years should focus on parents, given that parental beliefs, attitudes, perceptions and behaviours appear to impact significantly on the development of early overweight. This is 'solution-oriented' rather than 'problem-oriented' research, with its focus being on prevention rather than intervention. If this is a positive trial, the MEND2-4 program can be implemented as a national program.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial Registration</title><p>Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12610000200088</p></sec></abstract></article-meta></front><body><sec><title>Background</title><p>Epidemiological studies indicate that childhood overweight is a serious problem in Australia, with an estimated 1 in 4 Australian school aged children and adolescents either overweight or obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B1">1</xref>]. Alarmingly, obesity is seen in even younger children, with rates of overweight and obesity almost doubling in a sample of 114,669 Australian 4-year-olds over the period 1995-2002 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B2">2</xref>]. More recently, data from 4934 4- to 5-year-olds from the first wave of the nationally representative Longitudinal Study of Australian Children revealed that 15.3% of preschoolers were overweight and a further 5.2% obese [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>]. Thus, the cost to society of obesity is high, with Access Economics estimating that the total annual cost of obesity to Australian society in 2008 was $58.2 billion, up from $21 billion in 2005 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B4">4</xref>]. Furthermore, obesity in adults is strongly associated with the development of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus and some cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B5">5</xref>]. Overweight and obese children and adolescents are also at risk of a range of health problems and have an increased risk of premature death in adulthood; there are both immediate complications and long term consequences of child and adolescent obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B6">6</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>]. Research has shown that obesity can also have psychological consequences among children, such as increased stigmatization and depression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B10">10</xref>]. The desire for thinness is present in girls as young as six years of age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref>] and our research reveals that 4-year-old children are already concerned about their hair and clothes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>]. Higher weight status in 5-year-old girls has also been found to be associated with lower self-concept [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B13">13</xref>]; hence, preschoolers are at risk of obesity's negative psychological consequences.</p><p>Whilst strong evidence supports the role of non-modifiable genetic factors in energy storage patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref>], these are insufficient to explain the increase in childhood overweight in recent years. Given that child weight is a multi-determined condition, researchers now argue that obesity prevention/intervention strategies must influence multiple determinants of child risk factors for overweight and obesity (i.e., increase in high-calorie, nutrient-poor food consumption, increase in sedentary behaviours, and a lack of physical activity, as well as parental attitudes and behaviours) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>]. The primary institution influencing preschool children is the family; consequently, many of the potentially modifiable determinants of risk factors for overweight and obesity in the preschool years will have roots within the family context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>]. Indeed, positive associations between certain aspects of parenting and preschool childhood overweight/obesity have been documented: parenting practices/behaviours and the beliefs supporting these strategies including maternal feeding practices, such as restricting access to foods and pressuring to eat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>]; reduced parental instrumental support for engagement in health promoting behaviours (e.g., not providing access or prompts for healthy eating or physical activity) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref>]; low levels of parental modelling of healthy eating habits and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref>]; and low parental nutritional knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B26">26</xref>].</p><p>In recent years, researchers have also examined the ways in which parents "<italic>parent</italic>" their children and found that particular parenting and feeding styles (i.e., authoritarian and permissive feeding styles) impact on young children's weight status [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B3">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B28">28</xref>]. Yet, despite widespread evidence that parenting behaviours, beliefs, and knowledge as well as parenting and feeding styles, are important in the development and maintenance of child obesity, relatively few studies have examined systematically whether targeting parental influences to modify these risk factors within a complex intervention will have an effect on weight status in preschool children.</p><p>Our systematic review (Skouteris H, McCabe M, Swinburn B, Newgreen V, Sacher P, Chadwick P: Parental influence and obesity prevention in preschoolers: A systematic review of interventions, submitted) revealed that worldwide only eight RCTs have been conducted since 1995 on prevention of obesity in the 2-4 year old age group, and only one of these was conducted in Australia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B29">29</xref>]; the age range targeted in this Australian study was 3-10 years, and the four-by-two-hour weekly group parent-education intervention program was for overweight children with a 3-month follow up period. This brief intervention for parents was effective in reducing childhood overweight at 3 months follow-up. Other studies have also shown that teaching parents about nutrition and healthy lifestyle behaviours results in improved knowledge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B30">30</xref>] and health behaviours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>] and this can result in weight improvements for their children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B31">31</xref>]. A key conclusion in the literature is the lack of translation of knowledge to action [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B32">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B33">33</xref>] and for this reason, future interventions should also specifically target strategies and techniques which parents can use to modify their child's dietary and physical activity patterns. It is argued that interventions that involve parents in a significant way may be particularly effective; they are likely to work by improving parental engagement, skills, and ability to provide opportunities for active play for their child and to create a healthy nutritional home environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>].</p><p>The MEND (Mind, Exercise, Nutrition, Do It!) 2-4 program was designed to address this need for a healthy lifestyle program in the early years of childhood as well as a secondary obesity prevention initiative. MEND 2-4 is a 10-week community-based, multi-component healthy lifestyle program that is offered free to families with young children aged 2-4 years, irrespective of weight. The program aims to encourage healthy habits around diet and activity from an early age. It is a highly structured group program allowing parents to be supported in establishing healthy habits and making healthy behaviour changes at their own pace [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>]. MEND 2-4 leaders are provided with comprehensive training by MEND Australia, and receive a leader's manual together with a full resource kit. The MEND 2-4 program is open to parents of children of any weight, although it is recommended that 'at risk' children be targeted (via referrals from General Practioners, Pediatricians, or Maternal and Child Health Nurses), including children who have/are: parental obesity, inactive and/or have poor eating habits, a risk of developing co-morbidities (e.g., family history of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, specific ethnic minorities). The overall goal of the current project is to measure the effectiveness of the MEND 2-4 program by conducting a randomised controlled trial (RCT).</p></sec><sec><title>Methods/Design</title><sec><title>Overall study design</title><p>This study is a randomised controlled trial with parents of 2- to 4-year-olds randomly allocated to either the intervention or control groups and will be conducted and reported in line with CONSORT recommendations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B36">36</xref>] (see Figure <xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">1</xref>).

Every effort will be made to include families from diverse ethnic backgrounds, given that different SES and ethnic groups exhibit differences in parental attitudes and beliefs in relation to feeding practices, child weight gain, and physical activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>].</p><sec><title>Procedure</title><sec><title>The Intervention</title><p>The MEND 2-4 program involves 10 weekly 90 minute workshops relating to general nutrition, physical activity and behaviours, that are typically held at community health and maternal and child health centres, where parents and their preschool-aged children attend together. Each program group will consist of 6-10 child-parent dyads and a MEND 2-4 trained program leader. Program leaders, who are trained extensively by MEND Australia prior to starting with a group, will be monitored and evaluated by MEND Australia staff to ensure their practice is in accordance with MEND 2-4 guidelines; parental feedback on program leaders will also be obtained. Each session involves 30 minutes of guided active play, where parents can learn how to play with their children; 15 minutes of healthy snack time based on an evidence-based exposure-based technique to promote acceptance and increased intake of fruit and vegetables [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B38">38</xref>] and 45 minutes where the children participate in supervised cr&#x000e8;che-style, creative play activities and concurrently the parents attend an interactive education and skill development session, based on evidence-based group-based parent-training principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B39">39</xref>]. Table <xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">1</xref> outlines the weekly education topics, and parents will receive handouts on these topics weekly. Pilot data reveals low attrition and that parents value the program and attend all 10 sessions. In the initial MEND 2-4 trials (UK) the participation rate was 87.6% which is high for developmental research [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B35">35</xref>].</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Discussion topics and intervention content of MEND 2-4 program</p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left">Week</th><th align="left">Workshop Title</th><th align="left">Discussion Topic(s)</th><th align="left">Intervention Content</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left">1</td><td align="left"><bold>Welcome &#x00026; introduction</bold></td><td align="left">Meet the leader and pre-program measurements</td><td align="left">Meet and welcome the families to their first MEND 2-4 physical activity and snack-time session; parents complete all pre-program forms and questionnaires and accurate child and parent anthropometric measurements (height and weight) taken.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">2</td><td align="left"><bold>Introduction</bold></td><td align="left">Introductions and individual expectations</td><td align="left">Discussion of individual expectations and introduction of MEND 2-4 program and practicalities; Introduction of parents/carers to the behavioural model of parenting (customised as the 4Cs model (Causes, Consequences, Consistency and Copying) for the purposes of MEND 2-4).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="4"><hr/></td></tr><tr><td align="left">3</td><td align="left"><bold>Healthy eating for families</bold></td><td align="left">Healthy eating</td><td align="left">Introduction to the five food groups, visual samples of excess sugar and fat found in foods.

Vegetable consumption will require the largest sample size to demonstrate change over time, compared to other dietary outcomes, such as sweetened drinks, packaged snacks (e.g., chips, muesli bar), confectionary/chocolate, cake/sweet biscuits, and fruit, based on sample size analyses. As there are no quantitative dietary recommendations for children less than 4 years old in Australia, we adopted Campbell et al.'s suggestion of a 25% increase in vegetable consumption as a minimum target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B61">61</xref>]. Based on Mathews et al.'s finding that 63% of pre-school children had &#x02264;1 serve of vegetables per day [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B60">60</xref>], we assume that the intervention will have a 25% absolute effect, that is the proportion of children in the intervention group who only have &#x02264;1 serve of vegetables per day will change from 63% to 43%. We calculated the sample size necessary to detect a clinically meaningful difference in vegetable consumption, significant at the 0.05 level, with a power of 0.8; this calculation resulted in a sample of 100 parents in each group. Making a prudent allowance for attrition of 20% (attrition in a large longitudinal study with multiple time points over a 3-year period by Clark et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B62">62</xref>]) the adjusted number per treatment condition is 120. A total of 240 parents of 2-4 year old children will therefore be recruited at baseline to allow for a final sample of 200. The final sample size of 200 participants is also sufficient to detect medium effect sizes in the secondary measures with a power of 0.8 at &#x003b1; = 0.05 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B63">63</xref>]. Every CI on this research team has had experience in retention of participants in longitudinal studies. To facilitate retention we will build rapport with the participants by a regular newsletter and advance notification of assessments. To increase retention rates the CIs have found two measures are very helpful: 1) Parents who remain in the study will be entered into prize draws for gift vouchers. The amount needs to include a large grand prize plus multiple minor prizes. Prizes will be drawn each year. 2) Birthday cards will be sent out to each child participant.</p></sec><sec><title>Analyses</title><p>We will adhere to 'intention-to-treat' principles following CONSORT Statement guidelines to prevent introduction of systematic bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B34">34</xref>]. As such, baseline data will be secured prior to treatment allocation, missing values will be scrutinized to check for non-random distribution and primary analyses will be executed twice: once using observed data, and once using multiple imputation under multivariate normal assumptions using methods given by Schafer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B64">64</xref>], so that all participants will be analysed in their allocated condition. Analyses of covariance (with "other relevant variables" from above as covariates) will test the between group differences in the primary and secondary outcomes at each assessment time point and across time points for the parents and children. Finally, the interview transcripts will be analysed using elements of phenomenology and thematic content analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B65">65</xref>], as demonstrated by Clark et al. and Powell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B66">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B67">67</xref>].</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Obesity has reached epidemic proportions in Australia and calls have been made for strategies to reverse this unhealthy trend [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B68">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B69">69</xref>]. Early prevention of obesity, that is, developing effective prevention and intervention programs for the formative preschool years, is seen as one essential step in combating the obesity epidemic across the lifespan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>]. The preschool years have been identified as a critical period in childhood for the development of childhood obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B71">71</xref>] because the eating and physical activity habits that contribute to later obesity become established during these formative years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B72">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B73">73</xref>]. Targeting preschool aged children is central to preventing obesity, because development at this life stage is more malleable than it is in later childhood and adolescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B47">47</xref>], and risk factors of overweight can be more easily modified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B74">74</xref>]. Despite these findings, there is a paucity of strategies aimed directly at preschool children [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B70">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B75">75</xref>]. This study aims to address this urgent need to develop and test the effectiveness of prevention programs for children at the preschool age. Such prevention programs need to be family-based [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B76">76</xref>], because the primary social force that influences young children's health behaviour and development is the parent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B37">37</xref>]. Our intervention will provide information to parents and support them to establish and/or maintain healthy behaviours and attitudes around diet and physical activity for themselves and their preschool child(ren). If effective, this program could protect children from the development of obesity and its associated psychological, social and economic costs. Furthermore, this study has the potential to strengthen our knowledge base of health-promoting strategies that can be aimed at parents, which will hopefully lead to future national and international policy changes in relation to obesity prevention as well as the promotion of change at a global level.</p></sec><sec><title>Competing interests</title><p>The authors declare that they have no competing interests.</p></sec><sec><title>Authors' contributions</title><p>Together, HS, MM, and BS wrote and designed the study subsequently funded by the Australian Research Council, and modified it for publication.
