The randomised controlled trial (RCT) will evaluate the effects on health status (measured by the King&#x02019;s Brief ILD Questionnaire: K-BILD) of ambulatory oxygen used at home, at an optimal flow rate determined by titration at screening visit, and administered for a 2-week period, compared to 2&#x000a0;weeks off oxygen. Key secondary outcomes will include breathlessness on activity scores, as measured by the University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire, global patient assessment of change scores, as well as quality of life scores (St George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire), anxiety and depression scores (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale), activity markers measured by SenseWear Armbands, pulse oximetry measurements, patient-reported daily activities, patient- and oxygen company-reported oxygen cylinder use.

Breathlessness is the main determinant of quality of life in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), the most common of the idiopathic ILDs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR1">1</xref>]. Fibrotic lung diseases profoundly affect an individual&#x02019;s sense of wellbeing, with anxiety, depression and fatigue often accompanying exertional limitation, leading to a loss of health status. With limited pharmacological therapy proven to prolong survival in many ILDs, attempts to improve or maintain health status are of crucial importance.</p><p>Breathlessness on exertion, formally measured by the 6-min Walk Test (6MWT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>], is often associated with a fall in oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>), which in ILD patients can be particularly marked [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. The 6MWT is a widely used field test measuring functional exercise capacity, repeatedly observed to have good validity as a functional and prognostic marker in IPF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>]. Ambulatory oxygen used during a 6MWT or bicycle endurance test has been reported to improve breathlessness, distance walked, and breathlessness recovery time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Frank and coauthors reported that further up-titration of ambulatory oxygen in order to maintain saturation values above 90% and/or reaching a 6-L/min flow rate during a 6MWT seemed to improve exercise capacity in IPF, as measured by a 6MWT, even in patients already using oxygen at home [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. However, two studies have failed to report a significant benefit on distance walked or dyspnoea of supplemental oxygen on either the 6MWT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>] or a shuttle endurance test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>], possibly because neither adequately titrated oxygen requirements to appropriately correct the patient&#x02019;s exertional desaturation, as suggested in a recent Cochrane review [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>].</p><p>Although a number of chest physicians prescribe ambulatory oxygen to ILD patients with desaturation on exercise, there are no nationally recognised guidelines to direct ambulatory oxygen prescription. In particular, NICE guidelines for oxygen use only address chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG101">http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG101</ext-link>), a disease which markedly differs from IPF or other ILDs. The recent British Thoracic Society (BTS) oxygen guidelines only briefly touch on ambulatory oxygen and give no specific guidance on its use in ILD, indeed recommending against its use in most cases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>]. Specifically, there are no published studies investigating the effects of ambulatory oxygen on day-to-day life in patients with fibrotic ILD, or assessing whether oxygen-induced improvements in 6MWT performance predict response to supplemental oxygen during activities of daily living, and an overall improvement in health status.</p><p>We have, therefore, planned a prospective study to assess whether individuals with fibrotic ILD whose SaO<sub>2</sub> falls to &#x02264;88% on a 6MWT, but are not hypoxic at rest, benefit from the use of ambulatory oxygen in their daily lives, by assessing changes in health status. The proposed project is the first of its kind in ILD, and addresses an under-researched area in urgent need of study. The study has the potential to lead to significant advances in the treatment and the understanding of exercise limitation in patients with ILD, and will represent an essential step towards the development of guidelines on oxygen use in ILD.</p><sec id="Sec2"><title>Objectives</title><p>The main aim of this project is to establish whether ambulatory oxygen in patients with fibrotic ILD whose oxygen saturation falls to &#x02264;88% on a 6MWT, leads to a significant improvement in health status, as measured by the King&#x02019;s Brief Interstitial Lung Disease Questionnaire (K-BILD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>]. Key additional outcomes will be the evaluation of dyspnoea during activities of daily living as measured by the University of California San Diego Shortness of Breath Questionnaire (UCSD SOBQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], as well as the global patient assessment of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>]. Further secondary outcomes will include monitored (SenseWear Armbands) and patient-recorded activity parameters, as well as quality of life scores assessed by the St. George&#x02019;s Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. We also aim to assess whether the improvement in 6MWT performance induced by portable oxygen can predict benefit of ambulatory oxygen in day-to-day living, by a placebo air-controlled 6MWT performed at the start of the study, to assess changes to the 6MWT parameters induced by supplemental oxygen. An economic evaluation will assess the potential value for money provided by ambulatory oxygen by comparing the health system costs and health-related benefits to those of no ambulatory oxygen.</p><p>In addition, qualitative semistructured interviews at the end of the 4-week period in a subgroup of 20 patients will be conducted to evaluate patients&#x02019; and carers&#x02019; experiences regarding the use of ambulatory oxygen and trial participation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec3"><title>Methods/design</title><p>The AmbOx study is a UK, multicentre, prospective, randomised controlled crossover trial of ambulatory oxygen against no ambulatory oxygen over a 4-week period (2&#x000a0;weeks on ambulatory oxygen and 2&#x000a0;weeks on no portable oxygen), to evaluate the effects of ambulatory oxygen on health status in patients with ILD. Patients whose SaO<sub>2</sub> at rest is &#x02265;94% will be screened by performing a 6MWT as part of their routine clinical assessment in order to identify those patients whose SaO<sub>2</sub> drops to &#x02264;88%. In those who desaturate below this threshold, a further 6MWT will be conducted with titration of oxygen flow so that for least half of the 6MWT, oxygen saturation with supplemental oxygen is maintained at &#x0003e;90% (for more detailed information on oxygen titration, see section 10.2 of the protocol (Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>).</p><p>Following consent to the study, patients meeting eligibility criteria and deemed clinically stable at the end of the 2-week run-in period, and not expecting to require any change in their background medication, will be assigned in random order to 2&#x000a0;weeks on ambulatory oxygen or no oxygen during the baseline visit. Optimal oxygen flow rates will be determined during the screening visit on the basis of the entry 6MWT on oxygen, as detailed above. At the start of the active part of the trial, the effects of ambulatory oxygen on 6MWT performance will be formally evaluated by performing two 6MWTs, one on oxygen and one on placebo air-filled canisters, at the flow rate identified during the screening visit, in random order, with a rest of at least 30&#x000a0;min between tests. The patient will be blind to the content of the canisters. Measured parameters will include 6MWT distance, oxygen saturation and heart rate measured continuously (WristOx2&#x02122; model 3150), Borg Dyspnoea and Fatigue Score [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>] before and at the end of the test, time to recovery of heart rate, and oxygen saturation. These parameters will be related to changes in the primary and secondary outcome variables as detailed in subsequent sections, to identify any baseline predictors of responsiveness. Two different randomisation lists, independent of each other, will, therefore, be used. One randomisation list will determine the order of placebo air versus oxygen-filled canisters for the placebo-controlled 6MWT occurring at the baseline visit, the other randomisation list will determine the order of oxygen versus no intervention for the 4-week trial.</p><p>Following completion of the 2&#x000a0;weeks on the treatment arm assigned during the baseline visit (ambulatory oxygen or no intervention), patients will cross over to receive the alternative treatment for a further 2&#x000a0;weeks.

</p><p>The Patient Information Sheet and Informed Consent Form can be found in Additional files <xref rid="MOESM3" ref-type="media">3</xref> and <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>, respectively. Subjects should not enter the study if any of the exclusion criteria listed in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM5" ref-type="media">5</xref> are present. Patient will have had an echocardiogram and spirometry performed within 6&#x000a0;months prior to the screening visit or within 6&#x000a0;weeks following this. Serum brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels will be collected for all patients within a month from the screening visit.</p></sec><sec id="Sec6"><title>Intervention</title><p>Light-weight oxygen gas cylinders will be used to provide oxygen during activities (ambulatory oxygen). Ambulatory oxygen will be provided by the relevant oxygen companies in the UK, through submission of a Home Oxygen Order Form (HOOF) based on the location of the patient participating in the study. Overall, there are four oxygen companies which provide supplemental oxygen in the UK, including Air Liquide (which services North and South London, North and South West England, and the East Midlands), BOC (Eastern England and NorthEast), Baywater Healthcare (Yorkshire and Humberside, West Midlands and Wales) and Dolby Vivisol (South Central England and South East Coast). Continuous oxygen flow via nasal cannulae will be used for all patients to standardise mode of delivery. Oxygen flow rates will be determined on the basis of the entry 6MWT on oxygen, so as to maintain oxygen saturation of &#x02265;90% for at least half of the 6MWT, where possible. If the patients are randomised to start on oxygen on the first 2&#x000a0;weeks of the 4-week trial period, the company will be asked to remove any unused oxygen cylinders on the day of the crossover to the 2&#x000a0;weeks &#x02018;off&#x02019; oxygen. To determine oxygen use during the 2&#x000a0;weeks when patients are randomised to be on treatment, patients will be asked to keep a daily diary recording the number of hours spent using oxygen. Investigators will also ask the relevant oxygen company to provide the number of cylinders delivered to the patient per week along with the number of any unused or partially used cylinders (approximating to the nearest 25%) at the end of the 2&#x000a0;weeks on oxygen, wherever possible. To further validate patient-reported use of oxygen cylinders, a researcher at the Aintree site will sample 10 consecutive patients living in the nearby area and will visit patients at home at the end of the 2&#x000a0;weeks of ambulatory oxygen to independently assess numbers of fully used, half-used and full oxygen cylinders. Comparison between patient- and researcher-reported cylinders use will be included in data analysis. More information is provided in Section 13 of the study protocol.</p><p>The study design does not include a placebo arm because:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The intervention is a combination of possible benefits from oxygen and the disadvantage of canister weight. These cannot be separated. Placebo control is impossible because there is no means of providing placebo weight. Attempts to control solely for oxygen use without taking canister weight into account would not be clinically meaningful. In a recent COPD study, cylinder weight was reported as a barrier to use by 93% of study participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]</p></list-item><list-item><p>A positive result against an air-filled canister arm would be clinically uninterpretable. This is a study design in which the &#x02018;placebo&#x02019; would be actively harmful to study participants. Carriage of an air-filled cylinder would be expected to lead to earlier desaturation and reduced exercise tolerance. Such a design would not inform the real-life comparison between oxygen plus cylinder and no intervention</p></list-item><list-item><p>It should also be stressed that objective measures of change will be evaluated as secondary endpoints: we expect to explore correlations between these variables and the primary endpoint to exclude the possibility that an observed treatment benefit on the primary endpoint might be confounded by a placebo effect</p></list-item></list>
</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Concomitant medication</title><p>It will be possible to introduce any rescue medication during the study period as judged appropriate by the treating physician. However, the aim is to enrol subjects whose treatment is not expected to change during the 4-week treatment period of the trial. Patients who are on established treatment for their ILD, with immunosuppressants, corticosteroids, N-Acetyl Cysteine (NAC) and/or antifibrotic agents, will continue on their regular medication.

This degree of power will also allow us to perform some explanatory subgroup analyses, as out lined above. Although the study is powered to allow a 15% dropout rate, we will make every effort to minimise patient loss and missing data during the trial period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. In order to maximise completeness of data, patients will be called at the end of each week during the trial period. They will be reminded to wear the activity monitor and/or the oximeter for the allocated time, and will be encouraged to continue filling in their daily activity diaries.

In addition to the K-BILD, patients will be asked to complete the UCSD SOBQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>], a widely validated index, designed to assess activity-related dyspnoea, as well as the global patient assessment of change [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>], the SGRQ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>] and the HADS, both validated in ILD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec19"><title>Activity assessment</title><p>During the second week of each of the 2-week periods of the study treatment, patients will be asked to wear an activity monitor during waking hours, the SenseWear Armband (Bodymedia &#x02013; Pittsburgh, PA, USA), which measures energy expenditure, daily number of steps, and time spent at different levels of physical activity. SenseWear-derived measurements are sensitive and repeatable in patients with chronic lung disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>].

Patient-reported use will be cross-checked by assessing accountability records provided by the relevant oxygen company, following an agreement that has been put in place.</p><p>To validate patient-reported use of oxygen cylinders, a researcher at the Aintree site will sample 10 consecutive patients living in the nearby area. The researcher will visit patients at home at the end of the 2&#x000a0;weeks of ambulatory oxygen to independently assess numbers of fully used, half-used and full oxygen cylinders. Comparison between patient- and researcher-reported cylinders use will be included in data analysis.</p><p>Patients will also be asked to fill in a daily oxygen use diary card to write down the time of use of oxygen canisters, and the activity being performed.

The interviews will explore patients&#x02019; and their informal carers&#x02019; perspectives on how the ambulatory oxygen has affected their day to day life. The interview will be conducted within 2&#x000a0;weeks of the end of treatment visit. Patients from the RBH site will be approached by a qualitative researcher at the end of treatment visit and asked if they will participate in the qualitative interview (as described in the Patient Information Sheet &#x02013; Additional file <xref rid="MOESM4" ref-type="media">4</xref>). Consent of the patient and carer will be confirmed before proceeding to the interviews at a venue convenient to the patient.</p><p>The audio-recorded, semistructured interviews will use a topic guide focussing on practical barriers to optimal oxygen usage, practical, social and psychological difficulties encountered, concerns about dependency, and views on the information required prior to ambulatory oxygen prescription. The interviews will also explore patients&#x02019; experience of participating in the trial. Field notes will be written after each interview to aid reflexive analytical processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>].

At each study visit the investigator or designee will make an assessment of safety and will specifically review the clinical history and investigation findings with regard to the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs). Details of adverse and clinical events will be captured on the trial electronic Case Report Form (eCRF).</p></sec><sec id="Sec24"><title>Blood samples</title><p>Blood samples will be taken at the start of the 4-week period to evaluate serum BNP levels.

As ambulatory oxygen is not anticipated to have any effect on disease progression in the short term, costs related to unplanned health professional appointments or hospital admissions will not be included. The primary measure of benefit for the economic evaluation will be change in K-BILD score. Quality of life benefits will also be assessed using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). QALYs will be estimated by synthesising utility values from existing medical literature for health states described by the K-BILD or SGRQ. Discounting will not be applied given the short trial duration. Cost-effectiveness will be expressed as the incremental cost per unit improvement in K-BILD and per QALY gained.</p><p>We expect that ambulatory oxygen will allow patients to lead an active and independent life for longer, with a varied set of longer-term benefits, reducing the period of dependency and expensive care packages associated with the final stages of fibrotic ILD, characterised by severely limited mobility. Therefore, future research should consider modelling the longer-term costs and benefits of ambulatory oxygen when sufficient data are available to evidence this potential benefit. The economic evaluation conducted alongside this trial will provide important preliminary guidance on the likely cost-effectiveness of implementing ambulatory oxygen in fibrotic ILD, as well as evidence to support future studies that extrapolate findings to a longer time horizon.</p></sec><sec id="Sec26"><title>Discontinuation or withdrawal of study subjects</title><p>We do not expect there to be any significant toxicity from the use of ambulatory oxygen. Subjects will be withdrawn from the trial only if they wish to do so, or if they develop an unexpected worsening in their condition which means that they require oxygen at rest. Patients withdrawing from the study will be asked, if willing and whenever possible, to fill in the relevant questionnaires at the end of the 2- and 4-week period, if needed via telephone, so as to be able to compare change in health status and other questionnaire-related outcomes, compared to baseline, against subjects completing the trial.</p></sec><sec id="Sec27"><title>Adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) reporting</title><p>AEs and SAEs will be identified according to standard criteria and will be recorded in the eCRF and reported to the sponsor.

The InForm system will be used to develop the eCRF and will be designed in accordance with the requirements of the clinical trial protocol and will comply with regulatory requirements.

Personnel will have individual log-on and passwords. It will be the investigator&#x02019;s responsibility to ensure the accuracy of all data entered and recorded in the eCRFs. Trial monitors will check the accuracy of the eCRF data against source documents. It is anticipated that the majority of source data (medical progress notes and letters, tests and investigations) will be filed in the individual patients&#x02019; medical records. Any deviation from source data being present in the medical notes will be identified and documented. The eCRF and source documents must be available at all times for review by the sponsor&#x02019;s clinical trial monitor, auditors and for inspection by the Medicines Health Regulatory Agency. The accuracy of eCRF data will be verified by review of the source documents and details will be provided in the Trial Monitoring Report.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Before starting the data analysis, the level and pattern of the missing data in the baseline variables and outcomes will be established by forming appropriate tables. The likely causes of any missing data will be investigated. This information will be used to determine whether the level and type of missing data have the potential to introduce bias into the analysis results for the proposed statistical methods, or to substantially reduce the precision of estimates related to treatment effects.</p><p>The potential effects of performance, attrition and evaluation bias associated with the lack of a placebo arm will be considered. Although we are not able to fully exclude bias in the patient-reported outcomes, this will be minimised by exploring correlations between the primary endpoint and secondary outcomes, including analysis of SenseWear Armband activity monitors, to assess the possibility that a placebo effect is associated with evaluation bias. Attrition bias should be minimised by the fact that there will be no change in dosing for the duration of the trial, and we do not expect there to be any toxicity from the use of ambulatory oxygen. Subjects will be withdrawn from the trial only if they wish to do so or because of disease progression and the development of hypoxia at rest. We do not expect there to be any bias in the background provision of care (performance bias) depending on use or not of oxygen, as patients enrolled into the trial will be those not expected to change their treatment for the duration of the study.</p><p>Although we will not adjust for baseline K-BILD score in the primary analysis, secondary analyses using the K-BILD filled in at baseline visit (week 0) as a covariate, or mean of the K-BILD score at screening visit (week &#x02212;2) and at baseline visit (week 0) will be considered.</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Primary outcome measure</title><p>

With currently available treatments providing only partial effectiveness and often, at best, stability of disease, interventions to improve day-to-day quality of life are crucial in this group of patients. This trial will be the first to prospectively assess the impact of ambulatory oxygen in patients with fibrotic ILD and to explore the outcomes for which it is most effective, the predictors of benefit and the variables/patient characteristics associated with lack of response. This study will form an essential precursor to the development of ILD-specific guidelines on ambulatory oxygen use. Ultimately, if proven to be effective and cost-effective, the appropriate prescription and use of ambulatory oxygen should lead to prolonged patient independence and mobility, allowing maintenance of fitness levels and of active roles in daily life, with increased psychological and physical wellbeing, as well as potentially reduced health-related costs.</p><sec id="Sec37"><title>Trial status</title><p>Recruitment to AmbOx began in August 2014.
