Timely provision of an ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) orthotist customized for individuals early after stroke can be problematic. <italic>Objective</italic>. To evaluate the efficacy of a therapist-made AFO (SWIFT Cast) for walking recovery. <italic>Methods</italic>. This was a randomized controlled, observer-blind trial. Participants (n = 105) were recruited 3 to 42 days poststroke. All received conventional physical therapy (CPT) that included use of &#x0201c;off-the-shelf&#x0201d; and orthotist-made AFOs. People allocated to the experimental group also received a SWIFT Cast for up to 6 weeks. Measures were undertaken before randomization, 6 weeks thereafter (outcome), and at 6 months after stroke (follow-up). The primary measure was walking speed. Clinical efficacy evaluation used analysis of covariance. <italic>Results</italic>. Use of a SWIFT Cast during CPT sessions was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic> &#x0003c; .001) for the SWIFT Cast (55%) than the CPT group (3%). The CPT group used an AFO in 26% of CPT sessions, compared with 11% for the SWIFT Cast group (<italic>P</italic> = .005). At outcome, walking speed was 0.42 (standard deviation [SD] = 0.37) m/s for the CPT group and 0.32 (SD = 0.34) m/s for the SWIFT Cast group. Follow-up walking speed was 0.53 (SD = 0.38) m/s for the CPT group and 0.43 (0.34) m/s for the SWIFT Cast group. Differences, after accounting for minimization factors, were insignificant at outcome (<italic>P</italic> = .345) and follow-up (<italic>P</italic> = .360). <italic>Conclusion and implications</italic>. SWIFT Cast did not enhance the benefit of CPT, but the control group had greater use of another AFO. However, SWIFT Cast remains a clinical option because it is low cost and custom-made by therapists who can readily adapt it during the rehabilitation period.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>rehabilitation</kwd><kwd>stroke</kwd><kwd>orthotics</kwd><kwd>physical therapy</kwd><kwd>walking</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="section1-1545968315583724"><title>Introduction</title><p>At discharge from rehabilitation, stroke survivors may only walk at 0.55 m/s, well below normal (1.2-1.4 m/s) and not even fast enough to cross a road before the pedestrian crossing lights change (0.8 m/s).<sup><xref rid="bibr1-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">1</xref></sup> Consequently, improving walking recovery is an important goal.<sup><xref rid="bibr2-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">2</xref></sup> Clinical guidelines recommend repetitive functional task training (eg, Donaldson et al<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup>), but if stroke survivors have substantial weakness, such training presents a challenge.</p><p>An ankle-foot orthosis (AFO) positions the foot in relation to the lower leg to optimize normal alignment during gait and thus improve walking performance.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The optimal type of AFO is considered to be a device customized for individuals by an orthotist.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> Obtaining this within an appropriate timescale early after stroke can be problematic in clinical practice.<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup> The device evaluated here was a SWIFT Cast, custom-made and fitted by a therapist within 24 hours. This trial was focused on the potential use of a SWIFT Cast to provide optimal alignment of the lower limb to the ground during walking.

Minimization was used with (<italic>a</italic>) ability to walk independently, as assessed by the Functional Ambulation Category (FAC; higher = 3-5 and lower = 2 or less)<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup>; (<italic>b</italic>) clinical assessment of primary motor cortex involvement in the stroke lesion (yes/no); and (<italic>c</italic>) clinical center (A/B). An independent telephone randomization service concealed group allocation until after baseline measures.</p></sec><sec id="section6-1545968315583724"><title>Interventions</title><p>All participants received CPT (treatment as usual) that included interventions designed to enhance movement performance and functional ability (supplementary material). The experimental group also received a customized SWIFT Cast (supplementary material). During CPT, the SWIFT Cast was worn for walking retraining, and participants were asked to wear the SWIFT Cast for the whole of their waking day initially. As gait improved, daily use was adjusted appropriately.</p><p>Splinting techniques, including AFOs, were used in both clinical centers.<sup><xref rid="bibr3-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">3</xref></sup> There were clinical concerns that if AFOs were not used in CPT, therapy would be suboptimal. The verbal agreement for this trial with the clinical therapists was that they would maintain their pretrial practice but that individuals allocated to the SWIFT Cast group would not receive another AFO during the intervention phase between baseline and outcome measurement time points (6 weeks). Research and clinical therapists met regularly and as needed throughout the trial to consider this. In addition, there were regular trial management meetings involving the research therapists, principle investigators, trial manager, and chief investigator. Influencing the routine interventions (CPT) provided by the clinical team was neither possible nor desirable. There are ethical and research governance frameworks that are designed to protect people from undue influence before and during their involvement in a trial.</p></sec><sec id="section7-1545968315583724"><title>Outcome Measures</title><p>The primary outcome measure was walking speed. Secondary outcome measures were the following: FAC,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> Modified Rivermead Mobility Index (MRMI),<sup><xref rid="bibr7-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">7</xref></sup> peak angular velocity of the knee,<sup><xref rid="bibr8-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">8</xref></sup> gait symmetry, and angle of the tibia with the ground during walking. Participants did not wear either a SWIFT Cast or AFO during conduction of measures. The rationale was that a SWIFT Cast was designed to enhance recovery of motor control for walking and not to compensate for its loss.</p></sec><sec id="section8-1545968315583724"><title>Sample Size</title><p>It was estimated that with a sample size of 110, the trial had 80% power at 5% significance to detect a clinical improvement of 0.13 m/s for walking speed with a standard deviation (SD) of improvement of 0.24 m/s. With this sample size, a clinical improvement of 1.1 points on the FAC, assuming a SD of 2 points, could be detected. To allow for an attrition rate of approximately 10%, the target sample was 120 participants (60 in each group).</p></sec><sec id="section9-1545968315583724"><title>Analyses</title><p>All participants were analyzed according to the group to which they were randomly allocated. The clinical efficacy analysis was carried out using analysis of covariance adjusting for the baseline values and any imbalance in factors between the 2 groups. When the assumptions of analysis of covariance were not met, a <italic>P</italic> value and 95% confidence interval were estimated using a nonparametric bootstrap with 10&#x02009;000 repetitions. All results were checked for sensitivity to missing data by imputing the data using iterative chain equations.</p><p>The total amount of CPT received was compared between the 2 treatment groups. To account for the inherent nonindependence of therapy sessions on the same individual, a random-effects model was used, with participant as the random effect. Fixed effects were the factors used to stratify randomization.</p></sec><sec id="section10-1545968315583724"><title>Trial Oversight</title><p>A favorable ethical opinion was obtained from the National Research Ethics Service (reference 09/H0310/87).

However, the use of AFOs in the CPT group was higher than expected from pretrial observations and discussion with clinical therapists. This potential confounder is discussed below. Considering the actual level of AFO use in the CPT group, the use of a SWIFT Cast early after stroke did not reduce recovery and, therefore, is possibly a clinical option for individuals early after stroke. Investigation of this possibility is warranted especially as a SWIFT Cast is different from an off-the-shelf or orthotist-made AFO. It is made from different materials, might have different properties, is custom-made by therapists who can readily adapt it during the rehabilitation period, and costs less (Condie et al<sup><xref rid="bibr4-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">4</xref></sup>).</p><p>An obvious potential confounder in this trial is that significantly more people in the control group (35.2%) used an AFO during the CPT sessions than those in the SWIFT Cast group (17.6%). Awareness that AFO provision was part of routine CPT prompted the procedure by which clinical therapists agreed verbally to maintain their pretrial practice for the control group during the data collection period in consideration of the clinical uncertainty principle and genuine equipoise. Moreover, in keeping with best research practice and as stated in the ethical application and information given to participants, it was important to minimize the influence of research on routine clinical practice. It was anticipated from pretrial observation, conversations with clinical therapists, and research evidence<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">9</xref></sup> that AFOs were used infrequently. To monitor the use of AFOs throughout the data collection period, the clinical and research therapists talked frequently. Despite these expectations and precautions, clinical provision of AFOs could be a confounding factor. Curiously, routine CPT also included use of a SWIFT Cast in 2.6% of the sessions provided for people in the control group, suggesting clerical error or that clinical therapists were &#x0201c;trying out&#x0201d; devices. In one clinical center, we were aware that the use of AFOs in CPT had probably increased and that this was related to production of some clinical guidelines.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Interestingly, the strength of research evidence for the use of AFOs early after stroke did not increase from the pretrial situation. Indeed, the clinical guidelines recommendation used C-grade evidence for &#x0201c;where the aim of treatment is to have an immediate improvement on walking speed, efficiency or gait pattern or weight bearing during stance, patients should be assessed for suitability for an AFO by an appropriately qualified health professional.&#x0201d;<sup><xref rid="bibr10-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> Unfortunately, numerical data about AFO use during CPT sessions was only available to the trial team after hard-lock of the database. In both centers, it is possible that involvement in the trial increased clinical awareness of AFOs. With hindsight, it would have been beneficial to record use of AFOs in CPT before data collection began and to have applied to the ethical committee to enable us to undertake online monitoring of clinical practice and identify any variance from pretrial use of AFOs. Whether or not we would have been granted approval for such a request is unknown.</p><p>A systematic review identified only one previous randomized trial investigating the use of an AFO/cast in the first 3 months after stroke.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> Our systematic search did not identify any subsequent randomized trials. The earlier trial also found no difference in walking speed (effect size = 0.00 [&#x02212;0.08, 0.08])<sup><xref rid="bibr9-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="bibr11-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> but did report a highly significant increase (<italic>P</italic> = .0001) in FAC score from a median of 1 (1-1) to 2 (1-2).<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> However, the earlier trial had a greater risk of potential bias than the one reported here for the following reasons: randomization was not to group but to the order of each individual using an AFO once the control walk (without AFO) had been made; observers were not masked to conditions because participants used the AFO during testing sessions; and an independent randomization service was not used. For the present trial, bias protection was also provided by adhering to the intention-to-treat principle and reporting all planned outcomes. This trial evaluated a highly visible SWIFT Cast; therefore, it was not possible to mask research therapists, participants, or clinical staff to the allocated intervention.</p><p>The 2 trials also differed in regard to the purpose of the devices and their use during outcome measures. The earlier trial evaluated the immediate effects on walking of an off-the-shelf plastic AFO to compensate for motor impairment,<sup><xref rid="bibr12-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup> whereas the present trial evaluated the potential restorative effect on motor function of using an individually fitted SWIFT Cast over a 6-week period. It is possible that had measurements been collected while wearing a SWIFT Cast, walking improvement could have been detected. However, that was not the focus of the present trial because (<italic>a</italic>) it is already known that the immediate effects are positive both early and later after stroke<sup><xref rid="bibr11-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> and (<italic>b</italic>) the focus of rehabilitation in the first 3 months after stroke is to restore function rather than compensate for its loss.<sup><xref rid="bibr13-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup></p><p>There is a possibility of differential response for subgroups of stroke survivors to the same intervention. For example, robotic gait training may be better than routine therapy for people early after stroke (mean 20 days) if they have low ability to voluntarily contract paretic muscle but not if they have high ability.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> This possibility is being tested through the indicators of response analysis of the embedded study of the present trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup></p><p>That the present trial found no difference between the groups does not generalize to all types of AFOs. For example, stroke survivors walked further and negotiated stairs faster using a dynamic AFO than a carbon-composite AFO.<sup><xref rid="bibr15-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">15</xref></sup> It is possible, therefore, that an AFO custom-made by an orthotist for individuals early after stroke would restore motor function to a higher level than CPT alone. This hypothesis requires testing.</p><p>Another possible influence on these results is that insufficient walking training was undertaken to utilize better biomechanical alignment enabled by the SWIFT Cast. Intensity of training is known to be an important principle of neural plasticity,<sup><xref rid="bibr16-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></sup> and there could be a critical threshold for efficacy.<sup><xref rid="bibr17-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">17</xref></sup> Both groups in this trial received essentially the same amount of CPT and walking training. Further investigation could determine the critical threshold for the number of stepping repetitions during walking wearing a SWIFT Cast.</p><p>The sample size for this trial was estimated by a power calculation informed by data from a group of similar stroke survivors receiving the same CPT as in this trial.<sup><xref rid="bibr18-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">18</xref></sup> However, the actual sample size was less than planned: 105 of 120 participants (87.5%). Published reports of earlier trials of lower-limb interventions early after stroke are scarce,<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup> which hinders direct comparison, but recruitment compares well with the finding that 78% of funded trials recruit to 80% of their target.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup></p><p>An important strength of the trial reported here is that, on average, participants were recruited 20.8 days after stroke. Early rehabilitation is recommended because of potential for brain reorganization.<sup><xref rid="bibr20-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">20</xref></sup> In clinical practice, the majority of rehabilitation is provided in this time period, and yet most rehabilitation trials are conducted later in recovery.<sup><xref rid="bibr19-1545968315583724" ref-type="bibr">19</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Supplementary Material</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="SD1"><caption><title>Supplementary material</title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf" xlink:href="NNR583724_Supplementary_material.pdf" orientation="portrait" id="d36e1779" position="anchor"/></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank all the stroke survivors, clinical services, and imaging facilities who agreed to participate in this research.
