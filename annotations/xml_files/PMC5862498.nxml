The objective of this integrated optimization problem changes from minimizing flight distance to minimizing flight time. In this study, the Euclidean distance between any two targets is expanded to the Dubins path length, considering the minimum turning radius of fixed-wing UAVs. According to the vector relationship between wind speed, UAV airspeed, and UAV ground speed, a method is proposed to calculate the flight time of UAV between targets. On this basis, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with the purpose of minimizing the time required for UAVs to visit all the targets and return to the starting point. By designing a crossover operator and mutation operator, the genetic algorithm is used to solve the model, the results of which show that an effective UAV task allocation and path planning solution under steady wind can be provided.</p></abstract><funding-group><award-group id="award001"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>71401048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2062-5510</contrib-id><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>He</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award002"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>71671059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xiaoxuan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="award003"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>71521001</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award004"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>71690230</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award005"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>71690235</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award006"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>71472058</award-id></award-group><award-group id="award007"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="funder-id">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003995</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Anhui Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1508085MG140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><contrib-id authenticated="true" contrib-id-type="orcid">http://orcid.org/0000-0003-2062-5510</contrib-id><name><surname>Luo</surname><given-names>He</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (71671059, 71401048, 71521001, 71690230, 71690235, 71472058) and the URL is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/">http://www.nsfc.gov.cn/</ext-link>, and the Anhui Provincial Natural Science Foundation (1508085MG140) and the URL is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://218.22.27.67/Ahzrjj/index.action">http://218.22.27.67/Ahzrjj/index.action</ext-link>.

They are able to fulfill a variety of tasks, such as target reconnaissance [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], target tracking [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], intelligence gathering [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>], post-earthquake rescue [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], and geological exploration [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. For instance, when multiple UAVs are applied to cooperative target reconnaissance, it is necessary to allocate reconnaissance targets for each UAV reasonably, and to plan optimal flight path for each UAV. This involves the integrated optimization of task allocation and path planning constrained by multiple factors [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>], which is also a NP-hard (non-deterministic polynomial-time hard) problem [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p><p>For UAVs, one of the largest disturbances in flight is wind, as it affects the flight posture [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] and flight path [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] of UAV, thus resulting in changes in flight time. In a windless environment, UAV airspeed is equivalent to UAV ground speed. However, in a windy environment, ground speed is affected by both airspeed and wind speed. Therefore, although UAV can fly along the pre-planned path in a windy environment by adjusting its flight speed and heading angle, the actual arrival time and fuel consumption will be higher than estimated [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], and the flight time will no longer be the shortest.</p><p>The integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning under steady wind can be described as follows: In a windy environment, UAVs depart from the common starting point to visit multiple targets, and each target can only be visited once by one UAV. Constrained by factors such as physical characteristics [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] of UAV, the task allocation scheme and the optimal flight path are obtained, which enable UAVs to complete all the tasks and return to the starting point in the shortest time. In this paper, based on the classical vehicle routing problem (VRP) model, a variable-speed Dubins path vehicle routing problem (VS-DP-VRP) model is established with minimum flight time as the objective function. The following two factors are taken into account in the modeling:</p><p>First, given the flight dynamics constraints of UAV, the VRP model is extended to a Dubins path VRP model (DP-VRP). When flying between different targets, UAVs are constrained by flight dynamics and must change flight direction with the minimum turning radius. Thus, the obtained flight distance is not the Euclidean distance, but rather the Dubins distance. In addition, the Euclidean distance between two targets is constant in the VRP model, but the Dubins distance between the two targets in the DP-VRP model will change with the angle when a UAV visits the target.</p><p>Second, in light of the influences caused by wind, the DP-VRP model is further extended to the VS-DP-VRP model. In the standard VRP model, the time of a vehicle moving between two targets is constant or quantitatively changes according to the traffic conditions between the two points [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. In the VS-DP-VRP model, on the other hand, because of the real-time changes in direction of UAV airspeed vector, as well as in the ground speed vector affected by both airspeed and wind speed, flight time of UAV between two targets is determined by real-time ground speed and Dubins distance between the two targets.</p><p>Currently, the heuristic algorithm is used to solve the VRP model. In particular, the genetic algorithm (GA) has been proved to be effective [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] in solving the bench mark dataset, and better results can be obtained by adjusting parameters. When solving practical problems, the GA has also been used as an efficient algorithm with which to solve the problem of task allocation and path planning [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. In most cases, it is better than other algorithms [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>] and requires shorter computation time [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In this paper, based on the GA framework, the VS-DP-VRP model is solved by designing a crossover operator and mutation operator.</p><p>The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: research related to this problem is introduced in the next section, and the VS-DP-VRP model is presented in the Section 3. Then, a GA is proposed for solving the VS-DP-VRP in Section 4. The model and algorithm are analyzed using example comparison in Section 5 and the parameter sensitivity experiment and simulation experiments are described in Section 6. Conclusions and the future prospects of this study are provided in Section 7.</p></sec><sec id="sec002"><title>Related work</title><p>When UAVs are on a mission, the impact exerted by wind cannot be ignored, especially in terms of UAV task allocation and path planning [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194690.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], because wind changes flight time and flight path [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] of UAV. At present, the modeling of wind can be divided into three ways: the first is the steady wind, which is of constant speed and direction [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]; the second is to model the wind according to the cause of wind [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], such as pressure, temperature, humidity, terrain, altitude, etc.; the third way is to estimate the status data of the current wind by analyzing historical data. Among these three methods, the steady wind is the typical one chosen for UAVs. It is believed that the speed and direction of wind influencing UAVs are constant. Aiming at UAV path planning in the steady wind, Zhang et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] took into account the impact of steady wind on flight path of UAV, and set a virtual target, then the problem became the path planning for UAV that would cost the least time to reach the virtual target in a windless environment. Techy et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] suggested linking straight and trochoidal path segments to form a feasible path and choosing the scheme that costs the least time from the result set.</p><p>Actually, when UAVs are in a steady wind, if they have a constant airspeed, their actual speed and direction are always changing relative to the ground [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>], as they are under the influence of wind. That means their ground speed is changing all the time. In this case actual flight path of UAV no longer meets the estimated result of the plan and flight time changes as well. To keep the constant ground speed of UAV, airspeed and direction must be changing constantly under steady wind according to the vector relation [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] between UAV ground speed and airspeed. Although it can be guaranteed that UAV will fly along the pre-planned route, flight time changes. Thus, in steady wind, the time UAVs require to accomplish the task does not conform to the pre-planned time, no matter which flight control strategy is adopted. Affected by the wind, the optimization objective of UAV task allocation and path planning is to minimize execution time.</p><p>At present, in terms of UAV task allocation and path planning, the travelling salesman problem (TSP) model, team orienteering problem (TOP) model, and VRP model are usually adopted for the modeling. In particular, when all targets need to be visited, the optimization is often to minimize flight path, and the TSP model can be used for modeling. For example, Sathyan et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] changed the UAV task allocation problem to the multiple travelling salesman problem (MTSP), and put forward a cluster-first approach in which each UAV is distributed to a target subset. Ernest et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>] extended the MTSP of multiple UAVs visiting multiple sites to the multi-depot polygon visiting Dubins MTSP, with a view to accounting for the constraint of UAV minimum turning radius.</p><p>However, in the case in which not all targets need be visited, the TOP model can be used to transfer the problem of the shortest flight path to the problem of maximizing profits. For example, Evers et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] established a standard orienteering problem (OP) extended model, with a view of time windows and time-sensitive targets, with the purpose of solving the UAVs task allocation problem. Considering the impact on UAV flight time caused by sensor allocation, Mufalli et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>] established a TOP model to maximize the profits. The VRP model is generally used for modeling in consideration of the time used by UAVs to visit all targets. In a study conducted by Faie et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>], a VRP model was established with minimum flight time of each UAV as the cost function. In the meantime, it was pointed out that in the cases where wind could be ignored, the minimum flight time of UAV has the same meaning as the minimum path length. Guerrero J A et al. [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] took into account the wind and UAV energy constraints, and established a capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP) model targeting time minimization.</p><p>In the VRP standard model and extended model [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], it is believed that targets and their distances are constant. However, constrained by flight dynamics like minimum turning radius, the shortest flight distance of UAV is the length of the Dubins path rather than the Euclidean distance. The Dubins path is the feasible path [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] of minimum length, which moves along a bounded curve path with a constant speed. Moreover, it is a UAV&#x02019;s shortest flight path in either a windless [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>, <xref rid="pone.0194690.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] or windy environment [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. According to the method of calculating the Dubins path [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], if the ground speed heading angles when a UAV visits two targets are equally divided into 360 parts, there are 6&#x000d7;360&#x000d7;360 = 777600&#x02248;7&#x000d7;105 solutions in the Dubins path between these two targets. Therefore, optimizing the Dubins path on the basis of optimizing the standard VRP is required.</p><p>At present, integer programming or a heuristic method is generally adopted to solve the standard or extended VRP model, but the calculation time of integer programming grows exponentially with the expansion of scale. The solution can be quickly acquired on the premise of ensuring the quality of the solution by designing a heuristic algorithm [<xref rid="pone.0194690.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].

When the population size exceeds a certain scale, the crossover and mutation probabilities still has a positive effect on the algorithm, but the influence is obviously reduced.</p><p>In order to intuitively reflect the difference of the algorithm results in different populations and for different crossover and mutation probabilities, the three configurations of crossover and mutation probabilities are selected for population sizes of 400 and 800. 20 experiments are carried out under the same experimental configurations, and the results of the average minimum time, which varies with generation, is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pone.0194690.g017">Fig 17</xref>. When the population size is 400, the results of the three configurations are significantly different, and when the crossover probability is 0.9 and the mutation probability is 0.5, the algorithm has its best performance. When the population size increased to 800, the results among the three configurations are not significant difference, especially when the generation exceeds 90. It should also be noted that smaller population size can reduce the time cost of the algorithm&#x02019;s operation at the same generation. After a comprehensive consideration of the above experimental process and results, in following experiments the crossover probability will be set to 0.9, the mutation probability to 0.5, the population size to 400, and the generation to 200.</p><fig id="pone.0194690.g017" orientation="portrait" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pone.0194690.g017</object-id><label>Fig 17</label><caption><title>Algorithm solving process when given two population sizes and three kinds of crossover and mutation probability configurations &#x0201c;Table in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pone.0194690.s003">S3 Table</xref>&#x0201d;.</title></caption><graphic xlink:href="pone.0194690.g017"/></fig><p>On this basis, the method described in Ref.

Different wind speeds and wind directions cause changes in heading angle and ground speed of UAV in actual flight. In this paper, in order to integrated optimize the task allocation and path planning of fixed-wing UAV, the steady wind environment was introduced into the optimization model, and the VS-DP-VRP model was established considering the dynamic constraints of UAV. The optimization objective of this model is to minimize the time required by UAVs to complete all of the tasks. Thus, the distance between any two targets was described by a Dubins path, and a method was proposed that combines the wind speed with the airspeed of UAV to calculate its ground speed. Considering that the VS-DP-VRP is still a NP-hard problem, the GA was chosen to solve this problem. The crossover operator in the GA and three kinds of mutation operators&#x02014;namely, the mutation of targets, ground speed heading angle number mutation, and mutation in UAV allocation&#x02014;were redesigned based on the characteristics of this problem. In addition, the feasibility and validity of the method were analyzed by an illustrative example, and the sensitivity of the influence caused by parameters such as population size, crossover probability, and mutation probability on the algorithm was analyzed. Moreover, the problem of multiple UAVs visiting multiple targets were comparatively analyzed, the results of which show that the proposed model and its algorithm can effectively provide a UAV task allocation and path planning scheme under steady wind. The wind direction and wind speed can be regarded as a steady wind as they are generally the same within a certain area. Yet changes in wind speed and wind direction cannot be ignored when the area is further expanded. In the future research, we will further consider the cases where wind speed and wind direction are constantly changing. Combined with UAV flight control strategy in variable wind, the integrated optimization of UAV task allocation and path planning under the influence of wind will be further explored.</p></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="sec016"><title>Supporting information</title><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194690.s001"><label>S1 Table</label><caption><title>Minimum time in east wind field with wind speed of 5 m/s obtained by using different population sizes and crossover and mutation probabilities.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0194690.s001.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194690.s002"><label>S2 Table</label><caption><title>Effect of crossover and mutation probabilities on the results of the algorithm under different population sizes.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0194690.s002.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material><supplementary-material content-type="local-data" id="pone.0194690.s003"><label>S3 Table</label><caption><title>Algorithm solving process when given two population sizes and three kinds of crossover and mutation probability configurations.</title><p>(XLSX)</p></caption><media xlink:href="pone.0194690.s003.xlsx"><caption><p>Click here for additional data file.</p></caption></media></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pone.0194690.ref001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Shames</surname><given-names>I</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Fidan</surname><given-names>B</given-names></name>, <name><surname>Anderson</surname><given-names>B D O</given-names></name>. <article-title>Close Target Reconnaissance Using Autonomous UAV Formations</article-title>. <source>IEEE Conference on Decision and Control</source>. <year>2008</year>:<fpage>1729</fpage>&#x02013;<lpage>1734</lpage>.</mixed-citation></ref><ref id="pone.0194690.ref002"><label>2</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal"><name><surname>Quintero</surname><given-names>S.
