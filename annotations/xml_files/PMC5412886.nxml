Registration of children with SAC took place from July 2015 through November 2015 in our study.

Moreover, they were asked whether, in their living environment, there were pets or not; and whether they had done allergen detection (especially plant, pollen, dust mites, and animal dander) in the past or not. Furthermore, naked VA and the best corrected VA were measured carefully, VA was observed through the international standard E vision table and all the children used the same VA chart. In addition, ocular signs were tested through slit lamp examination. Fundus preset lens was also through the slit lamp. Ocular symptoms were evaluated through query direct of the children by the investigator. All the inspections were completed by the same operator. The investigator was blinded to what ophthalmic solution the children were taking upon their treatment.

</p><p>The novelty of the present trial lies in that it is the first time the efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1%, emedastine difumarate 0.05%, and LE 0.5% ophthalmic suspension has been compared among the 3 drugs.

Emedastine difumarate 0.05% has been compared with vehicle to assess efficacy.<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> In addition, LE 0.5% ophthalmic suspension has been compared with placebo to evaluate efficacy.<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0017" ref-type="ref">17</xref> However, emedastine difumarate 0.05% and LE 0.5% ophthalmic suspension have not been compared with each other, while on that basis we put forward with these 2 eye drops compared to olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1%, respectively.</p><p>After the treatment, ocular signs and symptoms that appeared in our study may be related to the following reasons: (1) in this trial the control group was AT, some of which offered alleviation through lubricating the ocular surface and raised humidity or glutinosity factors to salt solution<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0025" ref-type="ref">25</xref>; (2) AT may improve the barrier function of the ocular surface,<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0026" ref-type="ref">26</xref> which is useful in the treatment of SAC<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref>; (3) compliance of guardians/parents and children was good&#x02014;they very strictly used the ophthalmic solution according to the requirements. Hence the efficacy of the treatment came out.</p><p>In the current study, compared with emedastine difumarate 0.05%, olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% did not show a statistically significant difference (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) in suppressing the symptoms and signs of SAC and it was consistent with the conclusion obtained by Borazan et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>
</p><p>Olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% solution displayed no obvious superiority when compared to LE 0.5% ophthalmic suspension, which was in agreement with Gong et&#x000a0;al.,<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0014" ref-type="ref">14</xref> who reported that LE ophthalmic suspension 0.5% compared with olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% was inferior in 300 patients. On the contrary, Berdy et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0028" ref-type="ref">28</xref> reported that olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% was superior to LE hydrochloride 0.5% in the alleviation of ocular itch and ocular hyperemia.</p><p>In relief of the symptoms and signs of SAC, olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution compared with vehicle, the difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). Our study was consistent with that of McLaurin et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0023" ref-type="ref">23</xref> and Mah et&#x000a0;al.,<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0029" ref-type="ref">29</xref> who reported how olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution compared with placebo. In their reports, olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution was more effective in reducing ocular symptoms and signs of patients suffering from AC. The results of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% ophthalmic solution compared with placebo may be that the control agent was AT, though it may water down the allergen from eyes and serve as a barrier to additional exposure by keeping the allergen from adhesion to the ocular surface,<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref> whereas olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% is a dual&#x02010;action agent.</p><p>In the current study, emedastine difumarate 0.05% was superior to vehicle in releasing the symptoms and signs of SAC and the differences were significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). In a previous study, Borazan et&#x000a0;al.<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref> compared the efficacy of emedastine difumarate 0.05% with placebo and highlighted that emedastine difumarate 0.05% was more effective than placebo in offering rapid relief to patients with SAC.</p><p>As for the comparison of LE hydrochloride 0.5% and vehicle, the difference was statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003c; 0.05). LE hydrochloride 0.5% has been demonstrated to be more effective than placebo in the treatment of SAC in an earlier study.<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>
</p><p>In the present study, emedastine difumarate 0.05% was equally effective with LE hydrochloride 0.5% (<italic>p</italic> &#x0003e; 0.05) in suppressing the clinical symptoms and signs of SAC. Since this was the first time comparing them with each other, the sample size was small, with only 20 cases in each group, and the study was confined to children 5 to 10 years old, it was confirmed that emedastine and LE had no statistically significant difference in a small sample case&#x02010;series research study.</p><p>The reasons of the study are as follows: olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1% is a dual&#x02010;action agent; emedastine difumarate 0.05% is a H&#x02010;1 receptor antagonist; LE suspension 0.5% is a new C&#x02010;20 ester drug, transforming into inactive metabolites, in this case the side effect is small<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0030" ref-type="ref">30</xref>; and AT may water down the allergen from eyes and serve as a barrier for additional exposure through keeping the allergen from adhering to the ocular surface.<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> In addition, the observation in the study lasts 2 weeks, which is relatively short. It is still required a long&#x02010;term observation to provide a new theoretical support in the clinical study to make more patients to alleviate the pain suffering from SAC.</p><p>We have not performed conjunctival impression cytology in the study, which is a limitation of our research. Some studies have done biomicroscopy,<xref rid="alr21882-bib-0013" ref-type="ref">13</xref>, <xref rid="alr21882-bib-0027" ref-type="ref">27</xref> especially in the recent literature. Conjunctival cytology may find eosinophils, basophils, as well as mast cells, while it will receive negative results inevitably.</p><p>On the other hand, we also take the tolerability and acceptance of children and guardians into consideration. In particular, the subjects are 5 to 10 years old, which makes it inevitable for them to have fears.</p><p>Among the 80&#x02010;patient case study we conducted, our conclusion was relatively limited to the drug use of children; besides, the compliance of children is usually poor. It confirmed that olopatadine, emedastine, and LE were equally effective only in a small sample of children. As far as we all know, this is the first time in the comparison of three drugs, so it is still necessary for a long&#x02010;term observation in a further large sample with antiallergic drugs, and taking the adults as the subjects should be performed in the further clinical studies to certificate and validate this research.</p></sec><sec id="alr21882-sec-0180"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In summary, the efficacy of olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1%, emedastine difumarate 0.05%, and LE suspension 0.5% was equal, and olopatadine hydrochloride 0.1%, emedastine difumarate 0.05%, and LE suspension 0.5% were more effective than vehicle. We expect the present study will be beneficial to clinical research and will be illuminating for ophthalmologists when selecting an appropriate ophthalmic solution in SAC.</p></sec></body><back><ref-list id="alr21882-bibl-0001"><title>References</title><ref id="alr21882-bib-0001"><label>1</label><mixed-citation publication-type="journal" id="alr21882-cit-0002">
