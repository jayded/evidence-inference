Introduction</title><p>Polymer-based drug-eluting (everolimus, zotarolimus, sirolimus, paclitaxel, etc.) stents (DES) have been known as a standard treatment for coronary artery diseases (CAD) undergoing percutaneous coronary angioplasties. Although DES has demonstrated efficacy and safety in clinical studies, human pathological data have raised concerns about the long-term healing and the potential for local inflammatory reactions [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>, <xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Also, it has been reported that DES induced hypersensitivity reactions with interacting lymphocytes, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells, and eosinophils and pervasive inflammation throughout the stented arterial segment by autopsy [<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. DES-induced inflammatory reaction has been found as early as 30 days after implantation but progressed in frequency and severity through 90 to 180 days in porcine model [<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Furthermore, our previous studies found that DES implantation induced specific systematic inflammatory state, as evidenced by the enhanced NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B activity, suppressed PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> activity, and elevated plasma inflammatory factors, compared with no-stent implantation or bare metal stent (BMS) implantation [<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. However, how to refine DES-induced proinflammation remains unknown.</p><p>In vascular wall and atherosclerosis, PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> is expressed in macrophages, T cells, endothelial cells, and vascular smooth muscle cells [<xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>, <xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Recent data have shown that synthetic antidiabetic thiazolidinediones (TZDs), which are known as PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> activators, inhibit inflammatory cytokine production by cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage [<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. These activators inhibit gene expression in part by antagonizing the activities of transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B (NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B) [<xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>, <xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Several animal studies have demonstrated the antiatherogenic effects of TZDs [<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>, <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. Moreover, pioglitazone (PIO) significantly decreased the occurrence of all-cause mortality, nonfatal myocardial infarction, and stroke in diabetic populations in the Prospective Pioglitazone Clinical Trial in Macrovascular Events (PROactive) [<xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] and in a meta-analysis study [<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. However, a meta-analysis of rosiglitazone trials in diabetic patients showed that rosiglitazone was associated with increased myocardial infarction and cardiovascular death [<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In an animal study, PIO was found to increase macrophage apoptosis and plaque necrosis in advanced lesions in LDLr-deficient mice [<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Another animal study found that pioglitazone could induce excessive hepatic triglyceride accumulation and increase the plasma cholesterol [<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>].</p><p>These conflicting and controversial findings highlight the uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of using TZDs to treat atherothrombotic disease. Whether PIO have atheroprotective effects in DES-treated CAD patients remains unknown. Here, we performed a random single-blind placebo controlled clinical study to investigate whether PIO have anti-inflammatory effects in DES-implanted coronary artery disease patients.</p></sec><sec id="sec2"><title>2. Methods</title><sec id="sec2.1"><title>2.1. Patients and Study Design</title><p>All subjects were consecutively recruited from the First Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University. 28 nondiabetic patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) and who underwent DES implantations were randomized into two groups: placebo group (Con, <italic>n</italic> = 14) and pioglitazone group (PIO, <italic>n</italic> = 14). The nondiabetic state was determined by a negative history of diabetes mellitus, no treatment with antidiabetic drugs, and assessment of fasting blood glucose and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). The diagnosis of CAD was in accorded with the WHO definition. The exclusion criteria included clinical evidence of acute inflammation, tumor and rheumatic condition checked by the elevated CRP and ESR, liver and renal diseases, severe heart failure (NYHA class &#x02265; II), ejection fraction (EF) &#x0003c; 50%, contraindications to treatment with pioglitazone, and patients who were given immunosuppressants. <xref ref-type="table" rid="tab1"> Table 1</xref> summarized all subjects' demographic data.

Considering the unchanged BMI, weight, waist to hip ratio, NT-pro BNP, and EF between two groups, there was no evidence of PIO increasing the occurrence of heart failure in the present study.

Discussion</title><p>The present study clearly showed that the circulating inflammatory responses were increased after the implantation of DES in the CAD patients treated with optimal drug combinations, which were blocked by addition of oral pioglitazone. PIO sequentially acts through PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> activation, NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B blockade, and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine expressions. These findings suggested that PIO may have a novel direct protective role in modulating the proinflammatory responses after coronary DES implantation in CAD patients, thus providing further optimizations of the drug therapy in those patients.</p><p>Vascular inflammation is recognized as the foundation mechanism of atherosclerosis, and proinflammatory mediators including IL-6, TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic>, and MMP-9 play a pivotal role in atherosclerosis [<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. IL-6 and TNF-<italic>&#x003b1;</italic> are classic proinflammatory cytokines, which play key roles in vascular disease [<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Excessive degradation and remodeling of the extracellular matrix, a promoter of the instability of plaques, are the major effect of matrix metalloproteinases (such as MMP-9) [<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. DESs left target vascular intima partially unendothelialized for a sustaining period [<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], resulting in intensely inflammation-arousing vessel segments, which may facilitate the release of multiple proinflammatory factors into serum and then proinflammation.</p><p>It has been reported that PIO may exhibit several antiatherosclerotic effects through multiple mechanisms, including modulation of blood pressure, lipid concentrations, matrix remodeling activation of matrix proteases, and finally induction of inflammation [<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. In the present study, we failed to observe a reduction of blood pressure, blood glucose, insulin, or HbA1c levels in both groups. Firstly, the unchangeable blood pressure and other metabolic parameters may be explained as follows: first, the blood pressure of all subjects was already under control by optimal treatment and the patients included in this study were all nondiabetics. Moreover, it has been reported that PIO treatment had no significant effect on the level of total cholesterol, LDL, and HDL. The improved lipid profile and hs-CRP are mainly attributed to the standard drug therapy.</p><p>Herein, we found a novel mechanism that PIO enhance PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> binding activity though inhibiting its ubiquitination and degradation, which may play a key role in PPAR function in vivo [<xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>].</p><p>Taken together, our study demonstrated that PIO treatment attenuated the proinflammatory state in circulating MNCs; and our results suggest that PIO treatment may sequentially act through PPAR-<italic>&#x003b3;</italic> activation, blocking of NF-<italic>&#x003ba;</italic>B activation, and inhibition of inflammatory cytokine expressions. These findings suggest that PIO may have a novel direct atheroprotective role by modulating the local and circulating proinflammatory responses in patients with coronary polymer-based drug-eluting stent implantation.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>The authors thank Professor Nanping Wang and Yue Wu for their thoughtful suggestions.
