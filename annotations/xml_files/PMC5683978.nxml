Study Overview</title><p>The phase 3 ustekinumab development program for CD comprised of two 8-week induction studies (UNITI-1 [NCT01369329] and UNITI-2 [NCT01369342]) and one 44-week randomized withdrawal (of ustekinumab-induction responders) maintenance study (IM-UNITI [NCT01369355]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>). The details on the UNITI-1, UNITI-2, and IM-UNITI study designs have been described elsewhere.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> All the 3 studies were multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, and were conducted between July 2011 and June 2015 in various countries, including Japan (13 sites for UNITI-1 and 16 sites for UNITI-2, with subjects from 20 sites continuing to participate in IM-UNITI).</p><p>Patients who were &#x02265;18 years of age with &#x02265;3 months of CD with a CDAI score of 220 to 450 were eligible for induction studies. In UNITI-1 study, patients were required to have had primary or secondary nonresponse or intolerance to &#x02265;1 TNF antagonists. In UNITI-2, patients were required to have failed conventional therapy, and they could have undergone TNF antagonist(s) therapy but should not have demonstrated a primary or secondary nonresponse or intolerance. Treatment with immunosuppressants, mesalamine, antibiotics, and/or oral corticosteroids (prednisone &#x02264;40 mg/day or budesonide &#x02264;9 mg/day) at stable doses was permitted. Patients previously treated with IL-12 or IL-23-antagonists were excluded. Patients with Crohn's complications anticipated to require surgical treatment or that could impede the assessment of treatment response using CDAI, active tuberculosis, and other infections or history of cancer were also excluded. Eligible patients in both induction studies were randomized to receive a single IV dose of placebo or ustekinumab (130 mg dose) or a weight-based dose of ustekinumab approximating 6 mg/kg (260 mg [weight &#x02264;55 kg], 390 mg [weight &#x0003e;55 kg and &#x02264;85 kg], or 520 mg [weight &#x0003e;85 kg]) at baseline (week 0).</p><p>Patients who responded to ustekinumab IV at week 8 in either of the induction studies were eligible to enter the 44-week maintenance study (IM-UNITI) as the primary (randomized) population. These patients underwent randomized withdrawal, receiving SC administration of either placebo or 1 of 2 ustekinumab maintenance regimens (ustekinumab 90 mg every 12 weeks [q12w] or ustekinumab 90 mg every 8 weeks [q8w]). Patients who did not show a clinical response to ustekinumab induction and all placebo-treated patients were eligible to enter IM-UNITI but were not included in the primary population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).</p><p>In all 3 studies, randomization was performed centrally using permuted blocks. Stratification variables in both induction studies included study region, CDAI score (&#x02264;300 or &#x0003e;300), and presence/absence of initial response to TNF-antagonist therapy (only in UNITI-1). In IM-UNITI, stratification variables included ustekinumab induction dose received and remission status at maintenance baseline (week 0).</p><p>The independent ethics committee or institutional review board at each study site approved study protocols. All 3 studies were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practices, and applicable regulatory requirements. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients prior to enrollment.</p></sec><sec><title>2. Study Assessments</title><p>The CDAI scores and CRP concentrations were evaluated at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 8 in the induction studies and every 4 weeks in the maintenance study. Fecal calprotectin and lactoferrin concentrations were evaluated at weeks 0 and 6 during induction and at weeks 8, 24, and 44 during maintenance. Safety assessments were performed throughout the study, which included monitoring of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and vital signs and clinical laboratory evaluations.</p><p>Additionally, serum ustekinumab concentrations were measured using a validated electrochemiluminescent immunoassay method at weeks 0, 3, 6, and 8 during induction and every 4 weeks during maintenance. Antibodies against ustekinumab were evaluated using drug-tolerant electrochemiluminescent assay at weeks 0 and 6 during induction and at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 44 during maintenance.</p></sec><sec><title>3. Study Endpoints</title><sec><title>1) Induction Studies</title><p>The primary endpoint was clinical response (defined as a reduction from baseline in CDAI score &#x02265;100) at week 6. Patients with a baseline CDAI score between 220 and 248 were considered to show a clinical response if a CDAI score of &#x0003c;150 was attained. The major secondary endpoints were clinical remission at week 8 (defined as a CDAI score of &#x0003c;150), clinical response at week 8, and 70-point response (defined as a reduction from baseline in the CDAI score of &#x02265;70) at weeks 3 and 6.</p></sec><sec><title>2) Maintenance Study</title><p>The primary endpoint was clinical remission at week 44 (defined as a CDAI score of &#x0003c;150).

Statistical Analyses</title><p>Statistical analyses for the overall study population have been described elsewhere.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In both induction and maintenance studies, comparisons of primary and secondary endpoints between ustekinumab and placebo for the overall study population were performed using Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel chi-square test at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. To control the overall Type 1 error rate, the primary endpoint and major secondary endpoints were tested in a hierarchical order. Subsequent endpoints were considered statistically significant only if the preceding endpoint in the hierarchy was positive. Patients with treatment failure (i.e., CD-related surgeries, prohibited changes to concomitant CD medications, initiation of prohibited medications), or insufficient data to calculate CDAI scores (i.e., &#x0003c;4 of 8 CDAI components available) were considered unresponsive or not in remission. For maintenance, patients who had a loss of response or discontinued study agent due to lack of therapeutic effect or an adverse event of worsening disease were also considered as treatment failures. Treatment-failure and missing data rules were also applied for dichotomous secondary endpoints. For continuous endpoints, baseline values (from induction week 0) were assigned from time of the treatment failure, and the last available observation was carried forward for missing data. The sample size for Japanese subpopulation was determined with reference to the guidance from Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare.<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref><xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref> The results of the Japanese subpopulation analysis were summarized descriptively, and consistency in efficacy and safety outcomes between the Japanese subpopulation and overall population were evaluated.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><sec><title>1.

In UNITI-2, of the 628 patients randomized, 26 were from Japan (placebo, 9; ustekinumab 130 mg, 8; ustekinumab ~6 mg/kg, 9). A total of 397 patients, including 21 patients from Japan, responded to ustekinumab treatment in induction studies and were enrolled in IM-UNITI as the primary (randomized) population (placebo, 4; ustekinumab 90 mg SC q8w group, 9; ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w group, 8). A total of 884 (Japan 53) patients who were nonresponders to ustekinumab or placebo or who were responders to placebo entered IM-UNITI as a nonrandomized population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1</xref>).

Safety</title><p>In the combined Japanese subpopulations of both induction studies, TEAEs were reported in 44.4% of patients receiving ustekinumab (130 mg), 50.0% in the ~6 mg/kg group, and 55.6% in the placebo group. A consistent pattern was observed in the overall study population (ustekinumab 130 mg, 58.4%; ~6 mg, 60.4%; placebo, 60.5%) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>). The most frequently reported TEAEs (&#x0003e;2 patients in ustekinumab groups) in the Japanese subpopulation of induction studies were nasopharyngitis (n=6, 10.9%) and pyrexia (n=3, 5.5%). Similarly, in the overall population, TEAEs of nasopharyngitis (4.6%) and pyrexia (5.9%) were commonly reported. The incidence of infection TEAEs was similar across the treatment groups in Japanese patients (ustekinumab 130 mg, 18.5%; ~6 mg/kg, 25.0%; placebo, 22.2%) and none of these were serious infections. The proportion of overall serious TEAEs in the induction studies was also not higher following ustekinumab treatment and occurred at similar frequencies in the Japanese subpopulation (both ustekinumab doses, 3.6%; placebo, 7.4%) and the overall study population (both ustekinumab doses, 5.1%; placebo, 6.0%). One patient in the placebo group experienced a TEAE leading to study drug discontinuation (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>In the IM-UNITI maintenance study, TEAEs occurred at similar frequencies across the treatment groups in both the Japanese subpopulation and the overall study population (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>). The most frequently reported TEAEs (&#x0003e;2 patients in ustekinumab groups) in the Japanese subpopulation were nasopharyngitis (n=6, 35.3%) and headache (n=4, 23.5%). The other infections observed in &#x02265;2 Japanese patients in maintenance were anal abscess, pharyngitis, and vulvovaginal candidiasis (n=2, 11.8%; each), and this was similar to the values for the overall study populations. A total of 3 serious TEAEs (q12w, n=2; q8w, n=1) were observed in the ustekinumab group within the Japanese subpopulation. Two of these were serious infections (anal abscess and bacteremia) observed in the 90 mg SC q12w group. The serious TEAE of anal abscess was the only adverse event leading to discontinuation of the study agent (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).</p><p>There were no deaths, malignancies, events of tuberculosis, or opportunistic infections reported in the Japanese subpopulation through 52 weeks of therapy. None of the Japanese patients in the ustekinumab group reported any TEAEs related to infusions in the induction or maintenance studies.</p></sec><sec><title>5. Pharmacokinetics and Immunogenicity</title><p>No clear difference in serum ustekinumab concentrations was observed between Japanese patients and non-Japanese patients in the induction studies or the maintenance study, regardless of the dose received (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S6">Supplementary Figs 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="S7">7</xref>). In the overall population, 2 patients who received ustekinumab (130 mg) IV developed antibodies to ustekinumab in the induction studies and 27 patients (2.3%) developed antibodies in the maintenance study, determined using a drug tolerant assay. None of the Japanese patients who received ustekinumab developed antibodies to ustekinumab in the induction studies and 2 Japanese patients (9.5%) developed antibodies in the maintenance study.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>Genetic variations that may increase predisposition to CD or affect treatment responses among ethnic populations have been reported. For example, there are certain coding variants in nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2 (<italic>NOD2</italic>) that have a large effect on IBD risk in Caucasians; however, such variants in allele frequency in Asian populations, including Japanese population, is absent, which suggests that there is genetic heterogeneity in predisposition to CD.<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref><xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref> Furthermore, the treatment effect of thiopurine may differ between Asians and Caucasians because of the prevalence of a variant in <italic>NUDT15</italic>, which is associated with thiopurine-induced leukopenia in patients with IBD.<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> Because differences in IBD treatment responses among ethnic populations are possible due to genetic heterogeneity,<xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> it is important to assess the consistency or difference of treatment outcomes between specific ethnic populations and overall population.</p><p>The phase 3 global clinical study program of ustekinumab studied efficacy and safety in a wide range of patients with moderately to severely active CD who had been previously treated with TNF-antagonists or conventional therapy.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In the Japanese subpopulation of this phase 3 program, ustekinumab 130 mg and ~6 mg/kg IV induction therapy showed increased clinical response rates at week 6 over placebo, both among patients who were refractory to TNF-antagonists as well as to conventional therapy. Among patients who responded to IV ustekinumab in the induction studies, treatment with SC ustekinumab (90 mg q12w and q8w) maintenance therapy demonstrated increased rates of clinical remission and response at week 44.</p><p>The primary and major secondary efficacy outcomes in induction and maintenance studies observed in the Japanese subpopulation were consistent with the findings observed in the overall global study population.<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> In both induction studies, ~6 mg/kg ustekinumab showed higher rates of clinical response and remission than 130 mg dose, particularly at week 8. Patients in the UNITI-2 study who had failed responses only to conventional therapy achieved higher rates of response and remission than the patients with failed responses to TNF-antagonist in the UNITI-1 study, possibly because these patients had a less refractory disease. Similar to the overall study population, in the Japanese subpopulation treated with ustekinumab, induction demonstrated greater reductions in CRP concentration than the placebo even at the first post-baseline visit at week 3. Reductions in fecal calprotectin levels were observed only with 130 mg ustekinumab treatment in UNITI-1 study and ~6 mg/kg ustekinumab treatment in UNITI-2 study in the Japanese subpopulation; whereas in the overall study population, both doses of ustekinumab showed reductions in fecal calprotectin and ~6 mg ustekinumab dose showed the highest reduction in both studies. This may be due to high variability in calprotectin levels and limited number of Japanese patients. However, overall treatment with ustekinumab improved objective markers of inflammation along with improvements in clinical response and remission in the Japanese subpopulation similar to the overall study population.</p><p>In the maintenance study, in Japanese patients who responded to IV ustekinumab induction, treatment with SC ustekinumab (90 mg q12w and q8w) maintained clinical remission, clinical response, remission among those in remission after induction, and corticosteroid-free remission as well as sustained remission. Although both doses of SC ustekinumab (90 mg q12w and q8w) demonstrated improvement in clinical outcomes, q8w dose showed the highest improvement in both the Japanese and overall populations. In Japanese patients who had elevated CRP concentration (&#x0003e;3 mg/L) at baseline of induction studies, treatment with ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w normalized CRP levels at week 44. A considerable reduction in fecal calprotectin levels at week 44 was also observed with ustekinumab maintenance regimens in the Japanese subpopulation. Japanese patients who were nonresponders to IV ustekinumab during induction (nonrandomized patients) also showed greater response during the additional maintenance ustekinumab SC treatment, which corroborated the results of the overall study population as well as results in the randomized primary population.</p><p>Ustekinumab IV induction and SC maintenance regimens were well tolerated in the Japanese subpopulation and in the overall study population. The rates of TEAEs and serious TEAEs were similar across the treatment groups. There were no reports of serious infections with ustekinumab IV treatment during induction in the Japanese subpopulation; whereas only 2 patients reported serious infections with ustekinumab 90 mg SC q12w during maintenance. Treatment with ustekinumab was associated with only one TEAE leading to treatment discontinuation. Additionally, there were no reports of infusion reactions, and no deaths were reported in these studies through week 44, in either the Japanese or overall populations. Overall, ustekinumab treatment showed no safety concerns and results were consistent with those for the overall study population as well as for those with the previous studies conducted in CD patients<xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref> and with previous long-term studies conducted for other indications, including psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis.<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref><xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">25</xref><xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">26</xref><xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">27</xref> No clear difference in serum ustekinumab concentrations was observed between the Japanese patients and non-Japanese patients in induction studies or the maintenance study.</p><p>The sample size in this Japanese subpopulation analysis was small to perform statistical analysis; however, efficacy and safety outcomes in Japanese patients were analogous to the results of global population.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, this is the first global IBD study to demonstrate findings of the Japanese subpopulation consistent to that of the overall study population. The IV ustekinumab as an induction therapy was more effective than placebo in Japanese patients with moderate to severely active CD, who were refractory to either TNF antagonists or conventional therapy. Among the responders to IV ustekinumab induction, treatment with SC ustekinumab was also more effective than placebo in maintaining clinical response and remission along with other efficacy outcomes. Both ustekinumab induction and maintenance regimens were generally well tolerated. Despite genetic variations that may exist in the Japanese population, these data suggest that ustekinumab provides efficacy in Japanese patients with CD, similar to observations in the global population. Ustekinumab treatment exhibits a favorable benefit-risk balance for CD; therefore, it could be considered as a new therapeutic option for moderate to severely active CD in Japanese patients who have failed conventional therapies or have additionally previously failed TNF antagonists.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS</title><p>The authors thank the study participants without whom this study would never have been accomplished and also thank the investigators for their participation in the study.
