Some long-term intubation-related complications are caused by inappropriate cuff pressure (<italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>), and include microaspiration, and tracheal ischemic lesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Microaspiration of contaminated oropharyngeal secretions is the main route of entry for bacteria into the lower respiratory tract [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR5">5</xref>]. Colonization of the lower respiratory tract could progress into ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) when local or general defense mechanisms are altered in intubated critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR6">6</xref>]. VAP is the most frequent infection acquired in the ICU and is associated with high morbidity and mortality, especially in patients with comorbidities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Tracheal ischemic injury is also associated with high morbidity, especially when routine care for tracheal cuff is not adequately provided [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>].</p><p>Based on international recommendations, <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> should be kept between 20 and 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O using a manometer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. However, several recent studies suggested that a noncontinuous control of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> using a manometer is not effective in intubated critically ill patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Further, previous studies did not identify modifiable risk factors for overinflation or underinflation of tracheal cuff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR15">15</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Recently, several devices allowing continuous control of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> were evaluated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. These devices are classified into pneumatic (i.e., does not require power supply, but a single-use 200-ml cylindrical cuff) and electronic devices (requiring power supply). Two prospective randomized controlled animal and human studies first validated the use of a pneumatic device [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. A noncommercially available device has also been validated and proved to be efficient in continuously controlling <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> in ICU patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>]. However, other commercially available automated devices were only validated in in vitro studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>]. Recent data suggest that these devices interfere with the self-sealing characteristics of high-volume low-pressure (HVLP) tracheal cuffs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>]. Further, these electronic devices have been shown to be less efficient than the pneumatic device in continuous control of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>, because of rapid correction of overinflation episodes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>A new mechanical device with an improved design aiming at continuously controlling <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> has been commercialized (PressureEasy&#x000ae;, Smiths medical). The advantages of using such device are its small size and lower cost compared with other devices. However, to our knowledge, no study has evaluated the efficiency of this device in controlling <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>. Therefore, we conducted this prospective randomized cross-over study to determine the efficiency of this device in continuously controlling <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>. Our hypothesis was that this mechanical device would allow significant reduction of time spent with underinflation or overinflation of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>, compared with routine care, using a manual manometer.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="Sec3"><title>Ethical aspects</title><p>This prospective randomized controlled study was performed in a 16-bed ICU of the teaching hospital of Sabadell (Spain), from April 2014 to July 2014.

No significant difference was found between continuous control of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> using the mechanical device and routine care regarding <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>, percentage of time spent with underinflation of tracheal cuff, and coefficient of variation of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>. However, the percentage of time spent with overinflation of tracheal cuff was significantly higher during continuous control compared with routine care.</p><p>One potential explanation for this result is the high frequency of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> control using the manometer, i.e., every 4&#x000a0;h, during routine care. A recent prospective study performed in a cohort of 102 patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and manual control of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> using a manometer every 8&#x000a0;h found a lower percentage of time (18&#x000a0;%) spent within the target range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. However, this explanation is unlikely because our results are in agreement with those of another recent trial, in which <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> was controlled using a manometer every 8&#x000a0;h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Further, previous studies showed that each time a manometer is connected to the tracheal cuff, a sudden drop of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. This is probably related to transient underinflation of tracheal cuff and might promote microaspiration of contaminated secretions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>]. Therefore, controlling <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> more frequently in order to maintain it within the target range could probably not be recommended.</p><p>In spite of strictly applying instructions for user of the mechanical device, the percentage of time spent within the target range of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> was only 34&#x000a0;%. Previous studies using different devices to continuously control <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> reported better performances and a percentage within the targeted range &#x0003e;90&#x000a0;% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. Another potential explanation for the low efficiency of the device is the mechanism of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> control. This device uses the respiratory flow to inflate tracheal cuff during inspiration. Therefore, it is dependent on respiratory flow and airway pressure that may widely vary in critically ill patients. In addition, the key principle is probably an equilibrium between airway pressure and <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>, which means that the time constant of the system might play a role in the higher <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR30">30</xref>]. Further, the exact <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> target, using the mechanical device, could not be precisely determined or modified. In order to test the hypothesis that our results could be explained by the bad performance of the device in patients with high airway pressures, we repeated all statistical analyses after exclusion of patients with the highest mean airway pressure but found similar results. This might be explained by the fact that high airway pressure could have occurred during only a short period of the total recording time and the relatively small number of included patients.</p><p>To our knowledge, our study is the first to evaluate the PressureEasy&#x000ae; mechanical device, and its results suggest that the device should not be used in critically ill patients. Our study also raises the important question of why medical devices such as tracheal tubes or <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> controllers could obtain the <italic>Communaut&#x000e9; Europ&#x000e9;enne</italic> (CE) mark and be used in critically ill patients without any published clinical data proving their efficiency. Nevertheless, clinical evaluation before CE mark could be very complex and might reduce the development of new technologies.</p><p>No significant difference was found in coefficient of variation of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> between the two study periods. However, <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> variation in study patients was relatively small and had probably no clinical impact, except in those patients with <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> around 20 or 30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O.</p><p>Some limitations of our study should be acknowledged. First, this was a single-center study. All study patients received assist-control ventilation, and a high proportion of them were sedated. Therefore, our results may not be generalized to patients in other ICUs, especially to nonsedated patients receiving pressure support ventilation. Second, the number of studied patients was relatively small. However, <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> was continuously recorded for 48&#x000a0;h. In addition, the number of included patients was calculated based on our hypothesis before starting the study. Third, because of the study design, namely the fact that every patient was its own control, we could not evaluate complications related to underinflation or overinflation of tracheal cuff. However, we think that this design is probably optimal as a first step in order to validate the device, before performing larger studies evaluating its impact on complications. Our study design allowed adjustment of patient-related confounding factors, such as tracheal anatomy, tracheal tube size, and airway pressure. Fourth, we excluded patients who could not be included during the first 48&#x000a0;h of their invasive mechanical ventilation. This exclusion criterion was selected because duration of intubation was identified as a risk factor for underinflation of tracheal cuff [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Fifth, we did not collect <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> values obtained manually during the routine care period and did not evaluate the relationship between manometer connection and any drop in <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub>. However, several previous well-designed and performed studies have clearly confirmed this relationship [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>]. Finally, Glascow Coma score was used to evaluate consciousness in study patients. However, a sedation score would have been more appropriate in sedated patients.</p></sec><sec id="Sec17" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The PressureEasy&#x000ae; device did not demonstrate a better control of <italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub> within the target range (20&#x02013;30 cmH<sub>2</sub>O), compared with routine care using a manometer every 4&#x000a0;h. Moreover, the percentage of time spent with overinflation of tracheal cuff was more frequent using this device compared with routine care, which might increase the risk for tracheal ischemic lesions. Therefore, the use of this device could not be recommended in critically ill patients. Further large studies are required to confirm our results.</p></sec></body><back><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>CE</term><def><p>Communaut&#x000e9; Europ&#x000e9;ene</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>HPLV</term><def><p>high-volume low-pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term><italic>P</italic><sub>cuff</sub></term><def><p>cuff pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PEP</term><def><p>positive expiratory pressure</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SAPS</term><def><p>simplified acute physiology score</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>SOFA</term><def><p>sequential organ failure assessment</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>PVC</term><def><p>polyvinyl chloride</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><fn-group><fn><p><bold>Competing interests</bold></p><p>SN is a member of the advisory board in Covidien.
