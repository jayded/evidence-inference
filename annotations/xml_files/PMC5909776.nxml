This study aimed to design and implement an empowerment educational intervention to prevent elder abuse.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>This parallel randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2014&#x02013;2016 for 18 months on 464 older adults aged above 60 years who visited health houses of 22 municipalities in Tehran. Data were collected using standard questionnaires, including the Elder Abuse-Knowledge Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Behavior Questionnaire, Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile II, Barriers to Healthy Lifestyle, Perceived Social Support, Perceived Self-Efficacy, Loneliness Scale, Geriatric Depression Scale, Multidimensional Health Locus of Control Scale, and the SCARED (stress, coping, argument, resources, events, and dependence) tool. The intervention was done in twenty 45- to 60-minute training sessions over 6 months. Data analysis were performed using <italic>&#x003c7;</italic><sup>2</sup> tests, multiple linear and logistic regression, and structural equation modeling (SEM).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support and health promoting lifestyle before the intervention was similar in the two groups. However, the frequency of high knowledge of elder abuse (94.8% in the intervention group and 46.6% in the control group), high self-efficacy (82.8% and 7.8%, respectively), high social support (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) and high health promoting lifestyle (97.0% and 10.3%, respectively) was significantly higher (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001) and the frequency of elder abuse risk (28.0% and 49.6%, respectively) was significantly less in the intervention group after the intervention. SEM standardized beta (S&#x003b2;) showed that the intervention had the highest impact on increase social support (S&#x003b2;=0.80, &#x003b2;=48.64, SE=1.70, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), self-efficacy (S&#x003b2;=0.76, &#x003b2;=13.32, SE=0.52, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05) and health promoting behaviors (S&#x003b2;=0.48, &#x003b2;=33.08, SE=2.26, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), respectively. The effect of the intervention on decrease of elder abuse risk was indirect and significant (S&#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.406, &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.340, SE=0.03, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), and through social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting behaviors.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>Educational interventions can be effective in preventing elder abuse.</p></sec></abstract><kwd-group><title>Keywords</title><kwd>elder abuse</kwd><kwd>self-efficacy</kwd><kwd>social support</kwd><kwd>health promotion</kwd><kwd>health education</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The world&#x02019;s population is rising, and the population of older adults is increasing rapidly as well, and their health and well-being require more attention.<xref rid="b1-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">1</xref> Due to physiological and anatomical changes caused by aging, the increase in physical and mental illnesses, social isolation due to retirement and disconnection with colleagues and friends, reduced social activity, low income, death of relatives and friends, and being away from children due to a number of factors, the older adults feel more lonely and depressed than other age groups.<xref rid="b2-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">2</xref> As a result, they are more vulnerable and subject to risks. One of these risks is elder abuse.<xref rid="b3-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">3</xref> Elder abuse, along with other indices such as life expectancy, is among the indicators of longevity and health.<xref rid="b4-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">4</xref> The World Health Organization describes elder abuse as any action or lack of appropriate action that causes injury or distress to an elderly person.<xref rid="b5-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="b6-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">6</xref> Elder abuse is an indirect cause of death, and its evaluation is difficult.<xref rid="b7-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">7</xref> Elder abuse has many systemic and individual effects. Any injury or distress to elders can result in worsening of their health and well-being. Even minor injuries can have serious and permanent effects on their health.<xref rid="b8-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">8</xref> Elder abuse has different forms.<xref rid="b9-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">9</xref> While most people think that elder abuse is physical, there are other types of elder abuse: psychological, financial, and sexual abuse. Other types of harassment, such as exploitation, abandonment, and neglect, have also been raised.<xref rid="b10-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></p><p>In some forms of elder abuse, the older adults have little or no insight into this problem or are unaware/unable to take care of themselves.<xref rid="b11-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">11</xref> Factors that affect elder abuse are sex, age, education level, marital status, housing status, lifestyle, social network and support, financial status, nutritional behavior, physical activity, sleep, leisure time, and recreation.<xref rid="b12-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Some of these factors can be controlled, and some are uncontrollable. Adopting health promoting behavior and implementing changes in lifestyle are feasible and have an impact on quality of life.<xref rid="b13-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></p><p>Population aging is now an important public health issue in Iran.<xref rid="b14-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">14</xref> In the near future, Iran will face a high proportion of elders in its population. It is estimated that the population over &#x0003e;60 years in Iran in 2021 will be &#x0003e;10%; by 2025, the proportion aged &#x0003e;65 years will be 10.4%; and by 2050, this will become &#x0003e;20%.<xref rid="b15-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">15</xref> This increase in the elder population can cause a health crisis that the nation should be prepared for. One crisis may be elder abuse. Elders should be empowered against abuse by education.<xref rid="b13-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">13</xref> Empowerment is a health promotion concept and one of the strategies for healthy aging. Research has shown that if the elderly can equip themselves with skills and abilities that empower them, then they can protect themselves from health threats, including elder abuse.<xref rid="b16-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">16</xref></p><p>There is a view that empowerment education should focus on social support, self-efficacy, and health locus of control.<xref rid="b12-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> Social support is one of the main health indicators of healthy aging and has a protective effect on disease. Self-efficacy is also an effective factor in healthy aging and can prevent elder abuse, along with other health promoting behavior and social support.<xref rid="b2-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="b17-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="b18-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">18</xref> Studies have confirmed the importance of self-efficacy as a determinant of health promoting behavior,<xref rid="b19-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b20-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">20</xref> while others have confirmed the relationship between social support and health promoting behavior<xref rid="b20-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b22-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">22</xref> and between self-efficacy and social support.<xref rid="b20-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="b23-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="b24-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">24</xref> The overall aim of this study was to design and evaluate the efficacy of an educational intervention for empowerment of the older adults, focusing on self-efficacy, social support, and health promoting behavior, in order to promote healthy aging and prevent elder abuse.</p><sec><title>Purpose</title><p>The educational intervention in this study was designed focusing on older adult empowerment, and then its impact on self-efficacy, social support, health promoting behavior, and risk reduction was investigated. In addition, we investigated relationships among demographic, socioeconomic, and lifestyle factors, perceived health status, feelings of loneliness, severity of depression, knowledge of elder abuse, health information sources, health barriers, health locus of control, and health promoting behavior, social support, self-efficacy, and level of elder abuse. The main hypothesis was to find out if the older adults that have social support and self-efficacy have more ability to adopt health promoting behavior and protect themselves from abuse.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Trial design</title><p>This study was a parallel randomized controlled educational trial study done on older adults.

The older adults themselves also helped design the training program and were actively involved in setting up the program and implementing it.</p><p>The content of the educational interventions was based on the dimensions of health promoting behavior and comprised physical activity, recreation and entertainment, sleep, nutrition, interpersonal relations and social support, responsibility for health, mental health, and older adult stress management. These interventions were designed to improve and identify ways to strengthen self-efficacy, raise knowledge about elder abuse, its outcomes, risk factors, and causes, ways to reduce and combat abuse, benefits of health promoting behavior, barriers to conducting health promoting behavior, methods for removing barriers, identifying sources of support, and ways to receive support. In preparing this educational content, factors such as being easy, comprehensive, applicable, creating motivation, and acceptability for the older adult were considered. For each session, a particular topic was considered. Educational technology methods, such as lecture, question and answer, and problem-solving, were used.</p><p>The contents of the training were provided as CD, booklet, and pamphlet to the participants. A few short films provided by the Iranian Health Policy Council, Ministry of Health and Medical Education tailored to the content of the educational intervention were displayed.

For each health house, at least 20 training sessions lasting 45&#x02013;60 minutes were arranged. The total educational program took 6 months. In total, 600 hours&#x02019; training was provided for each person. Training was provided by health care professionals, and classes were held in health houses.

The majority were married (57.3%) and had an educational degree less than a high school diploma (75.2%). Also, 57.3% (266 people) lived with their spouse and children. Regarding the question &#x0201c;How do you assess your health in the present?&#x0201d;, most reported that their health status was excellent (63.4%). The distribution of the demographic, social, economic, and clinical characteristics of the intervention and control groups was similar before the intervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t1-cia-13-669">Table 1</xref>).</p><p>The frequency of knowledge of elder abuse, self-efficacy, social support, health promoting behavior, and risk of elder abuse before the intervention was similar in the two groups. However, frequency of these variables in two groups was significantly different after intervention (<italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.001). Most of those in the intervention group received a more favorable score than the control group after intervention (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t2-cia-13-669">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The effect of educational intervention on self-efficacy, social support, and health promoting behavior (after intervention) and after control for variables before the intervention (sex, age, marital status, educational level, housing ownership, financial status, life structure, history of chronic illness, insurance, date of last referral to a physician, health status, information resources, health barriers, depression rate, loneliness, health locus of control, and amount of knowledge of elder abuse) was estimated using backward logistic and linear regression analyses.</p><p>The results of logistic and linear regression showed that there was a significant relationship between self-efficacy and health promoting behavior (after the intervention) with receiving the intervention, age, and education. Also, in the logistic model, social support (after the intervention) showed a significant relationship with intervention, sex, and health status (<xref ref-type="table" rid="t3-cia-13-669">Table 3</xref>). These significant variables entered SEM. As such, the primary model of self-efficacy, health promoting behavior and social support in preventing the risk of elder abuse was modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cia-13-669">Figure 2</xref>). For each path, the unstandardized coefficient was calculated. Positive and negative signs for each path indicated that for a 1-unit increase in each variable, the other variable&#x02019;s score increased or decreased. The GFI of the original SEM model was tested. GFI of 0.79 and incremental fit index of 0.78 indicated the fitness of the model. The standardized coefficients (S&#x003b2;) of the model showed that the effect of the intervention was primarily on social support (S&#x003b2;=0.80, &#x003b2;=48.64, SE=1.70) than on self-efficacy (S&#x003b2;=0.76, &#x003b2;=13.32, SE=0.52) and ultimately health promoting behavior (S&#x003b2;=0.48, &#x003b2;=33.08, SE=2.26) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="f2-cia-13-669">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>The adjusted SEM model for the prevention of elder abuse was fitted again after removing insignificant variables. The final SEM model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="f3-cia-13-669">Figure 3</xref>. The GFI of the final model was tested, and the indicators GFI of 0.9 and incremental fit index of 0.91 showed good fit. The results of the final model showed that receiving intervention, perceived health status, educational level, social support, and self-efficacy had an indirect effect on the risk of elder abuse. The intervention did not directly affect the risk of elder abuse, but this variable directly affected self-efficacy and social support, and these affected health promoting behavior. The effect of intervention on decrease of elder abuse risk was indirect and significant (S&#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.406, &#x003b2;=&#x02212;0.340, SE=0.03, <italic>P</italic>&#x0003c;0.05), and through social support, self-efficacy, and health-promoting behaviors. Finally, only health-promoting behaviors (HPB) had a direct impact on the risk of elder abuse.</p></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Various types of interventions have been designed and implemented with a variety of strategies, including educational, supportive, and legal strategies, for addressing the problem of elder abuse.<xref rid="b40-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">40</xref> In general, interventions in the area of primary or secondary prevention of elder abuse are divided into two broad categories. The first of these is interventions that are aimed at reducing the burden of abuse on the older adults and improving their health. These interventions are known as &#x0201c;elder-centered&#x0201d; strategies for empowering the elderly by using health promoting strategies, such as social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting behavior. The focus of this current study was on the design and implementation of these interventions. The second category of interventions is empowerment of the staff of health centers and organizations related to the health of the older adults in the area of primary prevention, in order to reduce the risk of elder abuse.<xref rid="b41-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></p><p>The focus of this current study was on the design and implementation of the first category interventions. In this study, knowledge in the field of elder abuse, self-efficacy, perceived social support, and health promoting behavior significantly improved in the intervention group. The results of this study are consistent with other studies that showed that educational interventions can be effective in improving elders&#x02019; abuse-related knowledge,<xref rid="b27-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="b28-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="b42-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>&#x02013;<xref rid="b45-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">45</xref> and intervention programs for prevention of elder abuse can lead to short-term improvements in the level of knowledge of the older adult in the field of elder abuse.</p><p>In this study, the self-efficacy score in the intervention group significantly increased, though self-efficacy scores in the two groups were mostly at an undesirable level before the intervention. Self-efficacy was used to increase health promoting behavior and to develop behavioral changes in the prevention of elder abuse in the target group. Self-efficacy directly promotes health promoting behavior through efficient expectations and indirectly affects planned behavioral change by influencing perceived barriers.<xref rid="b46-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">46</xref> Self-efficacy is an important factor in interventions aimed at changing unhealthy behavior and creating and maintaining healthy behavior. A person can make a behavioral change only if they believe that they are able to change.<xref rid="b19-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="b47-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">47</xref></p><p>Score for perceived social support for elder abuse risk reduction increased in the intervention group. These results are consistent with other studies that showed that educational interventions are effective in improving perceived social support for the older adult.<xref rid="b47-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="b48-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">48</xref> Social support is the strongest coping force to successfully cope with chronic diseases and stressful living conditions.<xref rid="b48-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="b49-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">49</xref> Social protection has two levels: understanding support and getting it. Among older people, understanding social support is more important than getting it. In many cases, there are social support resources, such as the family and the community, but the older adults do not receive favorable support for a variety of reasons, as they do not realize that they need help and should get help from someone. Several factors, such as cultural beliefs and elders&#x02019; beliefs, affect the understanding of their need for social support. Thinking about having independence and not imposing oneself on others are among the mental beliefs of the older adult and the most important obstacle to understanding their need for social support. If elderly people find themselves in situations requiring support and seek social support, then they will suffer less, because social support reduces their stress and improves their mental health.<xref rid="b50-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="b51-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">51</xref> Research has shown that older people with more social support have better mental health.<xref rid="b12-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>Health promoting behavior in terms of decreasing the risk of elder abuse was significantly higher in the group that received intervention. Health promoting behavior is among the major determinants of health and is directly associated with the prevention of disease.<xref rid="b12-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">12</xref> In order to cope with elder abuse, the elderly must have physical, psychological, and social well-being. In numerous studies, it has been proven that the adoption of health promoting behavior increases the quality of physical and mental health and reduces susceptibility to elder abuse.<xref rid="b12-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></p><p>The intervention caused a significant increase in self-efficacy, social support, and health promoting behavior. The SEM showed that the effects of educational interventions on perceived social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting behavior were not the same. Interventions had a greater impact on social protection than self-efficacy or health promoting behavior. This finding is very important, because it shows that in designing interventions to create behavioral changes, perceived social support and self-efficacy should be considered as important factors.</p><p>The final SEM model also showed that people with higher self-efficacy had a higher chance of understanding and gaining social support, and this resulted in more behavioral changes. The results of this study are consistent with other studies<xref rid="b13-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="b31-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">31</xref> that showed that those who had more efficacy and perceived and received social support were more likely to change behavior. Another finding from the present study was that interventions are effective in reducing the risk of elder abuse in the older adult, and the risk score among the older adult in the intervention group decreased after the intervention. The coefficients of SEM showed that the path coefficient of health promoting behavior to elder abuse risk was &#x02212;0.01; and for every 1-unit increase in health promoting behavior score, the average risk of elder abuse decreased by 0.01.</p><p>The SEM model showed that the effect of interventions on elder abuse was indirectly and significantly determined through social support, self-efficacy, and health promoting behavior. However, the impact of health promoting behavior on the risk of elder abuse was direct. In other words, older adults can protect themselves against the threats of elder abuse if they have health promoting behavior and the older adults who take care of their health and get through life better than others. This conclusion is consistent with the findings of other studies.<xref rid="b52-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>,<xref rid="b53-cia-13-669" ref-type="bibr">53</xref></p><p>The results of this study show a model for prevention of elder abuse. The GFI of the model was also tested statistically and showed its relevance. Most likely, this is the first research to use SEM to reduce the risk of elder abuse. The use of conceptual frameworks and planning to understand the factors associated with reducing the risk of elder abuse plays an important role in improving the quality of interventions. A limitation was that there was no follow-up to examine the long-term effects of the intervention on quality of life or health status of the target group. Other limitations of this study are lack of blinding, probable social desirability bias, volunteer bias, selection bias, and limited international and external validity of the findings.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusion</title><p>The increasing number of older adults and changes in culture, household structure, and lifestyle have increased the incidence of misconduct and elder abuse. Therefore, we need more understanding of the reasons for elder abuse and accurate planning for preventing it. In Iran, due to the cultural and religious context in which respect for older adults is emphasized, families are the most important and the original providers of emotional and psychological care for the older adult. For this reason, it is likely that in the absence of government attention and support, families are under pressure and experience trouble, which may increase the likelihood of elder abuse. The results of this study indicate a positive and significant effect of intervention based on empowerment of the elderly in improving health promoting behavior and reducing the risk of elder abuse. Therefore, organized and short-term training courses on elder abuse, risk factors, and methods for reducing it for all age groups can be effective in preventing this phenomenon. It is recommended that educational interventions for the prevention of elder abuse be started before reaching an advanced age. In addition, interventions focusing on the health system should be considered, in order to empower employees of health centers and organization in preventing elder abuse. Interventions focused on the health services system can sensitize health care providers, encourage them to do routine examinations, and design and implement management protocols for the older adult.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>This study was part of a PhD thesis at Tehran University of Medical Sciences.
