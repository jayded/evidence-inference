Thus, variations in the form and amount of inorganic particles in the polymeric matrix,[<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref><xref rid="ref7" ref-type="bibr">7</xref><xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>] in the photoinitiator system,[<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref><xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref><xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] handling, indications, among other factors, are increasingly frequent. However, the characteristics and effects of these composites are not yet fully elucidated, especially in the short term (early failure) and associated a clinical performance, making it difficult to choose the ideal restorative material.</p><p>The measure of success of a restorative treatment appears to be strongly associated to its longevity.[<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] Although laboratory tests can provide relevant information on the restoration longevity, the long-term performance of these systems still depends on clinical evaluations. However, clinical studies require a more effective approach and greater precision in the experimental design due to several variables which can influence the results such as: Difficulty of patient compliance, difficulty of evaluating the restorations longevity as an objective factor (operator, patient, and material), and difficulty to acquire a heterogenic group such as that present in clinical routine.[<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>] Hence, several studies[<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref><xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] have used selective groups (e.g., dental students). However, these groups are not truly representative because they have distinguished prevention and hygiene practices.</p><p>Therefore, all factors observed in several studies served as a base to the development of this study. The purpose of this randomized and double-blind study was to assess the clinical performance of two composites for posterior tooth, in Class I and II restorations, using public health service system, during baseline, after 6-, 12-, and 24-months. The null hypothesis tested was that there is no significant difference in clinical performance between Z250 and P60 resin systems when using in posterior teeth.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="sec1-2"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec id="sec2-1"><title>Patient selection and description of the groups</title><p>The study design was approved by the Human Ethics Committee Process #224. A total of seventy restorations were placed in molar and premolars in thirty patients (14 females and 16 males; 18&#x02013;40 years). The following parameters were set for sample size calculation: the expected proportion was 0.8, the relative standard error was of 10%, the power of the test was calculated to be 80% (beta error), and the two-tailed alpha error of 5% was 2-sided. Based on these data, a sample size of 25 subjects was found to be necessary. Taking into consideration a possible loss during the study, a 20% increase in sample size was set totalizing 30 subjects. All patients received dental treatment in a public health service system, allowing the formation of a heterogeneous sample, during 24-months. The following criteria were used to select subjects to the study: Good oral hygiene, low caries index, no periodontal disease neither parafunctional habits, the patients should have at least two posterior teeth (molars and/or premolars) with initial carious lesions to be treated, and/or teeth with unsatisfactory restorations which needed to be replaced. The relationship between Class I and Class II restorations was 1:2.[<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref><xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]</p><p>Patients committed to attend the annual recall by participating in the study, and they were divided into two study groups according to the tested materials [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. Each subject received at least two restorations with evaluated materials. The randomization process that has allocated the cavities and materials were performed by software SPSS-Statistical Package for Social Science, Software version 12, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA. Furthermore, aiming to secure a blind study, patients and examiners were unaware of any data from the randomization process.</p><table-wrap id="T1" position="float"><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Groups, composition and lot of materials used in the study</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="JCD-19-306-g001"/></table-wrap></sec><sec id="sec2-2"><title>Clinical procedures</title><p>Restorative procedures were carried out by an experienced clinician, who was submitted to a calibration process that consisted of performing 10 repeated restorations of each material under direct supervision of the project's coordinator. The operator's questions were addressed, and consensus was obtained during the calibration session. Teeth were carefully cleaned with pumice/water slurry, rinsed with water, and air-dried. All restorations were placed under rubber dam isolation. Bitewing radiographs were only taken when they were appropriate for diagnostic examination.</p><p>Amalgam and/or resin composite restorations considered unsatisfactory and cavity preparation were carried out with 245 carbide burs (Jet Burs, Beavers Dental Division of Sybron, Canada). All internal angles were rounded, and dislodged enamel prisms at gingival wall were removed with a gingival margin trimmer. Cavosurface angles were sharp with no bevel external surface. The criteria used in the evaluation of unsatisfactory restorations were restoration failure, dentin or base was exposed, contact point was missing (present periodontal inflammation), color and/or translucency beyond the normal range of tooth colors, marginal staining penetration in the direction of the pulp, marginal gap exhibiting the enamel&#x02013;dentin junction, fractured, loose filling that is missing partly or completely, and presence of caries (associated with the filling).[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]</p><p>Every detail of cavity preparation such as cavity depth, enamel presence at the cervical margin, sclerotic dentin, possible pulp exposition, fissures and defects in the enamel, and cavity extension were recorded. Therefore, four teeth were covered with calcium hydroxide (Dycal Dentsply Ind e. Com. Ltda., Petr&#x000f3;polis, RJ, Brazil) and resin-modified glass ionomer cement (Vitrebond; 3M Dental Products, St. Paul, MN, USA) since the thickness of the remaining dentin was less than approximately 0.5 mm.</p><p>Enamel was etched for 30 s and dentin for 15 s with 37% phosphoric acid gel (Scotchbond Etchant; 3M Dental Products, St. Paul, MN, USA), washed for 30 s, and gently dried with air jet. The adhesive system (Single Bond, 3M Dental Products, St. Paul, MN, USA) and the resins composite were applied to the dental substrates in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. To provide the largest free surface area, the resins composite were inserted in 2 mm thick increments. Each increment was light-cured for 40 s using a halogen curing light (Curing Light XL 3000, 3M Dental Products, St. Paul, MN, USA), with minimum light intensity of 600 mW/cm<sup>2</sup> and checked by a light-curing meter (Hilux Dental Curing Light Meter, Benlioglu Dental Inc., Turkey). Class II cavities, the proximal wall, was reconstructed to transform into a Class I cavity, with the aid of polyester strip matrix (K-Dent Quimidrol, Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil) and dental interproximal wedges (TDV Dental Ltda, Pomerode, Santa Catarina, Brazil). Resin insertion in the occlusal box was performed in cone-shaped increments according to progressive waxing technique.</p><p>The restorations were immediately finished by removing excess material, whereas the finishing and polishing were performed after 1 week, using a 12-fluted tungsten carbide burs (Jet Burs, Beavers Dental Division of Sybron, Canada), the Enhance Polishing System (Dentsply, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) and Sof-Lex Polishing discs (3M Dental Products, St. Paul, MN, USA).</p></sec><sec id="sec2-3"><title>Clinical evaluation</title><p>The restorations were evaluated by two calibrated examiners, and they were unaware of which material had been used. The examiners were calibrated before the baseline evaluation using picture slides representing each condition to be assessed in the study, and any disagreements during evaluation were resolved by consensus among the examiners. Modified US Public Health Service (USPHS) criteria [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T2">Table 2</xref>] were used to evaluate marginal discoloration, marginal integrity, surface texture, wear, postoperative sensitivity, and recurrent caries[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref><xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] at baseline, after 6-, 12-, and 24-months.

Clinical evaluation of restorative procedures requires (a) choices of clinically relevant criteria, (b) assessment using simple nominal scales, (c) calibration of evaluators, (d) two independent evaluations, and (e) nonparametric statistical analysis that recognizes the patient (and not the restoration) as the independent variable.[<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>] Furthermore, USPHS evaluates only the degree of deviation from ideal restoration.[<xref rid="ref20" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] However, there is still no complete and accurate method that can evaluate all these numerous variables.</p><p>Problems in tooth restoration interface such as marginal integrity, marginal stain, and secondary caries are associated to materials physics and mechanics properties - elasticity modulus, thermal expansion coefficient, and curing shrinkage - and overall to enamel marginal finishing. A low elasticity modulus determines a greater material deformation when force is applied, damaging adhesive bonding due to fatigue in tooth restoration interface. Tooth and restorative materials show different thermal expansion coefficient; therefore, temperature change that takes place in oral cavity leads to stress in adhesive interface breaking hybridization bonding. That situation plus curing shrinkage ends up with leakage and marginal discoloration.[<xref rid="ref3" ref-type="bibr">3</xref><xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]</p><p>Marginal integrity criteria showed distinct values; nevertheless, there was no significant statistically difference. Both materials showed a slight degradation along the time, noticed through the changing in restoration scores from alpha to Bravo along the 6 and 24 months. In the first 6 months, Group I (Single Bond and Filtek Z250) showed 100% alpha score, after 12 months 97.1% and 2.9% Bravo, and after 24 months showed 88.6% alpha score and 11.4% Bravo score. Group II (Single Bond and Filtek P60) showed after 6 months 6% Bravo score, and after 12 and 24 months 91.4% to alpha score and 8.6% to Bravo score. This could probably be due to small fracture of the cavosurface margin and material. According to marginal discoloration, both materials showed similar score, showing after 12 months 100% Alpha score and after 24 months 97.1% alpha score. Concerning secondary caries both materials showed identical clinical behavior after 24 months which was 100% alpha score. Those results matched the findings from T&#x000fc;rk&#x000fc;n and Oguz,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Leinfelder,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] Cenci <italic>et al</italic>., and[<xref rid="ref23" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] Gianordoli Neto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]</p><p>Analyzing the results for postoperative sensitivity, it was noticed that both materials (Group I and Group II) showed 100% alpha score in all evaluated periods. All cavity margins had enamel present which increases significantly the restorative adhesive system sealing capacity, decreasing possibility of marginal microleakage, and its consequences such as postoperative sensitivity.</p><p>It was observed in present research that there was no statistical difference between materials. Nevertheless, there was a numerical difference (percentage) to marginal integrity in Group I, which is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>. The resins composite are both indicated for posterior restorations but differ in terms of handling characteristics. However, the lack of difference occurred due to similarities in the chemical composition of the composites used [<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>]. P60 is filled to 61% by volume with zirconia/silica filler particles having a size range of from 0.01 to 3.5 &#x000b5;m, contain a greater number of smaller particles and the total load is approximately to 84% for weight. Z250 is filled to 60% by volume with zirconia/silica particles having a size range of 0.01&#x02013;3.5 &#x000b5;m and an average size of 0.6 &#x000b5;m, contains also a greater number of smaller particles and the total load is approximately to 78% for weight. Probably, the difference may occur in longer observation periods.</p><p>Since materials were distributed likewise in the same patient, the variable patient factor cannot be used as a cause of greater wear. It was observed no wear after 12 months, only notice after 24 months, which matched the results from T&#x000fc;rk&#x000fc;n and Oguz,[<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] Gianordoli Neto <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref rid="ref24" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] That happened because the improving of composites physic properties. New formulations decreasing tremendously the average size of particles have been developed over the last decade. Besides that, the incremental technique favored better clinical results, once lower increments decreased inner porosity and improved composite conversion rate, which reduced the observed wear.</p><p>All restorations in this research had final polishing and finishing after 7 days. The polishing consists of making the restoration surface look as enamel. After evaluation of superficial texture in different periods (baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months), Filtek Z250 (Group I) restorations showed 100% after 12 months and 94.3% alpha score after 24 months and Filtek P60 (Group II) showed after the same period 97.1% and 94.3%.</p><p>Both restorative adhesive systems used are hybrid and have as inorganic phase extremely small silica and zircon particles. It is associated to resin matrix with components (triethylene glycol dimethacrylate) increasing the molecular bonding and a higher conversion rate of double linking during curing process, which leads to a great resistant organic matrix. According to Anusavise[<xref rid="ref21" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>] and Leinfelder,[<xref rid="ref22" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] decreasing size, changing composition, and increasing quantity of particles made nowadays composites 10&#x02013;15 times superior than the previous ones in wear resistance and surface texture maintenance. In accordance with the results of the present study, few clinical alterations were observed in the resin composite wear and surface texture. This leads us to accept the null hypothesis.</p><p>All restorations after 24 months appeared to be clinically acceptable but are important to follow-up these restorations for a longer period to analyze the clinical performance of the resin composite systems. Long-term clinical trials are certainly needed because they remain the ultimate way to collect scientific evidence on the clinical effectiveness of restorative treatments.</p></sec><sec sec-type="conclusions" id="sec1-5"><title>CONCLUSIONS</title><p>On the basis of the results and despite the limitations of this study, it seems reasonable to conclude that all direct resin composite
