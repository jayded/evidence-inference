However, because each study examined a small set of cues, often in a unique paradigm, the relative efficacy of different sensory contextual cues is unclear. In the present study we quantify how seven contextual cues, some investigated previously and some novel, affect the formation and recall of motor memories. Subjects made movements in a velocity-dependent curl field, with direction varying randomly from trial to trial but always associated with a unique contextual cue. Linking field direction to the cursor or background color, or to peripheral visual motion cues, did not reduce interference. In contrast, the orientation of a visual object attached to the hand cursor significantly reduced interference, albeit by a small amount. When the fields were associated with movement in different locations in the workspace, a substantial reduction in interference was observed. We tested whether this reduction in interference was due to the different locations of the visual feedback (targets and cursor) or the movements (proprioceptive). When the fields were associated only with changes in visual display location (movements always made centrally) or only with changes in the movement location (visual feedback always displayed centrally), a substantial reduction in interference was observed. These results show that although some visual cues can lead to the formation and recall of distinct representations in motor memory, changes in spatial visual and proprioceptive states of the movement are far more effective than changes in simple visual contextual cues.</p></abstract><kwd-group><kwd>motor learning</kwd><kwd>visual cues</kwd><kwd>interference</kwd><kwd>dynamic adaptation</kwd><kwd>state-dependent learning</kwd></kwd-group></article-meta></front><body><p><sc>during interactions with objects</sc> in the environment, our sensorimotor control system uses sensory information to adapt to novel dynamics (<xref rid="B27" ref-type="bibr">Lackner and Dizio 1994</xref>; <xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994</xref>). Two conceptually different forms of sensory information can be used. First, error-related sensory information about the dynamics, such as proprioceptive and visual errors, can be used to update the controller (<xref rid="B8" ref-type="bibr">Franklin et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B24" ref-type="bibr">Kawato et al. 1987</xref>; <xref rid="B37" ref-type="bibr">Shadmehr et al. 2010</xref>; <xref rid="B40" ref-type="bibr">Thoroughman and Shadmehr 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B41" ref-type="bibr">van Beers 2009</xref>). Second, there are contextual sensory cues, which are not directly related to errors but can be informative about the dynamics. For example, the visual appearance of an object, such as whether it looks like it is made of metal or plastic, or the geometrical structure of an object can be used to adjust control in an anticipatory manner (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Flanagan et al. 2008</xref>; <xref rid="B13" ref-type="bibr">Gordon et al. 1993</xref>; <xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ingram et al. 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that in the absence of contextual information, two opposing dynamical force fields presented sequentially produce substantial interference during learning (<xref rid="B3" ref-type="bibr">Brashers-Krug et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B5" ref-type="bibr">Caithness et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gandolfo et al. 1996</xref>; <xref rid="B23" ref-type="bibr">Karniel and Mussa-Ivaldi 2002</xref>; <xref rid="B25" ref-type="bibr">Krakauer et al. 1999</xref>). However, several studies have shown that when different sensory contextual cues are each associated with one of the fields, interference can be reduced (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Addou et al. 2011</xref>; <xref rid="B6" ref-type="bibr">Cothros et al. 2009</xref>; <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima and Nozaki 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B18" ref-type="bibr">Hwang and Shadmehr 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al. 2006</xref>; <xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Krouchev and Kalaska 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Osu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B34" ref-type="bibr">Richter et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wada et al. 2003</xref>). This shows that contextual information can allow the formation and recall of separate motor memories for the opposing dynamics.</p><p>Although a range of contextual cues has been examined, because prior studies only used a small set of cues, often in a unique paradigm, it is hard to assess the conflicting results or determine the relative efficacy of different sensory contextual cues. Such differences in experimental design include the number of targets, the form and strength of the dynamic force fields, the ordering of trials, the use of arm movements vs. elbow movements, and the length of the movements. In particular, some studies have examined only a single movement direction (e.g., <xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima and Nozaki 2012</xref>; <xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al. 2006</xref>), which raises a possible problem, since cognitive strategies may be easier to use for a single movement direction. There are also conflicting reports of the behavior of some cues in the literature. In particular, the effectiveness of color as a contextual cue for learning opposing dynamics is controversial. One of the first studies showed no reduction in interference when the room color lighting was linked to each field (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gandolfo et al. 1996</xref>). However, more recent studies have demonstrated a reduction in interference with extensive training both in monkeys (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Krouchev and Kalaska 2003</xref>) and in humans (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Addou et al. 2011</xref>) or where there is random and frequent switching between the two fields (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Osu et al. 2004</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wada et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>There is extensive evidence suggesting that motor memories can be learned as a function of limb state. For example, two opposing force fields can be learned if each is linked with a different grasp of the robot handle (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gandolfo et al. 1996</xref>) or with different locations in the workspace (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al. 2006</xref>). A strong effect of the location of visual feedback of the hand and targets also has been recently demonstrated (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima and Nozaki 2012</xref>). In the study, participants made movements to two possible targets, one to the left and the other to the right of straight ahead. However, by associating a counterclockwise and a clockwise visuomotor rotation of the hand cursor with trials to the left and right targets, it was possible to get the subjects to make the same physical movement (i.e., straight ahead) to achieve different visual movements to the two targets. When each target was associated with a different field, participants could learn the opposing dynamics on the basis of the differences in visual feedback despite the movements being in the same physical space.</p><p>In the present study we use an interference paradigm to investigate the relative effectiveness of different contextual cues and changes in state, some of which have been investigated previously and some of which are novel. We distinguish state changes from contextual cues, with the latter referring to sensory information unrelated to the state of the arm. Therefore, cues can include features such as the background color or visual orientation of a handheld object. In contrast, state changes can include different configurations of the arm, whether real or perceived. However, it is possible for state changes to be investigated within the same framework as that used for sensory contextual cue, thereby unifying these conditions within the same experimental paradigm. Therefore, for convenience, we refer to the different experimental conditions, be they sensory cues or states, as contextual cues. Our unified interference paradigm ensures that each interference experiment differs only in terms of the contextual cue, with all other experimental features remaining consistent across experiments. This allows us to assess and rank their ability in the formation and recall of distinct motor memories. Subjects performed center-out reaching movements to eight targets in which one of two opposing curl force fields was applied. The direction of the curl field was consistent with a contextual cue, which was presented both before and during the movement. This paradigm was used to contrast the effectiveness of seven contextual cues: cursor color, background color, peripheral visual motion, object orientation, pure visual offset, pure movement offset, and workspace offset. Whereas some of these conditions have been studied previously, albeit many using only a single direction of movement, the peripheral visual motion and object orientation are novel conditions.</p><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><p>A total of 48 (22 male, 26 female) right-handed subjects, mean age 22.7 (SD 5.2) yr old, took part in 8 experiments (6 subjects in each experiment). Subjects provided written informed consent and were naive to the aims of the experiments. A local ethics committee approved the protocol, and all subjects were right-handed as based on the Edinburgh handedness questionnaire (<xref rid="B31" ref-type="bibr">Oldfield 1971</xref>).</p><sec><title/><sec><title>Apparatus.</title><p>All experiments were performed with the use of a vBOT planar robotic manipulandum, with associated virtual reality system and air table (<xref rid="B16" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al. 2009</xref>). The vBOT is a custom-built back-drivable planar robotic manipulandum, which exhibits low mass at its handle. Position is measured with optical encoders sampled at 1,000 Hz, and torque motors allow endpoint forces to be specified. The position signal was used unfiltered, whereas velocity was computed by fitting a quadratic motion equation, assuming constant acceleration, over a window that consisted of the 30 most recent position samples and associated time stamps. The vBOT was fitted with a force transducer (Nano 25; ATI) mounted at the handle to measure the applied forces. Before digitization, the output channels of the force transducers were low-pass filtered at 500 Hz using analog 4th-pole Bessel filters. Subjects were seated in a sturdy chair in front of the apparatus and firmly strapped against the backrest with a four-point seatbelt to reduce body movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F1">Fig. 1<italic>A</italic></xref>). Subjects grasped the robot handle in their right hand while an air sled (constraining movement to the horizontal plane) supported their right forearm. Visual feedback was provided using a computer monitor mounted above the vBOT and was projected veridically to the subject via a mirror. This mirror prevented subjects from viewing their hand directly and allowed the visual feedback of the target (1.25-cm-radius disk), the starting location (1.0-cm-radius disk), and hand cursor (0.5-cm-radius red disk) to be presented in the plane of movement. In all experiments, except for the background color cue experiment, a black background was employed.</p><fig id="F1" position="float"><label>Fig. 1.</label><caption><p>Experimental paradigm. <italic>A</italic>: the subject grasps the handle of the robotic manipulandum (vBOT) while seated.

During this movement, the vBOT was either passive (null field) or produced a clockwise (CW) or a counterclockwise (CCW) velocity-dependent curl field.

The sign of <italic>k</italic> determined the direction of the force field (CW or CCW), and this varied pseudorandomly from trial to trial.</p><p>One type of contextual cue was used in each experiment, and the direction of the field was predictable based on the contextual cue. The experiments were counterbalanced such that in each experiment, half of the subjects experienced the contextual cues matched to one set of force field directions, whereas the other half of the subjects experienced the contextual cues matched to the opposite force field directions. This was performed to avoid any bias arising from associations between a particular context and field direction. The ability of seven different contextual cues to reduce the interference between the two fields (CW and CCW) was examined.</p><p>Within each experiment, blocks of 18 trials were performed consisting of 16 field trials and 2 clamp trials. In the field trials, each of the eight targets was presented with both of the two possible field directions. The order of the movements within each block was pseudorandom, except that a clamp trial always occurred in the first and last four trials of each block. The two clamp trials always occurred for movements to the 0&#x000b0; target (straight ahead), one trial with a contextual cue for a CW field and one trial with a contextual cue for a CCW field (randomizing which came first within each block). In a clamp trial, the movement was confined to a simulated mechanical channel with a spring constant of 10,000 N/m (<xref rid="B29" ref-type="bibr">Milner and Franklin 2005</xref>; <xref rid="B35" ref-type="bibr">Scheidt et al. 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B38" ref-type="bibr">Smith et al. 2006</xref>).</p><p>Each experiment began with a preexposure phase consisting of 12 blocks in which no forces were applied (216 null trials), followed by an exposure phase of 75 blocks (1,350 field trials), and finally a postexposure phase consisting of 4 blocks (72 null trials). Subjects were given a short rest on average every 200 trials (195&#x02013;205 trials).</p><p>On each trial, the central start location was displayed and the robotic manipulandum passively moved the subject's hand to the center location (following a minimum jerk trajectory). A trial was initiated by the hand cursor remaining within the home location at a speed below 0.1 cm/s for 300 ms. Both the target and the contextual cue were then presented, with the latter depending on (and therefore predictive of) the direction of the upcoming curl field (in the exposure condition). After a delay of 1,000 ms, an acoustic tone sounded to indicate that the subject should initiate the movement to the target (within 500 ms). Subjects were required to wait in the starting location for 1,000 ms preceding the acoustic signal to ensure that they had time to observe the contextual cue and also to ensure that prior passive movement to the starting location could have no contextual effect (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012</xref>). If the duration of the movement (measured from the time the cursor had moved 2 cm from the center location until it entered the target) was between 150 and 250 ms, a &#x0201c;GREAT&#x0201d; message was displayed; otherwise a &#x0201c;TOO FAST&#x0201d; or a &#x0201c;TOO SLOW&#x0201d; warning was given accordingly.</p></sec><sec><title>Experiment 1: cursor color.</title><p><italic>Experiment 1</italic> (<italic>n</italic> = 6) examined the contextual effects of a colored cursor.

Movement error was calculated on each trial by analyzing the hand movement from the central to the target location. The maximum perpendicular error (MPE) of the hand path from a straight path from the center location to the target was calculated. For each subject, the MPE was sign adjusted appropriately so that errors from CW and CCW curl field trials could be combined, and then the average of the MPE for all exposure trials within a block was computed.

The force produced by subjects into the wall of the simulated channel was integrated across the movement. To evaluate the degree of compensation, the measured force was divided by the amount of force that would be required for perfect compensation in the force field (calculated as the field constant multiplied by the actual velocity integrated across the movement on each trial). The values of percent force compensation throughout the experiment are based on the compensation required in the curl force field. Therefore, values in the null force field before learning (preexposure phase) should be close to zero.</p><p>We performed hypothesis-based planned comparisons and report uncorrected <italic>P</italic> values to determine statistical significance.

However, these studies examined a single or a small set of cues, each often using a unique paradigm, with different task parameters and movement numbers, making quantitative comparisons between the results difficult. In the present study we used an interference task to undertake a systematic investigation of the contextual effects of seven cues along with a pure control condition. This enabled us to quantify them in terms their ability to form distinct motor memories to opposing dynamics. A specific contextual cue was associated with each of two opposing force fields. The amount of learning was examined by using the reduction in kinematic error and increase in force compensation during the exposure trials, as well as the size of aftereffects (in both kinematic error and force) during the postexposure trials. We found dramatic differences in the efficacy of these sensory contextual cues. Our results show that although some visual cues, such as color, have little or no effect, other cues, such as changes in spatial visual and proprioceptive states of the movement, are far more effective and can lead to the formation and recall of distinct representations in motor memory.</p><p>The results demonstrated that changes in color (of either the cursor or background), while able to slightly but significantly reduce kinematic error during the field exposure, did not result in changes in endpoint force or aftereffects. Importantly, a control experiment, in which an identical red cursor indicated both curl field directions (therefore providing no visual contextual information), provided identical results. That is, a slight reduction in MPE was observed during field exposure, with no accompanying changes in endpoint force or aftereffects. Although reduction in kinematic error is often assumed to indicate adaptation to dynamics, our results indicate that subjects did not form a force field-specific motor memory of the two dynamics, since the latter would have produced force compensation and aftereffects. Instead, the results suggest that subjects used a general strategy (contextually nonspecific) of increasing limb stiffness (<xref rid="B4" ref-type="bibr">Burdet et al. 2001</xref>; <xref rid="B9" ref-type="bibr">Franklin et al. 2007</xref>; <xref rid="B39" ref-type="bibr">Takahashi et al. 2001</xref>) through increases in cocontraction (<xref rid="B10" ref-type="bibr">Franklin et al. 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B28" ref-type="bibr">Milner and Cloutier 1998</xref>; <xref rid="B32" ref-type="bibr">Osu et al. 2002</xref>) or feedback gains (<xref rid="B11" ref-type="bibr">Franklin et al. 2012</xref>). Such changes will reduce the perturbing effects of the force field but produce no net force on the channel wall or aftereffects when the force fields are removed. Therefore, on the timescale of our experiment, cursor color had essentially no effect on reducing interference. These results are consistent with previous studies that have indicated no learning (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gandolfo et al. 1996</xref>) and with others that have shown substantial training is required for a color to have an effective contextual effect (<xref rid="B26" ref-type="bibr">Krouchev and Kalaska 2003</xref>; <xref rid="B42" ref-type="bibr">Wada et al. 2003</xref>).</p><p>Despite its strong salient appearance, we found no evidence for frame color acting as contextual cue, and we were unable to reproduce the learning effects that have been previously reported (<xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Osu et al. 2004</xref>). Although significant decreases in error occurred in both our study and that of <xref rid="B33" ref-type="bibr">Osu et al. (2004)</xref>, here we have shown that decreases in endpoint error are not always associated with contextually appropriate adaptation of endpoint forces. We note that a previous study has shown a strong and rapid contextual effect of color during dynamic learning in human participants (<xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Addou et al. 2011</xref>). There are several differences in the task and perturbation used in this previous study that could explain the observed learning. First, their task involved control of a single degree of freedom; that is, elbow flexion and extension. Second, only two targets were used, a flexion and an extension target from a central start location. Third, the applied perturbations were purely resistive and assistive viscous forces. In contrast, in our experiments we applied two-dimensional force fields during unconstrained planar (2 joint) movements to eight targets. We hypothesize that the ability to learn to switch on the basis of color described by <xref rid="B1" ref-type="bibr">Addou et al. (2011)</xref> arises because of the simplicity of the field and task. In particular, when the number of movements is small and the perturbation simple, it is possible to employ more cognitive strategies to achieve color-dependent switching. Our experiments were designed to hinder the use of cognitive strategies by employing complex fields and eight target directions. Our results clearly indicate that for such complex fields and multiple movement directions, color is, at best, a weak contextual cue, compared with other sensory contextual cues.</p><p>Although many studies have shown that static visual cues, such as cursor color (<xref rid="B12" ref-type="bibr">Gandolfo et al. 1996</xref>) or cue location (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012</xref>), produce little or no contextual learning, recent work has shown that prior visual motion can act as a strong contextual cue (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012</xref>). However, in this previous study, the visual motion was motion of the subject's cursor directly prior to movement in the force field. The direction of the cursor movement was predictive of the directionality of the force field experienced in the subsequent movement. From the current work it can be seen that an arbitrary visual motion cue does not produce such contextual effects even when it is uniquely associated with the force field direction. Here we investigated whether peripheral background movement within the workspace could act as a contextual cue by employing movement of disks around the periphery of the workspace. Such motion did not lead to context-dependent learning. Together, these results suggest that visual movement needs to be more closely associated with the task, or even be considered part of it by the motor system, for it to have a strong contextual effect. It remains to be determined exactly how closely associated the visual motion needs to be to the task, but it is clear that any arbitrary motion cannot be used to learn independent motor memories.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that subjects can use visual information to identify the location of the center of mass of objects (<xref rid="B2" ref-type="bibr">Bingham and Muchisky 1993</xref>). Subjects can also scale grip force to lift objects on the basis of visual appearance of objects (<xref rid="B21" ref-type="bibr">Jenmalm and Johansson 1997</xref>; <xref rid="B30" ref-type="bibr">Mon-Williams and Murray 2000</xref>; <xref rid="B43" ref-type="bibr">Wing and Lederman 1998</xref>). More recently, it has been shown that the visual appearance of a hammer at different orientations can be used to immediately recall the structural form of its complex grasp-dependent dynamics (<xref rid="B20" ref-type="bibr">Ingram et al. 2010</xref>). Therefore, there are a large number of studies demonstrating that the sensorimotor control system uses visual information of objects to determine the appropriate motor memory to use for control. Such studies motivated us to examine whether the addition of a visual object connected to the cursor could be associated with different dynamics. In particular we chose two arbitrary objects, matched in size, with no direct relation with the associated forces with either force field (considering all 8 directions of motion). Using this arbitrary association, we demonstrated that linking the field direction to the orientation of a visual object attached to the cursor significantly reduced interference, albeit by a small amount. Thus the orientation of an asymmetric cursor has a small but significant contextual effect, suggesting that the visual representation of an object can have a direct effect on the formation and recall of motor memories. However, we note that the asymmetric cursor condition exhibits some similarity to the visual offset condition, although its effects are much weaker. In both of these experiments the location of visual feedback was context dependent and offset to either the left or the right of the central home position. Thus, in the object orientation experiment, there may also exhibit some contextual effect due to differences in visual state of the cursor.</p><p>It has been suggested that the learning of dynamics occurs by representing the command necessary to compensate for the dynamics as a function of the state of the arm (<xref rid="B36" ref-type="bibr">Shadmehr and Mussa-Ivaldi 1994</xref>). This would suggest that learning at one location in the workspace might not interfere with learning at another location in the workspace if the movements were sufficiently different in the state space. Indeed, it has been shown that two opposing force fields can be learned independently when they are performed in single movements separated by more than 7 cm (<xref rid="B17" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al. 2003</xref>). In our study, when subjects adapted to the two oppositely rotated curl force fields in two distinct workspace locations, little interference was observed and the predictive force compensation to the field directions as determined on the clamp trials approached 80%. This is at a level only slightly below what has been seen for single force field adaptation for either two (<xref rid="B22" ref-type="bibr">Joiner and Smith 2008</xref>) or four training directions (<xref rid="B15" ref-type="bibr">Howard et al. 2012</xref>). Therefore, these results support the findings of previous work that demonstrated little or no interference for force fields learned in different workspace locations provided there is sufficient distance between the workspace locations.</p><p>Learning two force fields in two different locations can be decomposed into two components. The first is that the visual feedback occurs in a different workspace, and the second is that the physical location (and proprioceptive feedback) of the movement occurs in different locations. When the individual effect of these two components were examined for single movement directions, it was found that learning was higher for differences in proprioception than for differences in vision, both of which were less than for the different workspace condition (<xref rid="B19" ref-type="bibr">Hwang et al. 2006</xref>). However, even for learning in the single direction of movement, the overall levels of adaptation were small. In our study we found significant reduction in interference for the shift in both visual and proprioceptive task location. Interestingly, in this case we found no difference in the degree of learning between the shift in proprioceptive task space and the shift in the workspace location. In contrast, when only the visual task location was different for the two fields, there was significantly more interference between the two tasks. The combined visual and proprioceptive shift is a state change, and the purely visual or purely proprioceptive shifts could be interpreted as either a cue or state change. We hypothesize that these are more likely to relate to changes in perceived state. Of course, we acknowledge that there are other differences that arise when the visual locations are separated, such as the direction of the subject's gaze, which could also act as a contextual cue.</p><p>The contextual effect of visual target shift in the absence of physical shift has also recently been studied through the introduction of visuomotor rotations (<xref rid="B14" ref-type="bibr">Hirashima and Nozaki 2012</xref>). Subjects made movements to two targets that were initially located 30&#x000b0; off the midsagittal line to the left and right, respectively. A corresponding 30&#x000b0; visuomotor rotation was gradually introduced to the two targets such that, after adaptation, subjects made identical physical movements along the midsagittal line for both targets. At this point, opposing curl fields associated with the two targets were introduced, to which subjects were able to adapt. Our results are consistent with these finding; both studies demonstrate significant learning but the presence of some interference limiting full compensation for the two force fields. However, our experimental results show that learning of opposing dynamics on the basis of contextual cues in the form of visual offsets can be achieved in multiple movement directions and without the need for a gradual introduction of the visual offset.</p><p>Overall, our findings indicate that more abstract aspects of vision, such as color, have a weaker, if any, effect on dynamic learning in the motor system than other visual aspects of the environment (such as object orientation), which may correlate more strongly with required changes in motor behavior. However, the strongest effects in this study were found for conditions in which the state space was sufficiently different between the two fields (through either visual or proprioceptive differences in state). We suggest that this difference may arise not simply because the different workspace cues are more salient, but because the motor memories are learned as a function of the state of the limbs. Because both visual and proprioceptive information can be used by the sensorimotor control system to estimate the limb state, distinct sensory cues from visual and proprioceptive modalities will influence the state space in which the novel dynamics are learned. We propose therefore that these differences illustrate a conceptual difference between two types of cue. First, subjects can learn to associate arbitrary sensory cues (e.g., object orientation in <italic>experiment 5</italic>) with different dynamics, but this effect takes substantial time and appears a weak cue. Second, sensory cues that dissociate the visual or proprioceptive state of the arm may automatically alter the neural coding of the movement so as to allow separate motor memories to be learned rapidly. We hypothesize that this distinction arises because dynamics can be represented in terms of the state of the limb, and modification of the proprioceptive or visual feedback of the limb will alter the estimated state. In contrast, other cues require associative learning to map the sensory cue with the appropriate internal model of the dynamics for both recall (before movement) and error assignment (during and after the motion) to produce an effect. This is because they have little a priori influence to the motor system. Indeed, the size weight illusion demonstrates this: it can be reversed, but only with substantial training (<xref rid="B7" ref-type="bibr">Flanagan et al. 2008</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, we have shown that sensory contextual information can play a fundamental role in reducing interference and lead to the formation of separate motor memories for distinct dynamics. Our study has enabled us to rank the effectiveness of seven such contextual cues by using a standardized protocol across all experimental conditions. The results demonstrate that different aspects of sensory information provide better contextual cues than others, with conditions that could influence the estimated limb state having the strongest effects. Overall, this work demonstrates the importance of state-dependent sensory information in the formation and recall of independent motor memories.</p></sec><sec><title>GRANTS</title><p>We thank the Wellcome Trust and the Human Frontiers Science Program for support.</p></sec><sec><title>DISCLOSURES</title><p>The authors declare that they have no financial, personal, or professional interests that could be construed to have influenced the paper.</p></sec><sec><title>AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS</title><p>I.S.H., D.M.W., and D.W.F. conception and design of research; I.S.H. performed experiments; I.S.H. and D.W.F. analyzed data; I.S.H., D.M.W., and D.W.F. interpreted results of experiments; I.S.H. and D.W.F. prepared figures; I.S.H. drafted manuscript; I.S.H., D.M.W., and D.W.F. edited and revised manuscript; I.S.H., D.M.W., and D.W.F. approved final version of manuscript.</p></sec></body><back><ack><title>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</title><p>We thank Sae Franklin for assistance with the experiments.</p></ack><ref-list><title>REFERENCES</title><ref id="B1"><mixed-citation publication-type="journal">
