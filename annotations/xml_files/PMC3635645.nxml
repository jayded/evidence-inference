Therefore, we conducted a prospective study to determine the effect-site concentrations of remifentanil to prevent cardiovascular instability, which can develop during induction with high desflurane concentrations.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods"><title>MATERIALS AND METHODS</title><sec><title>Subjects</title><p>After approval by the Institutional Review Board and Ethics Committee (SNUMC/SNUHIRB of Seoul National University Hospital, Seoul, Korea, H-0904-016-276, chairman Prof BJ Park, 23 May 2009) and receiving individual written informed consent, 69 patients with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I between the age 20-65 years undergoing general anesthesia during the period of May 2009 to July 2009 were enrolled in this study. Patients were excluded if they met any of the following criteria: 1) habitual drug abuse of a sedative or hypnotic; 2) anemia (hematocrit less than 24%) or patients who require premedication; 3) high gastric content aspiration risk; 4) difficult airway; 5) patients with HR greater than 100 or less than 45 beats per minute before induction; 6) patients with the systolic blood pressure (SBP) greater than 160 mm Hg or less than 90 mm Hg before induction. Patients were randomly allocated into three groups by a computer-generated randomization schedule according to target effect-site concentrations of remifentanil (R2=2 ng/mL, R4=4 ng/mL, R6=6 ng/mL). Two patients in group R4 and three patients in group R6 did not receive allocated intervention because their SBP were greater than 160 mm Hg.</p></sec><sec><title>General anesthesia</title><p>Patients were randomly assigned to three groups and assignment was concealed in an envelope until the patient's entrance into the operating room. And independent observer took an envelope and prepared the target controlled infusion pump (Orchestra&#x000ae;, Fresinius Vial, France) for the infusion of remifentanil.</p><p>Premedication was not provided and patients were monitored with continuous electrocardiography, pulse oximetry and automated noninvasive blood pressure measurements. Patients were allowed to rest prior to baseline BP and HR measurements.</p><p>After the injection of lidocaine 30 mg and etomidate 0.2 mg/kg, remifentanil was infused in target effect-site concentrations of 2 ng/mL (Group R2, n=23), 4 ng/mL (Group R4, n=21) and 6 ng/mL (Group R6, n=20). The Minto model was used for remifentanil pharmacokinetic parameters. After confirmation of a loss of consciousness, rocuronium 0.6 mg/kg was injected. A semiclosed circle system was used with ventilation controlled by mask to maintain normocarbia as measured with end-tidal carbon dioxide (ETCO<sub>2</sub>) level. Oxygen flow rates were maintained at 5 L/min throughout this study.</p><p>After remifentanil reached the target effect-site concentration, desflurane vaporizer was immediately advanced to 2 minimum alveolar concentrations (MAC) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T1">Table 1</xref>) and controlled ventilation continued. The vaporizer was then adjusted so that the end-tidal desflurane concentration could be maintained at 1.7 MAC for 5 minutes (over-pressure paradigm was employed). In previous reports regarding the cardiovascular stimulation effects of desflurane, the same vol% of desflurane was inhaled by all patients regardless of age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> Since MAC of an inhaled anesthetic may differ depending on age, the MAC of desflurane was calculated depending on the age of each patient in this study.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> A gas analyzer (Smart Anesthesia Multi-gas Module&#x02122;, General Electric-Marquette Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) was used to measure the ETCO<sub>2</sub> and end-tidal desflurane concentrations.</p><p>This study was double-blinded. To minimize investigator bias, the desflurane inhalation procedure was performed by one anesthesiologist who did not know the effect-site concentration of the infused remifentanil. SBP, diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), HR and end-tidal desflurane concentration were measured at 1 minute intervals during the 5 minutes of desflurane inhalation by another independent observer.</p><p>The experiment was stopped for appropriate treatments when any of the following side effects developed: 1) MAP less than 50 mm Hg or SBP greater than 190 mm Hg; 2) HR greater than 130 beats per minute or less than 40 beats per minute; 3) MAP greater than 110 mm Hg 5 minutes after inhalation; 4) development of arrhythmia; 5) cases where proper ventilation was not possible (i.e., laryngospasm).</p><p>Patients were intubated 5 minutes after desflurane inhalation.</p></sec><sec><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Sample size calculation was done by G<sup>*</sup> Power (Ver 3.2.1, Kiel, Germany). Through the preliminary tests of five patients per each group, the mean and standard deviation (SD) of SBP and HR were calculated. Using these values, total sample size was calculated as 45 (15 in each group) for the effect size f of 0.49, a power of 80%, and a level of significance of 0.05. Assuming a 50% dropout rate, 23 patients in each group were needed.</p><p>SPSS version 12.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used for statistical analyses and all data were expressed as the mean&#x000b1;SD. Age, weight and height among groups were analyzed with one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and chi-square tests were performed to investigate differences of sex ratios among groups. Shapiro-Wilk tests were used to analyze the distribution of BP, HR, and MAC. A Friedman tests were performed to compare HR according to time and a Wilcoxon-signed rank test with Bonferroni correction for changes of HR as compared with baseline HR within group was performed. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used for comparison of HR among groups at specific time. Repeated measures ANOVA was used for the comparisons of BP and MAC including main effects of remifentanil groups as a between-subject variables and time points of measurements as within-subject variables, and time-group interaction. The sphericity assumption was tested using a Mauchly's test for sphericity and in cases where the sphericity assumption was significantly violated; a Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment of degree of freedom was used. One way ANOVA with a Duncan test as a post-hoc test was used for the comparisons of BP and MAC among groups. Fisher's exact tests were used to compare development frequencies of side effects. <italic>p</italic>-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant.</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>RESULTS</title><p>Sixty-nine patients were recruited for this study and randomly allocated into 3 groups.

However, there are no significant differences in the frequency of side effects among the three groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="T4">Table 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="discussion"><title>DISCUSSION</title><p>The purpose of this study was to determine the appropriate effect-site concentrations of remifentanil to attenuate cardiovascular response that could develop after inhalation of high concentration desflurane. When remifentanil was administered with an effect-site concentration of 4 ng/mL, SBP, DBP, MAP and HR did not significantly change compared with the baseline values measured before induction. The experiment was stopped in only one patient (4.8%) in group R4 and this was the lowest rate among the 3 groups. When remifentanil was administered with an effect-site concentration of 2 ng/mL, SBP, DBP, MAP and HR increased significantly compared with baseline values. The tachycardia or hypertension that was profound enough to discontinue the experiment occurred in 5 of 23 cases (21.7%). Given these findings, it can be assumed that remifentanil at 2 ng/mL did not effectively block increases in SBP, DBP, MAP and HR induced by desflurane. On the other hand, administration of 6 ng/mL decreased SBP, DBP and MAP significantly compared to baseline values. The number of cases that required cessation of the experiment due to hypotension or bradycardia was 3 out of 20 cases (15%). Based on these results, it appears that 6 ng/mL may not be the proper remifentanil concentration for the maintenance of hemodynamic stability. However, no significant differences in the number of patients with side effects were noted among these groups which may be partly due to our small sample sizes.</p><p>In this study, BP and HR showed significant differences among the 3 groups during the initial 3 minutes of desflurane inhalation at about 1 to 1.5 MAC. Our study showed that remifentanil 4 ng/mL is a proper effect-site concentration for the initial 1-3 minutes and there is no clinical difference if 2 ng/mL or 4 ng/mL of remifentanil is administered after the first 3 minutes.</p><p>Ahn, et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B17">17</xref> reported that remifentanil effectively prevented not only cardiovascular adverse reactions, but also airway response during induction with desflurane. In this study, there were no severe adverse reactions in the respiratory system such as laryngospasm for all groups.</p><p>Desflurane induces airway irritation around 1 MAC and sympathetic activation above 1 MAC.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B18">18</xref>-<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B20">20</xref> In previous reports on the cardiovascular stimulation effect of desflurane, 10-11 vol% desflurane corresponding to approximately 1.7 MAC was used.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> However, the MAC of a volatile anesthetic agent may vary depending on body temperature, age, concurrent use of pharmacologic agents (such as alcohol, amphetamine, opioid, ketamine) as well as BP and pregnancy.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B15">15</xref> It is well known that MAC decreases with age.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B16">16</xref> Thus, inhalation of desflurane with the same concentration without an age consideration may lead to desflurane inhalation at different MAC.</p><p>This study attempted to examine the cardiovascular stimulation effect of desflurane with the administration of 1.7 MAC, which would be the MAC-beta-adrenergic response (MAC-BAR). MAC-BAR (1.7-2.0 MAC) is the concentration of inhaled anesthetic required to block the autonomic responses to nociceptive stimuli.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B21">21</xref> In our study, no differences in age corrected MAC of end tidal desflurane concentration among the groups were noted. Since the same MAC of desflurane is achieved in each group, the differences of hemodynamic parameters among the groups may be determined by a concurrent effect-site concentration of remifentanil.</p><p>Concurrent administration of remifentanil with propofol or an inhalation anesthetic may effectively suppress hemodynamic change during surgery without increasing postoperative complications and enable rapid recovery and early extubation.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B22">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B23">23</xref></p><p>It is appropriate to provide a combined administration of desflurane and remifentanil in the following circumstances: 1) cases where meticulous titration is necessary, especially in patients with underlying cardiovascular disorders; 2) cases where prevention of postoperative respiratory depression is required given compromised respiratory function; 3) cases where prolonged duration of anesthetics is expected due to impaired drug metabolism and excretion in patients with hepatic or renal disease; 4) cases of out-patient procedures where rapid emergence and recoveries are needed.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B12">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B24">24</xref></p><p>This study did not have a control group without the remifentanil administration because the previous studies documented increases in BP and HR by inhalation of desflurane only at high concentrations.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> Kim, et al.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> reported that inhalation of high concentrations of desflurane (end-tidal concentration 10 vol%) led to a significant increase in SBP and DBP as well as the HR in ASA physical status class I patients. Ebert and Muzi<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref> reported that increasing the concentration of desflurane from 1.0 MAC (7.25 vol%) to 1.5 MAC (10.9 vol%) led to hypertension and tachycardia due to sympatho-excitation.</p><p>Hemodynamic changes following desflurane inhalation may be different depending on age. In 20 to 50-year-old patients, the most severe changes may develop 60-150 seconds after desflurane inhalation and remarkable rises may continue for 3-4 minutes.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> In our investigation, cardiovascular responses and adverse reactions were observed over the 5 minutes after desflurane inhalation to include the period of the most profound hemodynamic change. However, clinical intubation is performed when muscle relaxation by rocuronium is sufficiently achieved (1.7 minutes).<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B25">25</xref> Thus, the results up to 3 minutes in this study may be applied to the anesthetic induction by desflurane inhalation. When 1.7 MAC desflurane is inhaled during induction, the appropriate effect-site concentration of remifentanil to prevent hemodynamic changes is 4 ng/mL.</p><p>In this study, etomidate was used as an anesthetic induction agent. In previous reports, researchers attempted to eliminate the cardiovascular effects of thiopental sodium by initiating inhalation of desflurane 2 minutes after an infusion of thiopental sodium.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B7">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> Unlike thiopental sodium or propofol, etomidate has less effect on the cardiovascular and respiratory system after infusion of an anesthetic induction dosage.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B11">11</xref> Therefore, we minimized the effects of an induction agent on BP and HR by administrating etomidate.</p><sec><title>Limitation</title><p>This study has several limitations. First, we included only relatively young and healthy patients under 65 years of age. Cardiovascular responses following the inhalation of high concentration desflurane may be different depending on age. A previous study showed that the rate of increase in MAP among patients over 65 years of age was higher than that of other age groups.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B14">14</xref> There was a significant number of patients who had been excluded from the study due to severe increases in BP in elderly patients as compared to other age groups. This may suggest that an experiment targeting elderly patients might have different results. Furthermore, patients with cardiovascular disorders may present with more severe hemodynamic changes. Accordingly, further studies focusing on elderly patients or patients with a cardiovascular disease are needed.</p><p>Second, epinephrine and norepinephrine, which reflect responses of the sympathetic nervous system following desflurane inhalation, were not measured. It has not been elucidated whether or not the effect-site concentration of 4 ng/mL of remifentanil, required for hemodynamic stability, diminishes the responses of the sympathetic nervous system. Evidences that fentanyl and alfentanil may attenuate hemodynamic responses without blunting sympathetic nervous system activation suggest the need for further research on effects of sympathetic nervous system suppression by remifentanil.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B8">8</xref>.<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="B9">9</xref></p><p>Third, our study has no control group.
