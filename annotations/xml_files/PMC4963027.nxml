Intervention group (IG) and control group (CG) were split equally between governmental and private schools. Three educational in-person parents and children sessions were held at 2-month intervals to promote healthy eating habits and exercise. To reinforce the information, a website provided extensive discussion on a new topic every 2 weeks, including school snack menus and tools to calculate body mass index in children and adults. Text messages were sent to parents&#x02019; mobile phones reinforcing the information provided. The IG contained 226 children and CG 181 children.

Therefore, it is important to develop alternative strategies to prevent this health problem from an early age. In the last two decades, overweight and obesity have increased in Mexican children aged 5-11 years. The national nutrition surveys showed that from 1999 to 2006 the prevalence increased from 26.9% to 34.8%. In 2012, the prevalence was 34.4% [<xref rid="ref4" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], indicating that this problem prevails with unacceptably high figures for this age group [<xref rid="ref5" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>].</p><p>Metabolically, obesity is caused by an imbalance in which energy intake exceeds expenditure in a persistent fashion. Low energy expenditure is caused by decreased physical activity and increased sedentary habits [<xref rid="ref6" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>-<xref rid="ref8" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. To neutralize this problem and its comorbidities, intervention studies have been performed to change lifestyles of eating and physical activity, but many have been conducted in minority populations [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>] without a control group [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] for short periods [<xref rid="ref9" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>,<xref rid="ref12" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>] and have had no lasting effect on the body mass index <italic>z</italic>-scores (BMIZ) [<xref rid="ref13" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>,<xref rid="ref14" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The energy imbalance of overweight children results from the unhealthy lifestyles acquired at home, and health providers need to inform parents on how to change unhealthy feeding habits and sedentary habits for better alternatives.</p><p>Studies in children and adolescents have shown that Web-based information improves people&#x02019;s knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors related to feeding and physical activity [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. However, such information is rarely a comprehensive educational intervention [<xref rid="ref10" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>] that also incorporates sociocultural and economic conditions of the target group. Furthermore, there is a need to educate parents about their role in the prevention of obesity. It is expected that information would change feeding behaviors, the types of foods available at home, and preparation and enjoyment of healthy menus. Currently, the Internet and mobile phones are regular informational tools of many households in Mexico City with several apps available for users. In Mexico, the percentage of Internet users nationwide grew from 19.5% to 40.2% from 2006 to 2012, the largest number being in urban areas. In the same period, the rate of mobile phone users increased from 52.6% to 90.8% [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. One advantage of mobile phones for educational purposes is the instantaneous relay of short messages at any time and place.</p><p>The aim of this study was to compare the daily nutrition-based activities performed in schools in Mexico City, such as the availability of healthy food and drinking water [<xref rid="ref18" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="ref19" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>], with an educational intervention involving in-person sessions with parents, distance activities using Web resources and mobile phone reminders, and printed materials in order to improve or at least preserve the BMIZ of Mexican children in elementary schools.</p></sec><sec sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec><title>Design and Study Population</title><p>The study was approved by Research, Ethics, and Biosafety Committees of the Federico Gomez Children&#x02019;s Hospital of Mexico (HIMFG in Spanish), a National Institute of Health. After the Ministry of Public Education granted the authorization to perform the study, 4 elementary schools from a middle-class suburb of Mexico City with similar number of students were included in the study. All school principals granted authorization for the study. The intervention was implemented in 2 schools, 1 governmental and 1 private (intervention group, IG), whereas the other 2 schools, 1 governmental and 1 private, were controls (control group, CG). Before implementation, educational materials and the website were designed and developed, which were the tools of the intervention. The subsequent activities are described as phase 1 of the study. The grades that participated were the first to fourth. Boys and girls were included, regardless of their BMIZ. Before starting the study, both objectives and activities were explained to teachers, parents, and children and also verbal agreement and written informed consent was obtained from children and their parents, respectively.</p></sec><sec><title>Phase 1: Design and Development of Educational Materials and Website</title><sec><title>Artwork That Would Accompany the Messages</title><p>The artworks for this project, such as images of children eating healthy foods, were created by the designers of Universum, the Science Museum of the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM).

Weight was measured with a digital scale (Seca 882; Seca Corp, Hamburg, Germany) with an accuracy of 0.1 kg. Height was measured with a stadiometer (Seca 225; Seca Corp, Hamburg, Germany) with an accuracy of 0.1 cm. Waist circumference was measured with a nonelastic flexible measuring tape (Seca 200). Two trained nutritionists took these measurements according to international procedures [<xref rid="ref28" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. Briefly, the children were measured without shoes and in light clothing, standing in the center of the scale platform or stadiometer, arms resting loosely on the sides, and head positioned in the Frankfort plane. To measure waist circumference, the child climbed an anthropometric box 60 cm tall, the tape was placed at the midpoint between the iliac crest and the lower costal margin, and the reading was taken at the end of a normal exhalation. The purpose of having the child stand on the box was to bring the reader's eyes close to the height of the tape to avoid parallax errors.</p><p>Body mass index (BMI) and BMI <italic>z</italic>-score (BMIZ) are measures used to define obesity. BMI is a measure of weight adjusted for height. It is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. Whereas in adults the BMI cut points that define obesity and overweight are not linked to age and do not differ for males and females, in growing children BMI varies with age and sex. 
For BMI to be meaningful in children it must be compared to a reference-standard that accounts for child age and sex.
Body mass index <italic>z</italic>-scores, also called BMI standard deviation (SD) scores, are measures of relative weight adjusted for child age and sex. Given a child's age, sex, BMI, and an appropriate reference standard, a BMI <italic>z</italic>-score (or its equivalent BMI-for-age percentile) can be determined.</p><p> Children were classified according to the nutritional status as underweight (<italic>z</italic>-score &#x02264; -2), normal weight (-2&#x0003c; <italic>z</italic>-score &#x0003c;1), overweight (1&#x02264; <italic>z</italic>-score &#x0003c;2), or obese (<italic>z</italic>-score &#x02265;2), using as a reference the data from the World Health Organization report of 2007 [<xref rid="ref29" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. Additionally, the waist circumference percentile was calculated with consideration of age, sex, and height, using the tables for Mexican children [<xref rid="ref30" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p><p>After each of the anthropometric measurements, both groups of children were handed a letter with the results of the nutritional status and tips to maintain or improve their health. The recommendations mainly focused on eating and physical activity habits.</p></sec></sec><sec><title>Data Analyses</title><p>Descriptive statistics were used to describe the baseline of the study population. The mean weight and height were adjusted for age and sex by multiple linear regression. The socioeconomic variable was built with the information obtained from the questionnaire on housing characteristics and ownership of property. Households were grouped into tertiles according to their score for socioeconomic status. To compare the groups at baseline, <italic>t</italic> test for independent data was used for continuous variables and the &#x003c7;<sup>2</sup> test was used for categorical data.</p><p>Because, frequently in this type of study, participants do not always follow instructions and consequently adherence is never 100%, we considered it appropriate to perform the data analysis by intention-to-treat, in which all participants assigned to each group are analyzed regardless of their adherence.</p><p>The intragroup BMIZ changes from baseline to 6 months and from baseline to 12 months were compared using paired <italic>t</italic> test. To compare the intergroup BMIZ change, <italic>t</italic> test for independent data was used.</p><p>A model of mixed-effects linear regression was used to assess the change in BMIZ during follow-up. Because children are nested within schools, a mixed model with 3 levels and random intercepts by subject and school were tested. The model was adjusted by the fixed variables of age and BMIZ at baseline. The interaction between the intervention group and the time at each evaluation, 6 and 12 months, was assessed. Mean BMIZ by group (intervention or control) and by time was calculated and a graphic was done using marginal analysis. <italic>P</italic> values &#x0003c; .05 were considered statistically significant for all analyses. The analysis was performed using Stata v12.0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The number of schoolchildren who participated was 226 in the IG and 181 in the CG. The participation rates were 55.2% (226/409) in IG and 44.4% (181/408) in CG. At 12 months, 85% of children in both groups completed the measurements. The proportion of children who did not conclude the study can be attributed to children moving to different schools for personal reasons. However, there was no movement of children between study groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="figure1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>The development of the intervention is presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; among the parents, 51.3% (116/226) attended at least one educational session, 40.7% (92/226) consulted the website, and 91.2% (206/226) received mobile phone messages.

The intervention included in-person and remote activities aimed at parents and children. Comparing the BMIZ during the study with the BMIZ at baseline, in the intervention group BMIZ decreased and in the control group, BMIZ increased. In addition, the intervention maintains the BMIZ of normal weight children and decreased the BMIZ of obese children. Moreover, it is pertinent to emphasize that the strategy described in this report was not intended to treat obesity but sought to reach as many parents as possible to promote changes in the eating and physical activity habits of their children regardless of BMIZ.</p><p>For the management of obese adolescents and adults, the effectiveness of sending information electronically versus individual face-to-face consultation has been compared, and weight reduction is greater in those receiving individual consultation [<xref rid="ref31" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. However, such consultations become unsustainable because of the magnitude of the problem and also because each subject requires a large amount of attention and resources. In this study, the effect of the yearlong follow-up intervention in the whole sample was a BMIZ reduction of 0.10, equivalent to a decrease of 0.4 kg. It is important to mention that studies with similar interventions achieved beneficial effects on BMIZ, whereas others achieved positive changes only in eating and physical activity habits and not the BMIZ [<xref rid="ref17" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>,<xref rid="ref32" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>].</p><p>In this report, when the effect was analyzed by subgroups considering the initial BMIZ, the intervention had a differential effect: the BMIZ of IG children with normal weight was maintained during the follow-up, whereas BMIZ of children from the CG increased. The obese children from the IG reduced 0.22 of BMIZ by 12 months; this effect was greater than that observed in obese children of the CG (-0.06) and the whole population of the intervention group (-0.10). These results are similar to those of a Chilean intervention study that found that obese schoolchildren are the subpopulation with better responses [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].</p><p>In our study, in the children with overweight in the intervention group the BMIZ decreased at 6 months (intervention effect) but this effect disappeared at 12 months; this may be because the parents of these children do not yet perceive the health problem in which their children are immersed, and returned to their usual habits.</p><p>In the IG, the greatest reduction of BMIZ was observed in the first 6 months but did not continue to decrease at 12 months. However, in the subgroup of obese children the BMIZ continued improving after 6 months. This effect has been reported in other study that used a website to send information to parents [<xref rid="ref35" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The question remains as to how much longer the effect of the intervention can last, especially in obese children who continue to improve their BMIZ.</p><p>Concerning obese children of the CG who maintained their BMIZ (rather than increasing it), we propose that parents could have changed to healthier habits after receiving a letter with interpretation of their children&#x02019;s anthropometric measurements and health care recommendations. It has been reported that regular anthropometric measures can improve or reduce BMI [<xref rid="ref36" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>].</p><p>Regardless of the specific intervention, it seems that a crucial element of our strategy was that it targeted parents, who play a central role in promoting healthy habits within the family [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Similar results have been reported by Haerens et al [<xref rid="ref33" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>] in a 2-year follow-up study using electronic means (but no website information) who found that parental involvement was a key factor to maintain BMIZ values. In other studies, in which information was sent to parents via a website, a direct association between the number of visits to the website and reduction in BMIZ was observed [<xref rid="ref15" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="ref16" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="ref37" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In this context, parents who most often consult the website are presumably the most informed and implement more changes in their children&#x02019;s eating habits and physical activity.</p><p>In our study, the parents of 91.2% (206/226) of IG children received text messages, the highest coverage of all the activities of the strategy. Each of the phone messages summarizes a topic that was extensively explained on the website. The use of mobile phones could play an important role in making successful interventions because other studies have found stronger communication effects using text messages versus the Internet [<xref rid="ref38" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Additionally, the use of mobile phones has achieved great efficacy at promoting improvements in maternal and child health in resource-poor countries such as India [<xref rid="ref39" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], and perhaps this device could be useful in crowded cities with scarce means of transportation.</p><p>The main limitations arise in our study: (1) The assignment of participating schools was not randomized. Despite this problem, the BMIZ of the schoolchildren of the IG and CG were comparable at baseline and the effect of the intervention was assessed with the BMIZ change (&#x00394;) during the course of the study. (2) The study participation was approximately 50% and the reasons for nonparticipation should be explored in future studies. Nevertheless, parents of the 2 groups who agreed to participate remained in the study in relatively high proportion at 12 months. (3) The changes in dietary intake and physical activity of participants are not included in this report, and we can only assume that the changes in BMIZ of children were due to the improvement of these habits. (4) The effect of each of the components on BMIZ modification was not evaluated separately in this study because neither in-person activities nor the website consultation showed 100% parental participation. However, the positive effect observed in both normal weight children and obese children of IG possibly is due to the intervention.</p><p>The following are the strengths of this study: (1) The study sent information to parents by several channels, in person, through children, via the Internet, and via mobile phones. The few in-person sessions allowed parents a more efficient use of their time in a large, complex city in which in-person meetings are difficult. (2) The follow-up lasted 12 months, longer than in other studies in which interventions last only a few months. (3) Although the intervention had multiple components, it was affordable. (4) The intervention was not only addressed to the obese population but also involved schoolchildren of all BMI classes. This allowed us to determine that, although the effect of the intervention was greater in children with obesity, children with normal weight maintained their BMI, indicating that exposure to obesity risk factors could be decreased with this type of intervention.</p><p>Fighting overweight and obesity is a complex undertaking, and some intervention studies in schools have shown effectiveness in restraining but not reducing obesity [<xref rid="ref34" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. Other studies have achieved behavioral changes without reducing BMIZ, and further studies focused on prevention rather than obesity treatment are currently required.</p><p>Although the results of this study cannot be generalized, the intervention is promising for implementation of strategies at a distance. Sending information via the Web and smarter mobile phones could encourage better eating and physical activity habits with the aim of preserving or improving children&#x02019;s BMI. In large cities where mobility is difficult but the use of the aforementioned devices has increased [<xref rid="ref11" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>], it could be useful to take advantage of this kind of intervention for the well-being of schoolchildren.</p><p>Lastly, serious and accessible information to promote healthy habits at home, which comes from the school itself, supported by a health institution such as HIMFG, always will be a counterbalance to the commercial information given by the media.</p><p>The comprehensive intervention combining in-person activities with Web-based information and mobile phone messaging maintained the BMIZ of normal weight children and decreased the BMIZ of children with obesity. Thus, this can be an affordable alternative to promote health changes in children at the household level.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>This work was supported by the Hospital Infantil de M&#x000e9;xico Federico G&#x000f3;mez: Fondos Federales HIM/2013/003.
