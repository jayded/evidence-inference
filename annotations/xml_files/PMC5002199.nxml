The primary objective of this process evaluation was to assess the reach, dose delivered, compliance, fidelity, barriers and facilitators, and satisfaction of the intervention. The second objective was to investigate the associations of adherence to the intervention with compliance and with participant satisfaction. Thirdly, we investigated differences between the subgroups within the target population.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>The intervention consisted of a smartphone application, supported by a website. It provided advice on optimal light exposure, sleep, nutrition, and physical activity, tailored to flight and personal characteristics. The reach of the intervention was determined by comparing the intervention group participants and the airline pilots who did not participate. The dose delivered was defined as the total number of participants that was sent an instruction email. Objective compliance was measured through the Control Management System of the application. To determine the fidelity, an extensive log was kept throughout the intervention period. Subjective compliance, satisfaction, barriers, facilitators, and adherence were assessed using online questionnaires. Associations between the extent to which the participants applied the advice in daily life (adherence), compliance, and satisfaction were analysed as well. Finally, outcomes of participants of different age groups and haul types were compared.</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>A total of 2222 pilots were made aware of the study. From this group, 502 pilots met the inclusion criteria and did agree to participate. The reach of the study proved to be 22&#x000a0;% and the dose delivered was 99&#x000a0;%. The included pilots were randomized into the intervention group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;251) or the control group (<italic>n</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;251). Of the intervention group participants, 81&#x000a0;% consulted any advice, while 17&#x000a0;% did this during four weeks or more. Fidelity was 67&#x000a0;%. The participants rated the intervention with a 6.4 (SD 1.6). Adherence was not associated with compliance, but was associated with satisfaction (<italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x02264;&#x02009;0.001). Pilots of 35 to 45&#x000a0;year old were significantly more interested in advice regarding physical activity than their colleagues, and short-haul pilots were more interested in advice regarding nutrition compared to long-haul pilots.</p></sec><sec><title>Conclusions</title><p>The MORE Energy intervention was well received, resulting in an adequate reach and a high dose delivered. The compliance and satisfaction scores indicate that engagement and functionality should be enhanced, and the content and applicability of the advices should be improved to appeal all subgroups of the target population.</p></sec><sec><title>Trial registration</title><p>Nederlands Trial Register <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=2722">NTR2722</ext-link>.

In the aviation industry, fatigue management strategies have been developed to minimize the health effects of these irregular working hours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR3">3</xref>]. Education for flight crew members is an important component of these strategies, for which several educational programs have been developed. Although some of these programs have been studied, the effects and the optimal way to transfer the relevant knowledge remains largely unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR4">4</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR8">8</xref>].</p><p>Literature on computerized health education shows that the content of advice should be tailored to the individual needs and should be applicable for all subgroups within a target population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR10">10</xref>]. Additionally, when translating the relevant flight crew related knowledge into practical advice, variables such as flight direction, flight duration, and number of time zones crossed should be taken into account [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. Based on this knowledge, the MORE Energy intervention, aiming to reduce fatigue and improve health in airline pilots through easy obtainable and tailored advice, was developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>]. The intervention provided participants with evidence-based and relevant fatigue-related advice using a mobile application (app), supported by a website with background information.</p><p>The usage of mobile health (mobile phone technologies in health care and public health) has expanded rapidly during the last decade [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>]. Additionally, because the use of smartphones and tablets increased enormously, apps showed to have great potential for promoting health behaviour [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>]. Evidence for these effects of mobile apps is still limited, however [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR17">17</xref>]. In addition, Blackman et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>] showed that mobile health studies scarcely report about key implementation factors, while this information is necessary to get more insight in the strength and weaknesses of the implementation of the intervention and to facilitate the interpretation of the results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>&#x02013;<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>].</p><p>We, therefore, performed a process evaluation alongside our randomized controlled trial. The primary objective of this process evaluation was to assess the reach, dose delivered, compliance (dose received), fidelity, barriers and facilitators (context), and satisfaction of the MORE Energy intervention. The second objective was to investigate whether the MORE Energy intervention was associated with an improvement in relevant behavior of the participants by exploring the association between compliance to the intervention and the extent to which the pilots adhered, i.e. applied the advice in daily life. We also investigated if adherence was associated with the satisfaction of the pilots. The third objective was to investigate how the intervention suited the different subgroups within the target population. Therefore, outcome differences between pilots of the different age groups and haul types were analysed for the process evaluation items compliance and satisfaction.</p></sec><sec id="Sec2"><title>Methods</title><p>This process evaluation was carried out alongside the randomized controlled trial on the effectiveness of the MORE Energy intervention that aimed to reduce fatigue in airline pilots. The Medical Ethics Committee of the VU University Medical Center (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) assessed the study design and procedures, but according to Dutch law, this study proved to be exempt from a medical ethical review.</p><sec id="Sec3"><title>Participants</title><p>The study population consisted of the pilots of a large internationally operating airline company. The pilots could participate in the study if they were not on sick leave for more than four weeks at the moment of recruitment and if they owned a smartphone or tablet with iOS (iPhone/iPad Operating System) or an Android operating system. After inclusion, the participants were equally randomized into an intervention group, and a control group which received a minimal intervention. Because this process evaluation addresses the MORE Energy intervention, we focus on the participants of the intervention group only.</p></sec><sec id="Sec4"><title>MORE Energy intervention</title><p>The MORE Energy intervention was developed systematically. First, a literature study was performed in order to gain insight in the latest scientific knowledge about optimal behaviour regarding disruption of the circadian rhythm and fatigue in flight crew. Next, focus groups were held to find out what medium and implementation strategy should be used to optimise compliance to the intervention. The focus groups made clear that the intervention should be easy available, appealing, and to be used by pilots of all ages and job types. Further, the advices should be made flight schedule specific and applicable for both short and long-haul pilots. To match the intervention with the legislation and the policy of the airline company, interviews with key management stakeholders were held as well.</p><p>Based on the focus groups and interviews, it was decided to develop a mobile application to transfer the advices to the target population. After the development of the MORE Energy app, it was extensively pre-tested by both pilots and researchers. Based on the results of this first evaluation, the intervention was optimised where necessary.</p><p>The MORE Energy app contained advices on optimal light exposure, sleep, nutrition, and physical activity, tailored to relevant flight (e.g. flight direction, departure and return time, number of time zones crossed) as well as to personal characteristics (e.g. job type, chronotype). The users could choose to consult background information in the glossary menu and the app guided them to a website to read more, or to view and listen to video and audio files concerning the different topics. Participants were encouraged to consider the advices on the app by means of two types of reminders: timed alerts (when the user did not use the app for longer than three weeks) and geofencing alerts (when the user arrived somewhere outside of the Netherlands, with a maximum of one alert per four days). Screenshots of the MORE Energy app can be seen in Additional file <xref rid="MOESM1" ref-type="media">1</xref>. Further details on the development, content and effect evaluation of the intervention have been published elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR11">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR22">22</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec5"><title>Data collection</title><p>The process evaluation items were taken from the Steckler &#x00026; Linnan framework [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]: reach, dose delivered, compliance (dose received), fidelity, barriers and facilitators (context), and satisfaction. Adherence, the extent to which the participants applied the advices in daily life, was measured as well.

Reach was determined by comparing the following characteristics between the intervention group participants and the airline pilots that did not participate: gender, age, job type, and haul type.</p></sec><sec id="Sec7"><title>Dose delivered</title><p>Dose delivered is considered as the total amount of intervention material provided to the participants. In this study, the dose delivered was defined as the total number of participants that was sent an email containing instructions and login details to access the intervention material.</p></sec><sec id="Sec8"><title>Compliance (dose received)</title><p>Compliance is the dose that is received, and refers to the extent to which participants actively engaged with the intervention. In our study, it was objectively measured through the Control Management System (CMS) of the application. This system stored the number of advices per week requested by each participant through user authentication. Likewise, we used a web-analytic tool (Google Analytics) to register and store the total number of page views per participant to the website of the project.</p><p>The registered number of app advices of four participants proved to be more than 200. Because this was most certainly due to malfunctioning of the CMS, the registered data of these participants was excluded from the objective compliance analyses.</p><p>The participants were also asked how often they had consulted the advices during the intervention (almost always, sometimes, only a few times, or never) in the online questionnaire at six months after baseline. Further, participants were asked which type of advice they had predominately used (advice regarding preparation for departure, regarding layover, or regarding the return home) and which topics they had consulted the most (exposure to light, sleep, nutrition, or physical activity).</p></sec><sec id="Sec9"><title>Fidelity</title><p>Fidelity is defined as the extent to which the intervention program was implemented as planned, representing the quality and the integrity of the implementation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR19">19</xref>]. Therefore, all changes, updates, and revisions of the app and website that occurred during the intervention period were kept in a log. Fidelity was calculated as the weighted average of the percentage of weeks of the total intervention period that the different components of the intervention were delivered as intended. As the advice delivered through the app was considered the main component of the intervention, this was given the largest weight, whereas the remaining four components were weighted equally:<list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Access (installation, login, offline functionality): 15&#x000a0;%</p></list-item><list-item><p>Backend (synchronisation of content and flight schedules): 15&#x000a0;%</p></list-item><list-item><p>Advice (tailoring algorithm and glossary): 40&#x000a0;%</p></list-item><list-item><p>Reminders (functioning of push alerts): 15&#x000a0;%</p></list-item><list-item><p>Website with background information (access, functionality): 15&#x000a0;%</p></list-item></list></p></sec><sec id="Sec10"><title>Satisfaction</title><p>The satisfaction with the intervention was assessed through the online questionnaire at six months after baseline. First, the participants were asked to give an overall grade for MORE Energy (1 to 10). Next, they were asked to rate four statements about the usability of the intervention on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from &#x02018;disagree&#x02019; to &#x02018;agree&#x02019;. Additionally, participants were asked if they would recommend the MORE Energy application to their colleagues, and to appreciate the effectiveness of the intervention through rating three statements on perceived effectiveness on the 5-point Likert scale.</p></sec><sec id="Sec11"><title>Barriers and facilitators (context)</title><p>Context refers to &#x0201c;the larger physical, social, and political environment that either directly or indirectly affects an intervention program&#x0201d; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR20">20</xref>]. Possible context factors that affected the intervention were registered in a log. We also asked the participants which barriers or facilitators they had experienced. First, participants were asked if they would recommend the MORE Energy application to colleagues who did not have access to it yet. If they answered &#x02018;no&#x02019;, they were asked why they held that opinion. Next, participants were asked what their reasons were not to consult the advices more often (content already known, no need for further consultation, technical problems, lack of usability, or another reason).</p></sec><sec id="Sec12"><title>Adherence</title><p>The extent to which participants applied the MORE Energy advices in daily life was assessed through asking the participants to rate the statement &#x0201c;After reading the advices, I actually applied them as well.&#x0201d; on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 &#x02018;disagree&#x02019; to 5 &#x02018;agree&#x02019;.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec13"><title>Data analysis</title><p>Regarding the first objective, descriptive analyses were performed. Differences (gender, age, job type, and haul type) between participants and non-participants were analysed with t-tests for independent samples and Chi-square tests.</p><p>For the second objective, associations between compliance and the extent to which the participants applied the advice in daily life (adherence) were analysed by calculating Spearman's (rho) correlation coefficients. Regarding the objective compliance, participants were divided into four groups of equal size related to the amount of compliance. Furthermore, a linear regression analysis was performed to explore the association between the level of adherence (independent variable) and satisfaction with the intervention (dependent variable). Participants who indicated not to have applied the advices in daily life, or who had a neutral opinion towards this question, were used as one reference category in the analysis.</p><p>To answer the third objective, outcomes for the different age groups (&#x0003c;35, &#x02265;35-&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;45, &#x02265;45) and haul types (short-haul vs. long-haul) on compliance and satisfaction were analysed with t-tests for independent samples, Chi-square tests and one-way ANOVAs. Participants who flew to intercontinental destinations were considered long-haul pilots, while participants who only flew to European destinations were considered short-haul pilots.</p><p>A two-tailed significance level of <italic>p</italic>&#x02009;&#x0003c;&#x02009;0.05 was considered to be statistically significant in all analyses.

Predominantly participants with young children and short-haul pilots pointed out this problem. Four participants indicated that they had simply forgotten to consult the app, or that they did not receive an alert to remind them.

The reach among the source population was 22&#x000a0;%. This percentage is quite high compared to the 1.5 to 8&#x000a0;% reach published in other mobile health studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR16">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR23">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR24">24</xref>], and compared to more conventional studies promoting health behaviour at worksites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR25">25</xref>].</p><p>The participating pilots were significantly younger compared to the non-participants, possibly because younger pilots are more familiar with mobile apps. Female pilots were also overrepresented, possibly caused by the fact that women tend to exhibit more active information-seeking behaviour and are more likely to participate in scientific studies than men in general [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR26">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR27">27</xref>].</p><p>It was shown that the dose delivered and initial compliance was high. Of the participants, only 19&#x000a0;% never used any advice on either the app or the website. It is even possible that some of these participants never received the email containing the instructions and login details, because of for instance a strict junk-email filter. However, during the intervention period, only one participant reported not to have received the instruction email.</p><p>The compliance during the whole intervention period was rather low with 17&#x000a0;% of the participants consulting the advices on the app for more than four weeks during six months. Technical problems with some components of the app, as could be seen in the calculation of the fidelity score, might have contributed to this. The fidelity score of 67&#x000a0;% is difficult to interpret since we are the first mobile health study to calculate such a score. Moreover, a mobile health intervention review showed that only 13&#x000a0;% of the published mobile health studies on physical activity promotion reported fidelity information whatsoever [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>Our results showed a distinction between the objectively and subjectively measured compliance regarding the type of advices. Despite the registered data displayed that the advice concerned with departure from home was consulted most often, the participants themselves indicated that they used the advice concerned with layovers the most. It might be possible that the participants thought that they were asked <italic>when</italic> they had used the advice most often. This would also explain the finding that short-haul pilots indicated to have used the layover advice the most although that type of advice was not available for them; they might have predominately considered the advice regarding their next flight at the end of a duty day (i.e. during their layover).</p><p>Despite the moderate compliance scores, a majority of the users (65&#x000a0;%) was convinced that the intervention was able to fulfill its purpose, preventing fatigue and improving health of pilots. Also, 78&#x000a0;% of the participants would recommend the intervention to their colleagues. In this perspective, the 6.4 (range 1 to 10) appreciation score for the MORE Energy intervention as a whole, is somewhat low. On the other hand, a majority of the pilots (54&#x000a0;%) did not agree with the statement that the advices were easy to apply in daily life. This lack of applicability of the flight schedule specific advices was also shown in the barriers and facilitators section. Participants indicated that applying the advices would conflict with their social life at home (e.g. young children) or during duty (e.g. habits during layovers). Furthermore, the correlation between registered compliance and adherence proved to be very low (<italic>r</italic>&#x02009;=&#x02009;0.041). This might indicate that although participants were interested to see what advice the app would provide regarding their upcoming flight schedule, the content did not pursue them to change their behavior. However, once applied, the advices might have been useful: participants that did indicate to have applied the advices in daily life rated the intervention significantly higher compared to the participants who did not apply them.</p><p>Another objective of this process evaluation was to assess whether there was a difference in compliance and satisfaction outcomes between participants of the two haul types and the three age groups present in the population. The results showed that the differences in both objective and subjective compliance between the age groups were small. The oldest participants tended to be the most critical regarding the applicability of the advices. Possibly, these pilots were unwilling to give up the patterns and habits which they developed throughout their career. This was already mentioned during the focus group interviews before the development of the intervention: it would be hard to alter the (social) patterns of the more experienced colleagues. The apparent contradicting high percentage of the oldest group of pilots (85&#x000a0;%) that would recommend MORE Energy to their colleagues may be in accordance: these pilots do not need the advice for themselves but they think it might be useful for their less experienced colleagues.</p><p>Regarding the participants of the two haul types, no significant differences in objective compliance existed either. The relatively large number of short-haul pilots that participated in the study did find the advices easy to apply, but found them not very useful. Consequently, short-haul pilots tended to be less satisfied with the intervention compared to the long-haul pilots. Although the operations of the two haul types differ substantially, short-haul schedules can trigger fatigue as much as intercontinental schedules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR28">28</xref>]. However, most of the scientific knowledge and practical advice available concerns the disruption of the circadian rhythm and is mostly applicable for long-haul pilots. Consequently, the content of our specific advice regarding short-haul schedules was less extensive. The short-haul pilots participating in the test phase of the intervention noticed this already. Although we reconsidered and extended the short-haul advices afterwards, the outcomes of our process evaluation indicate that this elaboration was probably not sufficient.</p></sec><sec id="Sec29"><title>Strength and limitations</title><p>This process evaluation is one of the first evaluating an mobile health intervention promoting health behaviour. One of the major strengths is that we used a combination of objective and self-reported data to evaluate the implementation of the MORE Energy intervention. The compliance with both the app and the website was registered through user authentication, which is more reliable than self-reported information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR29">29</xref>]. Nevertheless, most probably due to malfunctioning of the CMS, data of four participants had to be excluded from the analyses. We did use self-reported data as well, to gather more detailed information on subject specific compliance, adherence and appreciation.</p><p>We achieved a reach of 22&#x000a0;%. Although this is quite high compared to participation rates published in other mobile health studies, the generalizability of the results might be hampered due to selection effects. It is possible that the non-participating pilots did not possess an iOS or Android smartphone or tablet, or were not sufficiently familiar with mobile apps. The comparison of the participants with the non-participants also showed that participants were significantly younger, and that a relatively large number of female pilots participated.</p><p>Another limitation of this study is that only 59&#x000a0;% of the participants filled out the process evaluation questionnaire. Therefore, selection bias may have occurred, which challenges the reliability and validity of the outcomes. Another limitation of the study is that we could not measure all activities of the users of the mobile app. The number and types of requested advices were registered, but consultation of the background information and time spent on the app was not.</p><p>The MORE Energy intervention aimed to improve relevant behaviour among airline pilots. Although we asked participants whether they had applied the advices in daily life, their actual change in behaviour could not be objectively measured. Therefore, to maximize the interpretation of our results, it would have been useful if the app had used more built-in features of smartphones to measure behaviour (e.g. timing of sleep using the motion sensor of the mobile device) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR13">13</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="Sec30"><title>Implications for research and practice</title><p>The reach of this study shows that airline pilots are willing to participate in an intervention using an app to promote health behaviour. Although guidelines have been proposed to improve the way the outcomes of mobile health interventions are reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR21">21</xref>], qualitative process evaluations publications are necessary as well in order to provide more information about the implementation and working mechanisms of these kind of interventions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR18">18</xref>].</p><p>High compliance is important for the success of any intervention intending to modify behaviour, but especially so in web-based interventions since there is no direct contact with the participants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR14">14</xref>]. Because we found that compliance dropped since the start of the intervention, similar studies should put more effort into keeping participants involved throughout the intervention period. Although technical problems were not mentioned as main reasons for non-compliance, time consuming update installations and the resulting loss in functionality, might have been of influence. One of the updates during the intervention period caused the malfunctioning of the reminder alerts. This might have led to a decrease in compliance since well-timed and adequate prompts can be effectively used in mobile health intervention studies. Other possibilities that could keep users engaged involve altering and updating the content of the intervention material, providing personal feedback, and introducing goal setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR12">12</xref>].</p><p>Our process evaluation gives insight into the different aspects involved in the implementation of the MORE Energy intervention, and will help to improve the interpretation of the results of the trial. The outcomes of the different items showed which parts of the intervention should be improved before offering the intervention to all flight crew throughout the airline company. First, the app should pursue users more to change relevant behavior, despite the consequences for their social responsibilities. Further, the content of the advice should be better applicable for both experienced and inexperienced employees, involved in both short and long-haul schedules. The airline company involved can assist the subsequent implementation of the improved app by integrating it with flight crew scheduling, by giving sustained attention to the topic within the present flight crew members, and by introducing the tool to newly hired employees [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CR7">7</xref>]. After the improvement of the MORE Energy intervention, it might be transformed into a &#x02018;white label&#x02019; tool in order to make it possible to adapt and implement it as a fatigue management tool for flight crew members or shift workers in other companies as well.</p></sec></sec><sec id="Sec31"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The process evaluation of MORE Energy showed that this mobile health intervention was well received, resulting in an adequate reach and a high dose delivered. Although more than 80&#x000a0;% of the participants did use the intervention, most of them were not compliant throughout the intervention period. The intervention could not be delivered as intended and perceived satisfaction was moderate. Further, the combination of compliance and satisfaction scores indicates that the content and applicability of the advices should be improved to appeal all subgroups first, before making the app available for the other flight crew members within the airline company. After this improvement, MORE Energy might be adapted and implemented as a fatigue management tool for other employees and companies as well.</p></sec></body><back><app-group><app id="App1"><sec id="Sec32"><title>Additional files</title><p><media position="anchor" xlink:href="12889_2016_3572_MOESM1_ESM.pdf" id="MOESM1"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>Screenshots of the mobile application used during the MORE Energy intervention.
