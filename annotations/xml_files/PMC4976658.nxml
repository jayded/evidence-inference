Pain catastrophizing refers to the tendency to ruminate about pain and magnify it. Somers et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">10</xref></sup> reported in a cross-sectional setting that pain catastrophizing explained a significant proportion of the variance in measures of pain, psychological disability, physical disability and gait velocity in overweight and obese patients with knee osteoarthritis. Fear of movement or kinesiophobia is another variable used to describe negatively charged emotions towards pain and function. Heuts et al.<sup><xref rid="bibr11-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">11</xref></sup> concluded that pain-related fear was significantly associated with functional limitations among osteoarthritis patients. Self-efficacy, on the other hand, represents a more positive aspect of adjusting to pain. Self-efficacy is a concept used to describe the strength of one&#x02019;s beliefs in one&#x02019;s ability to complete tasks and reach goals. According to a systematic review by Benyon et al.,<sup><xref rid="bibr6-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">6</xref></sup> there is strong evidence that self-efficacy predicts disability but not pain among osteoarthritis patients.</p><p>Several psychological variables have been studied in relation to pain and function among patients with chronic musculoskeletal diseases. However, the number of studies investigating the predictive role of psychological factors in knee osteoarthritis is somewhat scarcer. In this analysis, we assessed whether disease-specific, demographic and psychological factors at baseline predict self-reported pain and function during a one-year follow-up of a randomized controlled trial among patients with knee osteoarthritis.<sup><xref rid="bibr12-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">12</xref></sup></p></sec><sec sec-type="subjects|methods" id="section9-0269215515619660"><title>Patients and methods</title><p>The study participants were 111 patients with radiologically (Kellgren-Lawrence 2&#x02013;4)<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> diagnosed knee osteoarthritis and associated pain symptoms.

Since the time-by-treatment interaction was non-significant in all outcomes, we decided to remove the term from both of the models. As group randomization did not show any significance as a covariate in either of the models, one can conclude that the intervention of the original randomized controlled trial did not have any effect on the outcome variables.

This, in turn, may result from the recruitment process of the original randomized controlled trial: The candidates had to take the initiative to participate in the study. In addition, severe psychiatric conditions were criteria for exclusion.</p><p>The importance of psychological resource factors was emphasized in relation to measures of function of knee osteoarthritis patients.

Earlier studies<sup><xref rid="bibr31-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">31</xref></sup> have reported similar findings. Among the disease-related variables, the radiographic severity of knee osteoarthritis had predictive value for generic measures of function (RAND-36 function, mental and physical summaries). However, findings from previous studies have been somewhat contradictory on this matter.<sup><xref rid="bibr5-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">5</xref></sup> Additionally, baseline values for WOMAC pain and function and RAND-36 physical component summaries were significantly better than follow-up average values, a phenomenon demonstrated in several previous studies among osteoarthritis patients.<sup><xref rid="bibr40-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">40</xref></sup></p><p>The strengths of the present study include the repeated examination of a number of pain, function and psychological outcomes and the use of X-ray with at least Kellgren-Lawrence 2<sup><xref rid="bibr13-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">13</xref></sup> scale knee osteoarthritis to confirm the diagnosis of knee osteoarthritis. Furthermore, the study sample can be considered representative of ordinary community-dwelling knee osteoarthritis patients, as most of the participants (77%, <italic>n</italic> = 86) were enrolled in the study as a result of a previous referral to a knee X-ray by their general practitioners. On the other hand, a central limitation of this analysis could be the fact that the study patients were too tightly selected due to the inclusion criteria of the original randomized controlled trial. Firstly, the patients had to have quite a high WOMAC pain subscale level (VAS &#x02a7e;40/100 mm) to be included. Almost half of the study candidates (47%, <italic>n</italic> = 209) had to be excluded because their WOMAC pain level was too low.<sup><xref rid="bibr14-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">14</xref></sup> Secondly, the recruitment process may have resulted in the selection of patients who were more active and better off in some aspects of psychological well-being than the average knee osteoarthritis patient.</p><p>The current analysis added to the limited number of prospective studies concerning the impact of psychological factors on pain and function in knee osteoarthritis patients. To our knowledge, the results provided some new information on the predictive role of pain catastrophizing, kinesiophobia and life satisfaction in self-reported pain and function in this particular patient group. Moreover, the finding that the radiographic severity of knee osteoarthritis had predictive value for generic measures of function was interesting. In general, the results call for the routine assessment of multiple psychological factors in knee osteoarthritis to identify those patients or sub-groups of patients who need additional behavioural and psychological attention.<sup><xref rid="bibr10-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="bibr41-0269215515619660" ref-type="bibr">41</xref></sup> Not taking these factors into considerations will probably contribute to prolonged disability and further pain.</p><boxed-text id="boxed-text1-0269215515619660" position="float" orientation="portrait"><caption><title>Clinical messages</title></caption><list list-type="bullet" id="list1-0269215515619660"><list-item><p>Among knee osteoarthritis patients, the absence of anxiety symptoms at baseline was a strong predictor of milder pain and better function during the follow-up.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Life satisfaction and pain self-efficacy predicted better function among knee osteoarthritis patients.</p></list-item><list-item><p>A low level of pain catastrophizing and kinesiophobia predicted milder symptoms of knee osteoarthritis.</p></list-item></list></boxed-text></sec></body><back><ack><p>We thank the physicians who helped with patient recruitment at Kuopio Health Centre and Kuopio University Hospital, data manager Pauli Kuosmanen of Kuopio Health Centre for technical support, statistician Tuomas Selander of Kuopio University Hospital for advice in statistical matters, and Professor Olli-Pekka Ryyn&#x000e4;nen of Kuopio University Hospital Primary Health Care Unit for creating the code for randomization.
