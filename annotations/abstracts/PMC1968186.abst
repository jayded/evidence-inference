TITLE: 
Combination or mild single agent chemotherapy for advanced breast cancer? CMF vs epirubicin measuring quality of life.



Forty patients with advanced breast cancer, randomised to receive CMF or weekly low dose Epirubicin, were evaluated by UICC criteria of response and WHO toxicity criteria, in addition to three QoL instruments: the 'Qualitator' daily diary card, 4 weekly Nottingham Health Profile (NHP) and Linear Analogue Self-Assessment (LASA). Response rates were 58% for CMF and 29% for epirubicin (chi 2 = 3.51, 1 d.f., P > 0.05). Median time to treatment failure was 24 weeks for CMF, 7 weeks for epirubicin (P < 0.05) but survival was similar in both groups. Survival was better for responders than for non-responders (medians 87 and 30 weeks, P = 0.02). CMF caused more objective alopecia (P < 0.001), nausea and vomiting (P < 0.001) and haematological toxicity (P < 0.02). However, QoL measures only recorded a significant difference in energy and pain, influenced primarily by the non-responders in each treatment group but with no difference in overall global scores. Scores for responders, irrespective of treatment, were better to start with (LASA P = 0.001); at 12 weeks, scores had improved (Qualitator P < 0.05; NHP P < 0.05). Scores in non-responders showed no change. In this small study aggressive chemotherapy gave better response and similar survival without impairing Quality of life overall. Detailed QoL measurement should be integral to all cancer chemotherapy trials.
