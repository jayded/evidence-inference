TITLE: 
Comparison between swallowing and chewing of garlic on levels of serum lipids, cyclosporine, creatinine and lipid peroxidation in Renal Transplant Recipients



Abstract   Hyperlipidemia  and  increased  degree  of  oxidative  stress  are  among  the  important   risk  factors  for  Atherosclerosis  in  renal  transplant  recipients  (RTR).  The  Medical   treatment of hyperlipidemia in RTR because of drugs side effects has been problematic,   therefore  alternative  methods  such  as  using  of  Garlic  as  an  effective  material  in   cholesterol lowering and inhibition of LDL Oxidation has been noted. For evaluation of   garlic effect on RTR, 50 renal transplant patients with stable renal function were selected   and divided into 2 groups. They took one clove of garlic (1 gr) by chewing or swallowing   for  two months,  after  one month wash-out  period,  they  took  garlic  by  the  other  route.   Results indicated that although lipid profile, BUN, Cr, serum levels of cyclosporine and   diastolic blood pressure did not change, Systolic blood pressure decreased from138.2 to   132.8 mmHg (p=0.001) and Malondialdehyde (MDA) decreased from 2.4 to1.7 nmol/ml   (p=0.009)  by  swallowing  route,  Cholesterol  decreased  from  205.1  to  195.3  mg/dl   (p=0.03),  triglyceride  decreased  from  195.7  to 174.8 mg/dl  (p=0.008), MDA  decreased   from 2.5 to 1.6 nmol/ml (p=0.001), systolic blood pressure decreased from 137.5 to 129.8   mmHg (p=0.001), diastolic blood pressure decreased from 84.6 to 77.6 mmHg (p=0.001)   and  Cr  decreased  from  1.51  to  1.44 mg/dl  (p=0.03)  by  chewing  route  too.   However   HDL,  LDL  and  cyclosporine  serum  levels  had  no  significant  differences  by  both  of   swallowing and chewing routes.   We conclude that undamaged garlic (swallowed) had no lowering effect on lipid level of   serum. But Crushed  garlic  (chewed)  reduces  cholesterol,  triglyceride, MDA  and  blood   pressure. Additionally creatinine reduced without notable decrease in cyclosporine serum   levels may be due to cyclosporine nephrotoxicity ameliorating effect of garlic.
