TITLE: Abdominal Wound Problems After Hysterectomy With
Electrocautery vs. Scalpel Subcutaneous Incision

ABSTRACT 
  ABSTRACT: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between postoperative abdominal incision
problems and opening subcutaneous tissues with electrocautery or scalpel. Women scheduled for
elective abdominal hysterectomy who gave informed consent were randomly assigned to subcutaneous
abdominal wall tissue incision by electrocautery or scalpel. Postoperative abdominal wound
problem diagnoses included seroma, hematoma, infection, or dehiscence without identifiable etiology.
Fifteen of 380 women (3.9%) developed a wound problem; six had scalpel and nine had
electrosurgical subcutaneous incisions (P = 0.4). Thicker subcutaneous tissues (P = 0.04) and concurrent
pelvic infection (P < 0.001) were significant risk factors for postoperative wound problems.
Only two women (0.5%) developed an infection. We conclude that the method of subcutaneous
tissue incision was unrelated to the development of postoperative abdominal incision problems in
380 women undergoing elective abdominal hysterectomy.
