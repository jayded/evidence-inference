TITLE: Episiotomy repair: Vicryl versus Vicryl rapide.

  ABSTRACT:
Women suffer a significant degree of perineal morbidity in the postpartum period. For some, it can be significant and interfere with daily activities. Although there seems to be no doubt that polyglycolic acid derivatives are superior to non absorbable sutures with regard to wound healing, problems still occur with their use. In this study a relatively new product, Vicryl rapide, was compared with Vicryl.
